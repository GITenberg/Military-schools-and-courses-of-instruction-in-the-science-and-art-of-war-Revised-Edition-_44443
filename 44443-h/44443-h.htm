<p>The second and longer Table of Contents was printed at the end of the
volume. There is a <a href =
"MilitarySchools1.html#toc_poly">supplementary table of contents</a>
partway through the France section, covering only the Polytechnic. The
relationship between the Tables of Contents (all) and the printed
book is casual at best; information may have been accurate for the first
edition. Except in the case of apparent typographical error,
discrepancies were left as printed.</p>

<p>The section on Switzerland (Part IX) was printed after the section on
Great Britain (Part VIII). For this e-text it has been grouped with the
smaller countries (Parts III through VIII).</p>

<p><span class = "firstword">The</span> first edition of Military
Schools in France and Prussia was issued in 1862, as a number of the
American Journal of Education; and subsequently in the same year this
portion was printed as Part&nbsp;I. of a comprehensive survey of the
whole field of Instruction in the Science and Art of War in different
countries. The circumstances under which the publication was begun, are
set forth in the Preface to the imperfect edition of 1862. Now that the
survey in the serial chapters of the Journal is as complete as the
material at the command of the Editor, and the space which he can give
to this special subject enable him to make it, the several chapters have
been revised and brought together in a single volume, to present the
actual condition of this important department of national education in
the principal states of Europe, as well as in our own country.</p>

<p>It is due to the late Col. Samuel Colt, the inventor of the Colt
Revolver, and the founder of the Colt Patent Fire-Arms Factory&mdash;two
enterprises which have changed the character and the mode of
constructing fire-arms in every country&mdash;to state that the
information contained in the first edition of this Treatise, was
collected and prepared at his request, to assist him in maturing the
plan of a School of Mechanical Engineering, which he proposed to
establish on his estate at Hartford, and on which, after the breaking
out of the War of Secession, he decided to engraft both military drill,
and military history, and to give that scientific instruction which
every graduate of our national Military and Naval Academies ought to
possess. Soon after Col. Colt’s death (Jan. 10, 1862), Mrs. Elizabeth
Jarvis Colt, learning what had been done in the direction of her
husband’s wishes, authorized the use which has been made, of the
material already collected, in the preparation of this treatise, and of
the volume already published on Technical Schools in different
countries, and of any more which might be collected and prepared at her
expense, to illustrate any department of his plan of a scientific school
at Hartford.</p>

<p><span class = "firstword">An</span> account of the Military and Naval
Schools of different countries, with special reference to the extension
and improvement, among ourselves, of similar institutions and agencies,
both national and state, for the special training of officers and men
for the exigencies of war, was promised by the Editor in his original
announcement of “<i>The American Journal and Library of Education</i>.”
Believing that the best preparation for professional and official
service of any kind, either of peace or war, is to be made in the
thorough culture of all manly qualities, and that all special schools
should rest on the basis, and rise naturally out of a general system of
education for the whole community, we devoted our first efforts to the
fullest exposition of the best principles and methods of elementary
instruction, and to improvements in the organization, teaching, and
discipline of schools, of different grades, but all designed to give a
proportionate culture of all the faculties. We have from time to time
introduced the subject of Scientific Schools&mdash;or of institutions in
which the principles of mathematics, mechanics, physics, and chemistry
are thoroughly mastered, and their applications to the more common as
well as higher arts of construction, machinery, manufactures, and
agriculture, are experimentally taught. In this kind of instruction must
we look for the special training of our engineers, both civil and
military; and schools of this kind established in every state, should
turn out every year a certain number of candidates of suitable age to
compete freely in open examinations for admission to a great National
School, like the Polytechnic at Paris, or the purely scientific course
of the Military Academy at West Point, and then after two years of
severe study, and having been found qualified by repeated examinations,
semi-annual and final, by a board composed, not of honorary visitors,
but of experts in each science, should pass to schools of application or
training for the special service for which they have a natural aptitude
and particular preparation.</p>

<p>The terrible realities of our present situation as a people&mdash;the
fact that within a period of twelve months a million of able bodied men
have been summoned to arms from the peaceful occupations of the office,
the shop, and the field, and are now in hostile array, or in actual
conflict, within the limits of the United States, and the no less
alarming aspect of the future, arising not only from the delicate
position of our own relations with foreign governments, but from the
armed interference of the great Military Powers of Europe in the
internal affairs of a neighboring republic, have brought up the subject
of <span class = "smallcaps">Military Schools, and Military
Education</span>, for consideration and action with an urgency which
admits of no delay. Something must and will be done at once. And in
reply to numerous letters for information and suggestions, and to enable
those who are urging the National, State or Municipal authorities to
provide additional facilities for military instruction, or who may
propose to establish schools, or engraft on existing schools exercises
for this purpose,&mdash;to profit by the experience of our own and other
countries, in the work of training officers and men for the <span class
= "smallcaps">Art of War</span>, we shall bring together into a single
volume, “<i>Papers on Military Education</i>,” which it was our
intention to publish in successive numbers of the <span class =
"smallcaps">New Series</span> of the “<i>American Journal of
Education</i>.”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page8" id = "page8">8</a></span>
<p>This volume, as will be seen by the Contents, presents a most
comprehensive survey of the Institutions and Courses of Instruction,
which the chief nations of Europe have matured from their own
experience, and the study of each other’s improvements, to perfect their
officers for every department of military and naval service which the
exigences of modern warfare require, and at the same time, furnishes
valuable hints for the final organization of our entire military
establishments, both national and state.</p>

<p>We shall publish in the Part devoted to the United States, an account
of the Military Academy at West Point, the Naval Academy at Newport, and
other Institutions and Agencies,&mdash;State, Associated, and
Individual, for Military instruction, now in existence in this country,
together with several communications and suggestions which we have
received in advocacy of Military Drill and Gymnastic exercises in
Schools. We do not object to a moderate amount of this Drill and these
exercises, properly regulated as to time and amount, and given by
competent teachers. There is much of great practical value in the
military element, in respect both to physical training, and moral and
mental discipline. But we do not believe in the physical degeneracy, or
the lack of military aptitude and spirit of the American people&mdash;at
least to the extent asserted to exist by many writers on the subject.
And we do not believe that any amount of juvenile military drill, any
organization of cadet-corps, any amount of rifle or musket practice, or
target shooting, valuable as these are, will be an adequate substitute
for the severe scientific study, or the special training which a well
organized system of military institutions provides for the training of
officers both for the army and navy.</p>

<p>Our old and abiding reliance for industrial progress, social well
being, internal peace, and security from foreign aggression rests
on:&mdash;</p>

<p>I. The better Elementary education of the whole people&mdash;through
better homes and better schools&mdash;through homes, such as
Christianity establishes and recognizes, and schools, common because
cheap enough for the poorest, and good enough for the best,&mdash;made
better by a more intelligent public conviction of their necessity, and a
more general knowledge among adults of the most direct modes of
effecting their improvement, and by the joint action of more intelligent
parents, better qualified teachers, and more faithful school officers.
This first great point must be secured by the more vigorous prosecution
of all the agencies and measures now employed for the advancement of
public schools, and a more general appreciation of the enormous amount
of stolid ignorance and half education, or mis-education which now
prevails, even in states where the most attention has been paid to
popular education.</p>

<p>II. The establishment of a System of Public High Schools in every
state&mdash;far more complete than exists at this time, based on the
system of Elementary Schools, into which candidates shall gain admission
only after having been found qualified in certain studies by an open
examination. The studies of this class of schools should be preparatory
both in literature and science for what is now the College Course, and
for what is now also the requirements in mathematics in the Second
Year’s Course at the Military Academy at West Point.</p>

<p>III. A system of Special Schools, either in connection with existing
Colleges, or on an independent basis, in which the principles of science
shall be taught with special reference to their applications to the Arts
of Peace and War. Foremost in this class should stand a National School
of Science, organized and conducted on the plan of the Polytechnic
School of France, and preparatory to Special Military and Naval
Schools.</p>

<p>IV. The Appointment to vacancies, in all higher Public Schools,
either among teachers or pupils, and in all departments of the Public
Service by Open Competitive Examination.</p>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
