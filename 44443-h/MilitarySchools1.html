SCHOOLS OF FRANCE</a></h3>

<h4><a name = "france_system" id = "france_system" href = "#france">I.
MILITARY SYSTEM.</a></h4>

<p><span class = "firstword">The</span> French armies are composed of
soldiers levied by yearly conscription for a service of seven years.
Substitutes are allowed, but in accordance with a recent alteration,
they are selected by the state. Private arrangements are no longer
permitted; a fixed sum is paid over to the authorities, and the choice
of the substitutes made by them.</p>

<p>The troops are officered partly from the military schools and partly
by promotion from the ranks. The proportions are established by law.
One-third of the commissions are reserved for the military schools, and
one-third left for the promotion from the ranks. The disposal of the
remaining third part is left to the Emperor.</p>

<p>The promotion is partly by seniority and partly by selection.</p>

<p>The following regulations exist as to the length of service in each
rank before promotion can be given, during a period of peace:&mdash;</p>

<table class = "plaintext reduced">
<tr>
<td>A second Lieutenant</td>
<td>can not be</td>
<td>promoted to</td>
<td>Lieutenant</td>
<td>under</td>
<td>2</td>
<td>years’ service.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>A Lieutenant</td>

<td class = "ditto">“</td>
<td class = "ditto">“</td>
<td>Colonel</td>
<td class = "ditto">“</td>
<td>2</td>
<td class = "ditto">“</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>But in time of war these regulations are not in force.</p>

<p>Up to the rank of captain, two-thirds of the promotion takes place
according to seniority, and the other one-third by selection.</p>

<p>From the rank of captain to that of major (<i>chef de bataillon ou
d’escadron</i>) half of the promotion is by seniority and the other half
by selection, and from major upwards, it is entirely by selection.</p>

<p>The steps which lead to the selection are as follows:&mdash;The
general officers appointed by the minister at war to make the annual
inspections of the several divisions of the army of France, who are
called inspectors-general, as soon as they have completed their tours of
inspection, return to Paris and assemble together for the purpose of
comparing their notes respecting the officers they have each seen, and
thus prepare a list arranged in the order in which they recommend that
the selection for promotion should be made.</p>

<p>We were informed that the present minister of war almost invariably
promoted the officers from the head of this list, or, in other words,
followed the recommendation of the inspector-general.</p>

Department of the Cavalry School at Saumur has lately been absorbed.</p>

<p>5. The Military Orphan School (<i>Prytanée Impériale Militaire</i>)
at La Flèche.</p>

<p>6. The Medical School (<i>Ecole Impériale de Médicine et de Pharmacie
Militaires</i>.) recently established in connection with the Hospital of
Val-de-Grâce.</p>

<p>7. The School of Musketry (<i>Ecole Normale de Tir</i>) at Vincennes,
founded in 1842.</p>

<p>8. The Gymnastic School (<i>Ecole Normale de Gymnastique</i>) near
Vincennes.</p>

<p>9. The Music School (<i>Gymnase Musical</i>.)</p>

<p>10. The Regimental Schools (<i>Ecoles Régimentaires</i>.)</p>
</div>

<p>The military schools are under the charge of the minister of war,
with whom the authorities of the schools are in direct
communication.</p>

<p>The expenses to the state of the military schools, including the pay
of the military men who are employed in connection with them, for the
year 1851, are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>From this sum, 2,224,542<i>fr.</i>, should be deducted
421,372<i>fr.</i> secured from paying pupils, leaving the total cost to
the state to be 1,803,308<i>fr.</i>, or about $360,000, for about 2,100
pupils. The cost to the state for training an officer of Artillery and
Engineers is about $1,500, and that of an officer of the Staff is about
$1,400.</p>

<span class = "submini">IN MATHEMATICS AS PRESCRIBED FOR ADMISSION TO
THE POLYTECHNIC SCHOOL OF FRANCE.</span></a></h4>

<p><span class = "firstword">“L’École Polytechnique”</span> is too well
known, by name at least, to need eulogy in this journal. Its course of
instruction has long been famed for its completeness, precision, and
adaptation to its intended objects. But this course had gradually lost
somewhat of its symmetrical proportions by the introduction of some new
subjects and the excessive development of others. The same defects had
crept into the programme of the subjects of examination for admission to
the school. Influenced by these considerations, the Legislative Assembly
of France, by the law of June 5th, 1850, appointed a “<i>Commission</i>”
to revise the programmes of admission and of internal instruction. The
President of the Commission was <span class =
"smallcaps">Thenard</span>, its “Reporter” was <span class =
"smallcaps">Le Verrier</span>, and the other nine members were worthy to
be their colleagues. They were charged to avoid the error of giving to
young students, subjects and methods of instruction “too elevated, too
abstract, and above their comprehension;” to see that the course
prescribed should be “adapted, not merely to a few select spirits, but
to average intelligences;” and to correct “the excessive development of
the preparatory studies, which had gone far beyond the end desired.”</p>

<p>The Commission, by M. Le Verrier, prepared an elaborate report of 440
quarto pages, only two hundred copies of which were printed, and these
merely for the use of the authorities. A&nbsp;copy belonging to a
deceased member of the Commission (the lamented Professor <i>Theodore
Olivier</i>), having come into the hands of the present writer, he has
thought that some valuable hints for our use in this country might be
drawn from it, presenting as it does a precise and thorough course of
mathematical instruction, adapted to any latitude, and arranged in the
most perfect order by such competent authorities. He has accordingly
here presented, in a condensed form, the opinions of the Commission on
<i>the proper subjects for examination in mathematics, preparatory to
admission to the Polytechnic School, and the best methods of teaching
them</i>.</p>

<p>The subjects which will be discussed are <span class =

href = "#poly_admit">I. ARITHMETIC.</a></h5>

<p>A knowledge of Arithmetic is indispensable to every one. The
merchant, the workman, the engineer, all need to know how to calculate
with rapidity and precision. The useful character of arithmetic
indicates that its methods should admit of great simplicity, and that
its teaching should be most carefully freed from all needless
complication. When we enter into the spirit of the methods of
arithmetic, we perceive that they all flow clearly and simply from the
very principles of numeration, from some precise definitions, and from
certain ideas of relations between numbers, which all minds easily
perceive, and which they even possessed in advance, before their teacher
made them recognize them and taught them to class them in a methodical
and fruitful order. We therefore believe that there is no one who is not
capable of receiving, of understanding, and of enjoying well-arranged
and well-digested arithmetical instruction.</p>

<p>But the great majority of those who have received a liberal education
do not possess this useful knowledge. Their minds, they say, are not
suited to the study of mathematics. They have found it impossible to
bend themselves to the study of those abstract sciences whose barrenness
and dryness form so striking a contrast to the attractions of history,
and the beauties of style and of thought in the great poets; and so
on.</p>

<p>Now, without admitting entirely the justice of this language, we do
not hesitate to acknowledge, that the teaching of elementary mathematics
has lost its former simplicity, and assumed a complicated and
pretentious form, which possesses no advantages and is full of
inconveniences. The reproach which is cast upon the sciences in
themselves, we out-and-out repulse, and apply it only to the vicious
manner in which they are now taught.</p>

<p>Arithmetic especially is only an instrument, a tool, the theory of
which we certainly ought to know, but the practice of which it is above
all important most thoroughly to possess. The methods of analysis and of
mechanics, invariably lead to solutions whose applications require
reduction into numbers by arithmetical calculations. We may add that the
numerical determination of the final result is almost always
indispensable to the clear and complete comprehension of a method ever
so little complicated. Such an application, either by the more complete
condensation of the ideas which it requires, or by its fixing the mind
on the subject more precisely and clearly, develops a crowd of remarks
which otherwise would not have been made, and it thus contributes to
facilitate the comprehension of theories in such an efficacious manner
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page15" id = "page15">15</a></span>
that the time given to the numerical work is more than regained by its
being no longer necessary to return incessantly to new explanations of
the same method.</p>

<p>The teaching of arithmetic will therefore have for its essential
object, to make the pupils acquire the habit of calculation, so that
they may be able to make an easy and continual use of it in the course
of their studies. The theory of the operations must be given to them
with clearness and precision; not only that they may understand the
mechanism of those operations, but because, in almost all questions, the
application of the methods calls for great attention and continual
discussion, if we would arrive at a result in which we can confide. But
at the same time every useless theory must be carefully removed, so as
not to distract the attention of the pupil, but to devote it entirely to
the essential objects of this instruction.</p>

<p>It may be objected that these theories are excellent exercises to
form the mind of the pupils. We answer that such an opinion may be
doubted for more than one reason, and that, in any case, exercises on
useful subjects not being wanting in the immense field embraced by
mathematics, it is quite superfluous to create, for the mere pleasure of
it, difficulties which will never have any useful application.</p>

<p>Another remark we think important. It is of no use to arrive at a
numerical result, if we cannot answer for its correctness. The teaching
of calculation should include, as an essential condition, that the
pupils should be shown how every result, deduced from a series of
arithmetical operations, may always be controlled in such a way that we
may have all desirable certainty of its correctness; so that, though a
pupil may and must often make mistakes, he may be able to discover them
himself, to correct them himself, and never to present, at last, any
other than an exact result.</p>


<p class = "break">The <i>Programme</i> given below is made very minute
to avoid the evils which resulted from the brevity of the old one. In
it, the limits of the matter required not being clearly defined, each
teacher preferred to extend them excessively, rather than to expose his
pupils to the risk of being unable to answer certain questions. The
examiners were then naturally led to put the questions thus offered to
them, so to say; and thus the preparatory studies grew into excessive
and extravagant development. These abuses could be remedied only by the
publication of programmes so detailed, that the limits within which the
branches required for admission must be restricted should be so apparent
to the eyes of all, as to render it impossible for the examiners to go
out of them, and thus to permit teachers to confine their instruction
within them.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page16" id = "page16">16</a></span>
<p>The new programme for arithmetic commences with the words Decimal
numeration. This is to indicate that the Duodecimal numeration will not
be required.</p>

<p>The only practical verification of Addition and Multiplication, is to
recommence these operations in a different order.</p>

<p>The Division of whole numbers is the first question considered at all
difficult. This difficulty arises from the complication of the methods
by which division is taught. In some books its explanation contains
twice as many reasons as is necessary. The mind becomes confused by such
instruction, and no longer understands what is a demonstration, when it
sees it continued at the moment when it appeared to be finished. In most
cases the demonstration is excessively complicated and does not follow
the same order as the practical rule, to which it is then necessary to
return. There lies the evil, and it is real and profound.</p>

<p>The phrase of the programme, Division of whole numbers, intends that
the pupil shall be required to explain the practical rule, and be able
to use it in a familiar and rapid manner. We do not present any
particular mode of demonstration, but, to explain our views, we will
indicate how we would treat the subject if we were making the detailed
programme of a <i>course</i> of arithmetic, and not merely that of an
<i>examination</i>. It would be somewhat thus:</p>

<p>“The quotient may be found by addition, subtraction,
multiplication;</p>

<p>“Division of a number by a number of one figure, when the quotient is
less than 10;</p>

<p>“Division of any number by a number less than 10;</p>

<p>“Division of any two numbers when the quotient has only one
figure;</p>

<p>“Division in the most general case.</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>“<i>Note.</i>&mdash;The practical rule may be entirely explained by
this consideration, that by multiplying the divisor by different
numbers, we see if the quotient is greater or less than the
multiplier.”</p>
</div>

<p>The properties of the Divisors of numbers, and the decomposition of a
number into prime factors should be known by the student. But here also
we recommend simplicity. The theory of the greatest common divisor, for
example, has no need to be given with all the details with which it is
usually surrounded, for it is of no use in practice.</p>

<p>The calculation of Decimal numbers is especially that in which it is
indispensable to exercise students. Such are the numbers on which they
will generally have to operate. It is rare that the data of a question
are whole numbers; usually they are decimal numbers which are not even
known with rigor, but only with a given decimal approximation; and the
result which is sought is to deduce from these, other decimal numbers,
themselves exact to a certain degree of approximation,
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page17" id = "page17">17</a></span>
fixed by the conditions of the problem. It is thus that this subject
should be taught. The pupil should not merely learn how, in one or two
cases, he can obtain a result to within 1/<i>n</i>, <i>n</i> being any
number, but how to arrive by a practicable route to results which are
exact to within a required decimal, and on the correctness of which they
can depend.</p>

<p>Let us take decimal multiplication for an example. Generally the
pupils do not know any other rule than “to multiply one factor by the
other, without noticing the decimal point, except to cut off on the
right of the product as many decimal figures as there are in the two
factors.” The rule thus enunciated is methodical, simple, and apparently
easy. But, in reality, it is practically of a repulsive length, and is
most generally inapplicable.</p>

<p>Let us suppose that we have to multiply together two numbers having
each six decimals, and that we wish to know the product also to the
sixth decimal. The above rule will give twelve decimals, the last six of
which, being useless, will have caused by their calculation the loss of
precious time. Still farther; when a factor of a product is given with
six decimals, it is because we have stopped in its determination at that
degree of approximation, neglecting the following decimals; whence it
results that several of the decimals situated on the right of the
calculated product are not those which would belong to the rigorous
product. What then is the use of taking the trouble of determining
them?</p>

<p>We will remark lastly that if the factors of the product are
incommensurable, and if it is necessary to convert them into decimals
before effecting the multiplication, we should not know how far we
should carry the approximation of the factors before applying the above
rule. It will therefore be necessary to teach the pupils the abridged
methods by which we succeed, at the same time, in using fewer figures
and in knowing the real approximation of the result at which we
arrive.</p>

<p>Periodical decimal fractions are of no use. The two elementary
questions of the programme are all that need be known about them.</p>

<p>The Extraction of the square root must be given very carefully,
especially that of decimal numbers. It is quite impossible here to
observe the rule of having in the square twice as many decimals as are
required in the root. That rule is in fact impracticable when a series
of operations is to be effected. “When a number N increases by a
comparatively small quantity <i>d</i>, the square of that number
increases very nearly as 2N<i>d</i>.” It is thus that we determine the
approximation with which a number must be calculated so that its square
root may afterwards be obtained with the necessary exactitude. This
supposes that before determining the square with all necessary
precision, we have a
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page18" id = "page18">18</a></span>
suitable lower limit of the value of the root, which can always be done
without difficulty.</p>

<p>The Cube root is included in the programme. The pupils should know
this; but while it will be necessary to exercise them on the extraction
of the square root by numerous examples, we should be very sparing of
this in the cube root, and not go far beyond the mere theory. The
calculations become too complicated and waste too much time. Logarithms
are useful even for the square root; and quite indispensable for the
cube root, and still more so for higher roots.</p>

<p>When a question contains only quantities which vary in the same
ratio, or in an inverse ratio, it is immediately resolved by a very
simple method, known under the name of <i>reduction to unity</i>. The
result once obtained, it is indispensable to make the pupils remark that
it is composed of the quantity which, among the data, is of the nature
of that which is sought, multiplied successively by a series of abstract
ratios between other quantities which also, taken two and two, are of
the same nature. Hence flows the rule for writing directly the required
result, without being obliged to take up again for each question the
series of reasonings. This has the advantage, not only of saving time,
but of better showing the spirit of the method, of making clearer the
meaning of the solution, and of preparing for the subsequent use of
formulas. The consideration of “homogeneity” conduces to these
results.</p>

<p>We recommend teachers to abandon as much as possible the use of
examples in abstract numbers, and of insignificant problems, in which
the data, taken at random, have no connection with reality. Let the
examples and the exercises presented to students always relate to
objects which are found in the arts, in industry, in nature, in physics,
in the system of the world. This will have many advantages. The precise
meaning of the solutions will be better grasped. The pupils will thus
acquire, without any trouble, a stock of precise and precious knowledge
of the world which surrounds them. They will also more willingly engage
in numerical calculations, when their attention is thus incessantly
aroused and sustained, and when the result, instead of being merely a
dry number, embodies information which is real, useful, and
interesting.</p>

<p>The former arithmetical programme included the theory of
<i>progressions</i> and <i>logarithms</i>; the latter being deduced from
the former. But the theory of logarithms is again deduced in algebra
from exponents, much the best method. This constitutes an objectionable
“<i>double emploi</i>.” There is finally no good reason for retaining
these theories in arithmetic.</p>

<p>The programme retains the questions which can be solved by making two
arbitrary and successive hypotheses on the desired result. It is true
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page19" id = "page19">19</a></span>
that these questions can be directly resolved by means of a simple
equation of the first degree; but we have considered that, since the
resolution of problems by means of hypotheses, constitutes the most
fruitful method really used in practice, it is well to accustom students
to it the soonest possible. This is the more necessary, because teachers
have generally pursued the opposite course, aiming especially to give
their pupils direct solutions, without reflecting that the theory of
these is usually much more complicated, and that the mind of the learner
thus receives a direction exactly contrary to that which it will have to
take in the end.</p>

<p>“Proportions” remain to be noticed.</p>

<p>In most arithmetics problems are resolved first by the method of
“reduction to unity,” and then by the theory of proportions. But beside
the objection of the “<i>double emploi</i>,” it is very certain that the
method of reduction to unity presents, in their true light and in a
complete and simple manner, all the questions of ratio which are the
bases of arithmetical solutions; so that the subsequent introduction of
proportions teaches nothing new to the pupils, and only presents the
same thing in a more complicated manner. We therefore exclude from our
programme of examination the solution of questions of arithmetic,
presented under the special form which constitutes the theory of
proportions.</p>

<p>This special form we would be very careful not to invent, if it had
not already been employed. Why not say simply “The ratio of M to N is
equal to that of P to Q,” instead of hunting for this other form of
enunciating the same idea, “M <i>is to</i> N <i>as</i> P <i>is to</i>
Q”? It is in vain to allege the necessities of geometry; if we consider
all the questions in which proportions are used, we shall see that the
simple consideration of the equality of ratios is equally well adapted
to the simplicity of the enunciation and the clearness of the
demonstrations. However, since all the old books of geometry make use of
proportions, we retain the properties of proportions at the end of our
programme; but with this express reserve, that the examiners shall limit
themselves to the simple properties which we indicate, and that they
shall not demand any application of proportions to the solution of
arithmetical problems.</p>

= "#poly_admit">II. GEOMETRY</a></h5>

<p>Some knowledge of Geometry is, next to arithmetic, most indispensable
to every one, and yet very few possess even its first principles. This
is the fault of the common system of instruction. We do not pay
sufficient regard to the natural notions about straight lines, angles,
parallels, circles, etc., which the young have acquired by looking
around them, and which their minds have unconsciously considered before
making them a regular study. We thus waste time in giving a dogmatic
form to truths which the mind seizes directly.</p>

<p>The illustrious <i>Clairaut</i> complains of this, and of the
instruction commencing always with a great number of definitions,
postulates, axioms, and preliminary principles, dry and repulsive, and
followed by propositions equally uninteresting. He also condemns the
profusion of self-evident propositions, saying, “It is not surprising
that Euclid should give himself the trouble to demonstrate that two
circles which intersect have not the same centre; that a triangle
situated within another has the sum of its sides smaller than that of
the sides of the triangle which contains it; and so on. That geometer
had to convince obstinate sophists, who gloried in denying the most
evident truths. It was therefore necessary that geometry, like logic,
should then have the aid of formal reasonings, to close the mouths of
cavillers; but in our day things have changed face; all reasoning about
what mere good sense decides in advance is now a pure waste of time, and
is fitted, only to obscure the truth and to disgust the reader.”</p>

<p><i>Bezout</i> also condemns the multiplication of the number of
theorems, propositions, and corollaries; an array which makes the
student dizzy, and amid which he is lost. All that follows from a
principle should be given in natural language as far as possible,
avoiding the dogmatic form. It is true that some consider the works of
Bezout deficient in rigor, but he knew better than any one what really
was a demonstration. Nor do we find in the works of the great old
masters less generality of views, less precision, less clearness of
conception than in modern treatises. Quite the contrary indeed.</p>

<p>We see this in Bezout’s <i>definition of a right line</i>&mdash;that
it tends continually towards one and the same point; and in that of <i>a
curved line</i>&mdash;that it is the trace of a moving point, which
turns aside infinitely little at each step of its progress; definitions
most fruitful in consequences. When we define a right line as the
shortest path from one point to another, we enunciate a property of that
line which is of no use for demonstrations. When we define a curved line
as one which is neither straight
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page22" id = "page22">22</a></span>
nor composed of straight lines, we enunciate two negations which can
lead to no result, and which have no connection with the peculiar nature
of the curved line. Bezout’s definition, on the contrary, enters into
the nature of the object to be defined, seizes its mode of being, its
character, and puts the reader immediately in possession of the general
idea from which are afterwards deduced the properties of curved lines
and the construction of their tangents.</p>

<p>So too when Bezout says that, in order to form an exact idea of an
angle, it is necessary to consider the movement of a line turning around
one of its points, he gives an idea at once more just and more fruitful
in consequences, both mathematical and mechanical, than that which is
limited to saying, that the indefinite space comprised between two
straight lines which meet in a point, and which may be regarded as
prolonged indefinitely, is called an <i>angle</i>; a definition not very
easily comprehended and absolutely useless for ulterior explanations,
while that of Bezout is of continual service.</p>

<p>We therefore urge teachers to return, in their demonstrations, to the
simplest ideas, which are also the most general; to consider a
demonstration as finished and complete when it has evidently caused the
truth to enter into the mind of the pupil, and to add nothing merely for
the sake of silencing sophists.</p>

<p class = "break">
Referring to our Programme of Geometry, given below, our first comments
relate to the “Theory of parallels.” This is a subject on which all
students fear to be examined; and this being a general feeling, it is
plain that it is not their fault, but that of the manner in which this
subject is taught. The omission of the natural idea of the constant
direction of the right line (as&nbsp;defined by Bezout) causes the
complication of the first elements; makes it necessary for Legendre to
demonstrate that all right angles are equal (a&nbsp;proposition whose
meaning is rarely understood); and is the real source of all the
pretended difficulties of the theory of parallels. These difficulties
are now usually avoided by the admission of a <i>postulate</i>, after
the example of Euclid, and to regulate the practice in that matter, we
have thought proper to prescribe that this proposition&mdash;<i>Through
a given point only a single parallel to a right line can be
drawn</i>&mdash;should be admitted purely and simply, without
demonstration, and as a direct consequence of our idea of the nature of
the right line.</p>

<p>We should remark that the order of ideas in our programme supposes
the properties of lines established without any use of the properties of
surfaces. We think that, in this respect, it is better to follow Lacroix
than Legendre.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page23" id = "page23">23</a></span>
<p>When we prove thus that three parallels always divide two right lines
into proportional parts, this proposition can be extended to the case in
which the ratio of the parts is incommensurable, either by the method
called <i>Reductio ad absurdum</i>, or by the method of <i>Limits</i>.
We especially recommend the use of the latter method. The former has in
fact nothing which satisfies the mind, and we should never have recourse
to it, for it is always possible to do without it. When we have proved
to the pupil that a desired quantity, X, cannot be either larger or
smaller than A, the pupil is indeed forced to admit that X and A are
equal; but that does not make him understand or feel why that equality
exists. Now those demonstrations which are of such a nature that, once
given, they disappear, as it were, so as to leave to the proposition
demonstrated the character of a truth evident <i>à priori</i>, are those
which should be carefully sought for, not only because they make that
truth better felt, but because they better prepare the mind for
conceptions of a more elevated order. The method of limits, is, for a
certain number of questions, the only one which possesses this
characteristic&mdash;that the demonstration is closely connected with
the essential nature of the proposition to be established.</p>

<p>In reference to the relations which exist between the sides of a
triangle and the segments formed by perpendiculars let fall from the
summits, we will, once for all, recommend to the teacher, to exercise
his students in making numerical applications of relations of that kind,
as often as they shall present themselves in the course of geometry.
This is the way to cause their meaning to be well understood, to fix
them in the mind of students, and to give these the exercise in
numerical calculation to which we positively require them to be
habituated.</p>

<p>The theory of similar figures has a direct application in the art of
surveying for plans (<i>Lever des plans</i>). We wish that this
application should be given to the pupils in detail; that they should be
taught to range out and measure a straight line on the ground; that a
graphometer should be placed in their hands; and that they should use it
and the chain to obtain on the ground, for themselves, all the data
necessary for the construction of a map, which they will present to the
examiners with the calculations in the margins.</p>

<p>It is true that a more complete study of this subject will have to be
subsequently made by means of trigonometry, in which calculation will
give more precision than these graphical operations. But some pupils may
fail to extend their studies to trigonometry (the course given for the
Polytechnic school having become the model for general instruction in
France), and those who do will thus learn that trigonometry merely gives
means of more precise calculation. This application will also be
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page24" id = "page24">24</a></span>
an encouragement to the study of a science whose utility the pupil will
thus begin to comprehend.</p>

<p>It is common to say that an angle is measured by the arc of a circle,
described from its summit or centre, and intercepted between its sides.
It is true that teachers add, that since a quantity cannot be measured
except by one of the same nature, and since the arc of a circle is of a
different nature from an angle, the preceding enunciation is only an
abridgment of the proposition by which we find the ratio of an angle to
a right angle. Despite this precaution, the unqualified enunciation
which precedes, causes uncertainty in the mind of the pupil, and
produces in it a lamentable confusion. We will say as much of the
following enunciations: “A&nbsp;dihedral angle is measured by the plane
angle included between its sides;” “The surface of a spherical triangle
is measured by the excess of the sum of its three angles above two right
angles,” etc.; enunciations which have no meaning in themselves, and
from which every trace of homogeneity has disappeared. Now that
everybody is requiring that the students of the Polytechnic school
should better understand the meaning of the formulas which they are
taught, which requires that their homogeneity should always be apparent,
this should be attended to from the beginning of their studies, in
geometry as well as in arithmetic. The examiners must therefore insist
that the pupils shall never give them any enunciations in which
homogeneity is not preserved.</p>

<p>The proportionality of the circumferences of circles to their radii
must be inferred <i>directly</i> from the proportionality of the
perimeters of regular polygons, of the same number of sides, to their
apothems. In like manner, from the area of a regular polygon being
measured by half of the product of its perimeter by the radius of the
inscribed circle, it must be <i>directly</i> inferred that the area of a
circle is measured by half of the product of its circumference by its
radius. For a long time, these properties of the circle were differently
demonstrated by proving, for example, with Legendre, that the measure of
the circle could not be either smaller or greater than that which we
have just given, whence it had to be inferred that it must be equal to
it. The “Council of improvement” finally decided that this method should
be abandoned, and that the method of limits should alone be admitted, in
the examinations, for demonstrations of this kind. This was a true
advance, but it was not sufficient. It did not, as it should, go on to
consider the circle, purely and simply, as the limit of a series of
regular polygons, the number of whose sides goes on increasing to
infinity, and to regard the circle as possessing every property
demonstrated for polygons. Instead of this, they inscribed and
circumscribed to the circle two polygons of the same number of sides,
and
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page25" id = "page25">25</a></span>
proved that, by the multiplication of the number of the sides of these
polygons, the difference of their areas might become smaller than any
given quantity, and thence, finally, deduced the measure of the area of
the circle; that is to say, they took away from the method of limits all
its advantage as to simplicity, by not applying it <i>frankly</i>.</p>

<p>We now ask that this shall cease; and that we shall no longer
reproach for want of rigor, the Lagranges, the Laplaces, the Poissons,
and Leibnitz, who has given us this principle: that “A&nbsp;curvilinear
figure may be regarded as equivalent to a polygon of an infinite number
of sides; whence it follows that whatsoever can be demonstrated of such
a polygon, no regard being paid to the number of its sides, the same may
be asserted of the curve.” This is the principle for <i>the most
simple</i> application of which to the measure of the circle and of the
round bodies we appeal.</p>

<p>Whatever may be the formulas which may be given to the pupils for the
determination of the ratio of the circumference to the diameter (the
“Method of isoperimeters” is to be recommended for its simplicity), they
must be required to perform the calculation, so as to obtain at least
two or three exact decimals. These calculations, made with logarithms,
must be methodically arranged and presented at the examination. It may
be known whether the candidate is really the author of the papers, by
calling for explanations on some of the steps, or making him calculate
some points afresh.</p>

<p>The enunciations relating to the measurement of areas too often leave
indistinctness in the minds of students, doubtless because of their
form. We desire to make them better comprehended, by insisting on their
application by means of a great number of examples.</p>

<p>As one application, we require the knowledge of the methods of
surveying for content (<i>arpentage</i>), differing somewhat from the
method of triangulation, used in the surveying for plans (<i>lever des
plans</i>). To make this application more fruitful, the ground should be
bounded on one side by an irregular curve. The pupils will not only thus
learn how to overcome this practical difficulty, but they will find, in
the calculation of the surface by means of trapezoids, the first
application of the method of quadratures, with which it is important
that they should very early become familiar. This application will
constitute a new sheet of drawing and calculations to be presented at
the examination.</p>

<p>Most of our remarks on plane geometry apply to geometry of three
dimensions. Care should be taken always to leave homogeneity apparent
and to make numerous applications to the measurement of volumes.</p>

<p>The theory of similar polyhedrons often gives rise in the examination
of the students to serious difficulties on their part. These
difficulties
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page26" id = "page26">26</a></span>
belong rather to the form than to the substance, and to the manner in
which each individual mind seizes relations of position; relations
always easier to feel than to express. The examiners should be content
with arriving at the results enunciated in our programme, by the
shortest and easiest road.</p>

<p>The simplicity desired cannot however be attained unless all have a
common starting-point, in the definition of similar polyhedrons. The
best course is assuredly to consider that theory in the point of view in
which it is employed in the arts, especially in sculpture; i.e. to
conceive the given system of points, M, N, P, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to
have lines passing from them through a point S, the <i>pole of
similitude</i>, and prolonged beyond it to M’, N’, P’,
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. so that SM’, SN’, SP’, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. are
proportional to SM, SN, SP, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Then the
points M’, N’, P’, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. form a system <i>similar</i>
to M, N, P, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>The areas and volumes of the cylinder, of the cone, and of the sphere
must be deduced from the areas and from the volumes of the prism, of the
pyramid, and of the polygonal sector, with the same simplicity which we
have required for the measure of the surface of the circle, and for the
same reasons. It is, besides, the only means of easily extending to
cones and cylinders with any bases whatever, right or oblique, those
properties of cones and cylinders,&mdash;right and with circular
bases,&mdash;which are applicable to them.</p>

<p>Numerical examples of the calculations, by logarithms, of these areas
and volumes, including the area of a spherical triangle, will make
another sheet to be presented to the examiners.</p>

to every one. It should be very sparingly introduced into the general
education of youth, and we would there willingly dispense with it
entirely, excepting logarithms, if this would benefit the study of
arithmetic and geometry. The programme of it which we are now to give,
considers it purely in view of its utility to engineers, and we will
carefully eliminate every thing not necessary for them.</p>

<p>Algebraical calculation presents no serious difficulty, when its
students become well impressed with this idea, that every letter
represents a number; and particularly when the consideration of negative
quantities is not brought in at the outset and in an absolute manner.
These quantities and their properties should not be introduced except as
the solution of questions by means of equations causes their necessity
to be felt, either for generalizing the rules of calculation, or for
extending the meaning of the formulas to which it leads. <span class =
"smallcaps">Clairaut</span> pursues this course. He says, “I&nbsp;treat
of the multiplication of negative quantities, that dangerous shoal for
both scholars and teachers, only after having shown its necessity to the
learner, by giving him a problem in which he has to consider negative
quantities independently of any positive quantities from which they are
subtracted. When I have arrived at that point in the problem where I
have to multiply or divide negative quantities by one another, I take
the course which was undoubtedly taken by the first analysts who have
had those operations to perform and who have wished to follow a
perfectly sure route: I&nbsp;seek for a solution of the problem which
does not involve these operations; I&nbsp;thus arrive at the result by
reasonings which admit of no doubt, and I thus see what those products
or quotients of negative quantities, which had given me the first
solution, must be.” <span class = "smallcaps">Bezout</span> proceeds in
the same way.</p>

<p>We recommend to teachers to follow these examples; not to speak to
their pupils about negative quantities till the necessity of it is felt,
and
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page32" id = "page32">32</a></span>
when they have become familiar with algebraic calculation; and above all
not to lose precious time in obscure discussions and demonstrations,
which the best theory will never teach students so well as numerous
applications.</p>

<p>It has been customary to take up again, in algebra, the calculus of
fractions, so as to generalize the explanations given in arithmetic,
since the terms of literal fractions may be any quantities whatsoever.
Rigorously, this may be well, but to save time we omit this, thinking it
better to employ this time in advancing and exercising the mind on new
truths, rather than in returning continually to rules already given, in
order to imprint a new degree of rigor on their demonstration, or to
give them an extension of which no one doubts.</p>

<p>The study of numerical equations of the first degree, with one or
several unknown quantities, must be made with great care. We have
required the solution of these equations to be made by the method of
<i>substitution</i>. We have done this, not only because this method
really comprehends the others, particularly that of <i>comparison</i>,
but for this farther reason. In treatises on algebra, those equations
alone are considered whose numerical coefficients and solutions are very
simple numbers. It then makes very little difference what method is
used, or in what order the unknown quantities are eliminated. But it is
a very different thing in practice, where the coefficients are
complicated numbers, given with decimal parts, and where the numerical
values of these coefficients may be very different in the same equation,
some being very great and some very small. In such cases the method of
<i>substitution</i> can alone be employed to advantage, and that with
the precaution of taking the value of the unknown quantity to be
eliminated from that equation in which it has relatively the greatest,
coefficient. Now the method of <i>comparison</i> is only the method of
substitution put in a form in which these precautions cannot be
observed, so that in practice it will give bad results with much
labor.</p>

<p>The candidates must present to the examiners the complete
calculations of the resolution of four equations with four unknown
quantities, made with all the precision permitted by the logarithmic
tables of Callet, and the proof that that precision has been obtained.
The coefficients must contain decimals and be very different from one
another, and the elimination must be effected with the above
precautions.</p>

<p>The teaching of the present day disregards too much the applicability
of the methods given, provided only that they be elegant in their form;
so that they have to be abandoned and changed when the pupils enter on
practice. This disdain of practical utility was not felt by our great
mathematicians, who incessantly turned their attention towards
applications.
<span class = "pagenum">

Thus the illustrious Lagrange made suggestions like those just given;
and Laplace recommended the drawing of curves for solving directly all
kinds of numerical equations.</p>

<p>As to literal equations of the first degree, we call for formulas
sufficient for the resolution of equations of two or three unknown
quantities. Bezout’s method of elimination must be given as a first
application of that fruitful method of indeterminates. The general
discussion of formulas will be confined to the case of two unknown
quantities. The discussion of three equations with three unknown
quantities, <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, and <i>z</i>, in which the terms
independent of the unknown quantities are null, will be made directly,
by this simple consideration that the system then really includes only
two unknown quantities, to wit, the ratios of <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>, for
example, to <i>z</i>.</p>

<p>The resolution of inequalities of the first degree with one or more
unknown quantities, was added to equations of the first degree some
years ago. We do not retain that addition.</p>

<p>The equations of the second degree, like the first, must be very
carefully given. In dwelling on the case where the coefficient of
<i>x</i><sup>2</sup> converges towards zero, it will be remarked that,
when the coefficient is very small, the ordinary formula would give one
of the roots by the difference of two numbers almost equal; so that
sufficient exactness could not be obtained without much labor. It must
be shown how that inconvenience may be avoided.</p>

<p>It is common to meet with expressions of which the maximum or the
minimum can be determined by the consideration of an equation of the
second degree. We retain the study of them, especially for the benefit
of those who will not have the opportunity of advancing to the general
theory of maxima and minima.</p>

<p>The theory of the algebraic calculation of imaginary quantities,
given <i>à&nbsp;priori</i>, may, on the contrary, be set aside without
inconvenience. It is enough that the pupils know that the different
powers of √<span class = "root">-1</span> continually reproduce in turn
one of these four values, ±1, ±√<span class = "root">-1</span>. We will
say as much of the calculation of the algebraic values of radicals,
which is of no use. The calculation of their <i>arithmetical</i> values
will alone be demanded. In this connection will be taught the notation
of fractional exponents and that of negative exponents.</p>

<p>The theory of numbers has taken by degrees a disproportionate
development in the examinations for admission; it is of no use in
practice, and, besides, constitutes in the pure mathematics a science
apart.</p>

<p>The theory of continued fractions at first seems more useful. It is
employed in the resolution of algebraic equations, and in that of the
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page34" id = "page34">34</a></span>
exponential equation <i>a</i><sup><i>x</i></sup>=<i>b</i>. But these
methods are entirely unsuited to practice, and we therefore omit this
theory.</p>

<p>The theory of series, on the contrary, claims some farther
developments. Series are continually met with in practice; they give the
best solutions of many questions, and it is indispensable to know in
what circumstances they can be safely employed.</p>

<p>We have so often insisted on the necessity of teaching students to
calculate, as to justify the extent of the part of the programme
relating to logarithms. We have suppressed the inapplicable method of
determining logarithms by continued fractions, and have substituted the
employment of the series which gives the logarithm of <i>n</i>+1,
knowing that of <i>n</i>. To exercise the students in the calculation of
the series, they should be made to determine the logarithms of the
numbers from 1 to 10, from 101 to 110, and from 10,000 to 10,010, the
object of these last being to show them with what rapidity the
calculation proceeds when the numbers are large; the first term of the
series is then sufficient, the variations of the logarithms being
sensibly proportional to the variations of the numbers, within the
limits of the necessary exactness. In the logarithmic calculations, the
pupils will be exercised in judging of the exactness which they may have
been able to obtain: the consideration of the numerical values of the
proportional parts given in the tables is quite sufficient for this
purpose, and is beside the only one which can be employed in
practice.</p>

<p>The use of the sliding rule, which is merely an application of
logarithms, gives a rapid and portable means of executing approximately
a great number of calculations which do not require great exactness. We
desire that the use of this little instrument should be made familiar to
the candidates. This is asked for by all the professors of the “School
of application,” particularly those of Topography, of Artillery, of
Construction, and of Applied Mechanics, who have been convinced by
experience of the utility of this instrument, which has the greatest
possible analogy with tables of logarithms.</p>

<p>Before entering on the subjects of higher algebra, it should be
remembered that the reductions of the course which we have found to be
so urgent, will be made chiefly on it. The general theory of equations
has taken in the examinations an abnormal and improper development, not
worth the time which it costs the students. We may add, that it is very
rare to meet a numerical equation of a high degree requiring to be
resolved, and that those who have to do this, take care not to seek its
roots by the methods which they have been taught. These methods moreover
are not applicable to transcendental equations, which are much more
frequently found in practice.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page35" id = "page35">35</a></span>
<p>The theory of the greatest common algebraic divisor, in its entire
generality, is of no use, even in pure science, unless in the
elimination between equations of any degree whatever. But this last
subject being omitted, the greatest common divisor is likewise dispensed
with.</p>

<p>It is usual in the general theory of algebraic equations to consider
the derived polynomials of entire functions of <i>x</i>. These
polynomials are in fact useful in several circumstances, and
particularly in the theory of equal roots; and in analytical geometry,
they serve for the discussion of curves and the determination of their
tangents. But since transcendental curves are very often encountered in
practice, we give in our programme the calculation of the derivatives of
algebraic and fractional functions, and transcendental functions,
logarithmic, exponential, and circular. This has been long called for,
not only because it must be of great assistance in the teaching of
analytical geometry, but also because it will facilitate the elementary
study of the infinitesimal calculus.</p>

<p>We have not retrenched any of the general ideas on the composition of
an entire polynomial by means of factors corresponding to its roots. We
retain several theorems rather because they contain the germs of useful
ideas than because of their practical utility, and therefore wish the
examiners to restrict themselves scrupulously to the programme.</p>

<p>The essential point in practice is to be able to determine
conveniently an incommensurable root of an algebraic or transcendental
equation, when encountered. Let us consider first an algebraic
equation.</p>

<p>All the methods which have for their object to separate the roots, or
to approximate to them, begin with the substitution of the series of
consecutive whole numbers, in the first member of the equation. The
direct substitution becomes exceedingly complicated, when the numbers
substituted become large. It may be much shortened, however, by deducing
the results from one another by means of their differences, and guarding
against any possibility of error, by verifying some of those results,
those corresponding to the numbers easiest to substitute, such as ±10,
±20.&nbsp;The teacher should not fail to explain this to his pupils.</p>

<p>Still farther: let us suppose that we have to resolve an equation of
the third degree, and that we have recognized by the preceding
calculations the necessity of substituting, between the numbers 2 and 3,
numbers differing by a tenth, either for the purpose of continuing to
effect the separation of the roots, or to approximate nearer to a root
comprised between 2 and 3.&nbsp;If we knew, for the result corresponding
to the substitution of 2, the first, second, and third differences of
the results of the new substitutions, we could thence deduce those
results themselves with as much simplicity, as in the case of the whole
numbers. The new third difference, for example, will be simply the
thousandth part of the old
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page36" id = "page36">36</a></span>
third difference. We may also remark that there is no possibility of
error, since, the numbers being deduced from one another, when we in
this way arrive at the result of the substitution of 3, which has
already been calculated, the whole work will thus be verified.</p>

<p>Let us suppose again that we have thus recognized that the equation
has a root comprised between 2.3 and 2.4; we will approximate still
nearer by substituting intermediate numbers, differing by 0.01, and
employing the course just prescribed. As soon as the third differences
can be neglected, the calculation will be finished at once, by the
consideration of an equation of the second degree; or, if it is
preferred to continue the approximations till the second differences in
their turn may be neglected, the calculation will then be finished by a
simple proportion.</p>

<p>When, in a transcendental equation <i>f</i>(X) = 0, we have
substituted in <i>f</i>(X) equidistant numbers, sufficiently near to
each other to allow the differences of the results to be neglected,
commencing with a certain order, the 4th, for example, we may, within
certain limits of <i>x</i>, replace the transcendental function by an
algebraic and entire function of <i>x</i>, and thus reduce the search
for the roots of <i>f</i>(X) = 0 to the preceding theory.</p>

<p>Whether the proposed equation be algebraic or transcendental, we can
thus, when we have obtained one root of it with a suitable degree of
exactness, continue the approximation by the method of Newton.</p>

<p>In explaining the use of trigonometrical tables, the pupil must be
able to tell with what degree of exactness an angle can be determined by
the logarithms of any of its trigonometrical lines. The consideration of
the proportional parts will be sufficient for this. It will thus be seen
that if the <i>sine</i> determines perfectly a small angle, the degree
of exactness, which may be expected from the use of that line,
diminishes as the angle increases, and becomes quite insufficient in the
neighborhood of 90 degrees. It is the reverse for the <i>cosine</i>,
which may serve very well to represent an angle near 90 degrees, while
it would be very inexact for small angles. We see, then, that in our
applications, we should distrust those formulas which give an angle by
its sine or cosine. The <i>tangent</i>
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page39" id = "page39">39</a></span>
being alone exempt from these difficulties, we should seek, as far as
possible, to resolve all questions by means of it. Thus, let us suppose
that we know the hypothenuse and one of the sides of a right-angled
triangle, the direct determination of the included angle will be given
by a cosine, which will be wanting in exactness if the hypothenuse of
the triangle does not differ much from the given side. In that case we
should begin by calculating the third side, and then use it with the
first side to determine the desired angle by means of its tangent. When
two sides of a triangle and the included angle are given, the tangent of
the half difference of the desired angles may be calculated with
advantage; but we may also separately determine the tangent of each of
them. When the three sides of a triangle are given, the best formula for
calculating an angle, and the only one never at fault, is that which
gives the tangent of half of it.</p>

<p>The surveying for plans, taught in the course of Geometry, employing
only graphical methods of calculation, did not need any more accurate
instruments than the chain and the graphometer; but now that
trigonometry furnishes more accurate methods of calculation, the
measurements on the ground require more precision. Hence the requirement
for the pupil to measure carefully a base, to use telescopes, verniers,
etc., and to make the necessary calculations, the ground being still
considered as plane. But as these slow and laborious methods can be
employed for only the principal points of the survey, the more
expeditious means of the plane-table and compass will be used for the
details.</p>

<p>In spherical trigonometry, all that will be needed in geodesy should
be learned before admission to the school, so that the subject will not
need to be again taken up. We have specially inscribed in the programme
the relations between the angles and sides of a right-angled triangle,
which must be known by the students; they are those which occur in
practice. In tracing the course to be pursued in the resolution of the
three cases of any triangles, we have indicated that which is in fact
employed in the applications, and which is the most convenient. As to
the rest, ambiguous cases never occur in practice, and therefore we
should take care not to speak of them to learners.</p>

<p>In surveying, spherical trigonometry will now allow us to consider
cases in which the signals are not all in the same plane, and to operate
on uneven ground, obtain its projection on the plane of the horizon, and
at the same time determine differences of level.</p>

<p>It may be remarked that Descriptive Geometry might supply the place
of spherical trigonometry by a graphical construction, but the degree of
exactitude of the differences of level thus obtained would be
insufficient.</p>

<p>The important property of homogeneity must be given with clearness
and simplicity.</p>

<p>The transformation of co-ordinates must receive some numerical
applications, which are indispensable to make the student clearly see
the meaning of the formulas.</p>

<p>The determination of tangents will be effected in the most general
manner by means of the derivatives of the various functions, which we
inserted in the programme of algebra. After having shown that this
determination depends on the calculation of the derivative of the
ordinate with respect to the abscissa, this will be used to simplify the
investigation of the tangent to curves of the second degree and to
curves whose equations contain transcendental functions. The discussion
of these, formerly pursued by laborious indirect methods, will now
become easy; and as curves with transcendental equations are frequently
encountered, it will be well to exercise students in their
discussion.</p>

<p>The properties of foci and of the directrices of curves of the second
degree will be established directly, for each of the three curves, by
means of the simplest equations of these curves, and without any
consideration of the analytical properties of foci, with respect to the
general equation of the second degree. With even greater reason will we
dispense with examining whether curves of higher degree have foci, a
question whose meaning even is not well defined.</p>

<p>We retained in algebra the elimination between two equations of the
second degree with two unknown quantities, a problem which corresponds
to the purely analytical investigation of the co-ordinates of the points
of intersection of two curves of the second degree. The final equation
is in general of the fourth degree, but we may sometimes dispense with
calculating that equation. A&nbsp;graphical construction of the curves,
carefully made, will in fact be sufficient to make known, approximately,
the co-ordinates of each of the points of intersection; and when we
shall have thus obtained an approximate solution, we will often be able
to give it all the numerical rigor desirable, by successive
approximations, deduced from the equations. These considerations will be
extended to the investigation of the real roots of equations of any form
whatever with one unknown quantity.</p>

<p>Analytical geometry of three dimensions was formerly entirely taught
within the Polytechnic school, none of it being reserved for the course
of admission. For some years past, however, candidates were required to
know the equations of the right line in space, the equation of the
plane, the solution of the problems which relate to it and the
transformation
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page42" id = "page42">42</a></span>
of co-ordinates. But the consideration of surfaces of the second order
was reserved for the interior teaching. We think it well to place this
also among the studies to be mastered before admission, in accordance
with the general principle now sought to be realized, of classing with
them that double instruction which does not exact a previous knowledge
of the differential calculus.</p>

<p>We have not, however, inserted here all the properties of surfaces of
the second order, but have retained only those which it is indispensable
to know and to retain. The transformation of rectilinear co-ordinates,
for example, must be executed with simplicity, and the teacher must
restrict himself to giving his pupils a succinct explanation of the
course to be pursued; this will suffice to them for the very rare cases
in which they may happen to have need of them. No questions will be
asked relating to the general considerations, which require very
complicated theoretical discussions, and especially that of the general
reduction of the equation of the second degree with three variables. We
have omitted from the problems relating to the right line and to the
plane, the determination of the shortest distance of two right
lines.</p>

<p>The properties of surfaces of the second order will be deduced from
the equations of those surfaces, taken directly in the simplest forms.
Among these properties, we place in the first rank, for their valuable
applications, those of the surfaces which can be generated by the
movement of a right line.</p>

<p>The general methods of Descriptive Geometry,&mdash;their uses in

determination of the Shadows of bodies,&mdash;constitute one of the most
fruitful branches of the applications of mathematics. The course has
always been given at the Polytechnic School with particular care,
according to the plans traced by the illustrious <i>Monge</i>, but no
part of the subject has heretofore been required for admission. The time
given to it in the school, being however complained of on all sides as
insufficient for its great extent and important applications, the
general methods of Descriptive Geometry will henceforth be retrenched
from the internal course, and be required of all candidates for
admission.</p>

<p>As to the programme itself, it is needless to say any thing, for it
was established by <i>Monge</i>, and the extent which he gave to it, as
well as the methods which he had created, have thus far been maintained.
We merely suppress the construction of the shortest distance between two
right-lines, which presents a disagreeable and useless complication.</p>

<h3><a name = "poly_prep" id = "poly_prep" href =
"#france_schools">SCHOOLS OF PREPARATION FOR THE
POLYTECHNIC&nbsp;SCHOOL</a></h3>

<p><span class = "firstword">There</span> are strictly speaking no
Junior Military Schools preparatory to the Polytechnic School, or to the
Special Military School at St. Cyr. These schools are recruited in
general from the <i>Lycées</i> and other schools for secondary
instruction, upon which they exert a most powerful influence. Until 1852
there was no special provision made in the courses of instruction in the
<i>Lycées</i> for the mathematical preparation required for admission
into the Polytechnic, and the Bachelor’s degree in science could not be
obtained without being able to meet the requirements in Latin, rhetoric,
and logic for graduation in the arts, which was necessary to the
profession of law, medicine, and theology. In consequence, young men who
prepared to be candidates for the preliminary examinations at the
Polytechnic and the St. Cyr, left the <i>Lycées</i> before graduation in
order to acquire more geometry and less literature in the private
schools, or under private tuition.</p>

<p>A new arrangement, popularly called the <i>Bifurcation</i>, was
introduced by the Decrees of the 10th of April, 1852; and has now come
into operation. The conditions demanded for the degree in science were
adapted to the requirements of the Military Schools; and in return for
this concession it is henceforth to be exacted from candidates for the
Military Schools. The diploma of arts is no longer required before the
diploma of science can be given. The instruction, which in the upper
classes of the <i>Lycées</i> had hitherto been mainly preparatory for
the former, takes henceforth at a certain point (called that of
<i>Bifurcation</i>) two different routes, conducting separately, the one
to the baccalaureate of arts, the other to that of science. The whole
system of teaching has accordingly been altered. Boys wanting to study
algebra are no longer carried through a long course of Latin;
mathematics are raised to an equality with literature; and thus military
pupils&mdash;pupils desirous of admission at the Polytechnic and St.
Cyr, may henceforth, it is hoped, obtain in the <i>Lycées</i> all the
preparation which they had latterly sought elsewhere.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page48" id = "page48">48</a></span>
<p>Under this new system the usual course for a boy seems to be the
following:&mdash;</p>

<p>He enters the <i>Lycée</i>, in the Elementary Classes; or, a little
later, in the Grammar Classes, where he learns Latin and begins Greek.
At the age of about fourteen, he is called upon to pass an examination
for admission into the Upper Division, and here, in accordance with the
new regulations, he makes his choice for mathematics or for literature,
the studies henceforth being divided, one course leading to the
bachelorship of science, the other to that of arts.</p>

<p>In either case he has before him three yearly courses, three
classes&mdash;the Third, the Second, and what is called the Rhetoric. At
the close of this, or after passing, if he pleases, another year in what
is called the Logic, he may go up for his bachelor’s degree. The boy who
wants to go to St. Cyr or the Polytechnic chooses, of course, the
mathematical division leading to the diploma he will want, that of a
bachelor of <i>science</i>. He accordingly begins algebra, goes on to
trigonometry, to conic sections, and to mechanics, and through
corresponding stages in natural philosophy, and the like. If he chooses
to spend a fourth year in the Logic, he will be chiefly employed in
going over his subjects again. He may take his bachelor’s degree at any
time after finishing his third year; and he may, if he pleases, having
taken that, remain during a fifth or even a sixth year, in the class of
Special Mathematics.</p>

<p>If he be intended for St. Cyr, he may very well leave at the end of
his year in Rhetoric, taking of course his degree. One year in the
course of Special Mathematics will be required before he can have a
chance for the Polytechnic. Usually the number of students admitted at
the latter, who have not passed more than one year in the
<i>mathematiques spéciales</i> is very small. Very probably the young
aspirant would try at the end of his first year in this class, and would
learn by practice to do better at the end of the second.</p>

competition for admission at the <i>Ecole Normale</i> or the
Polytechnic.</p>
</div>

<p>It will only be necessary to add a few sentences in explanation of
the methods pursued in the upper classes of the <i>Lycées</i>. The
classes are large&mdash;from 80 to above 100; the lessons strictly
professorial lectures, with occasional questions, as at the Polytechnic
itself. In large establishments the class is divided, and two professors
are employed, giving two parallel courses on the same subject. To
correct and fortify this general teaching, we find, corresponding to the
interrogations of the Polytechnic, what are here called conferences. The
members of the large class are examined first of all in small
detachments of five or six by their own professors once a week; and,
secondly, a matter of yet greater importance, by the professor who is
conducting the parallel course, and by professors who are engaged for
this purpose from other <i>Lycées</i> and preparatory schools, and from
among the <i>répétiteurs</i> of the Polytechnic and the Ecole Normale
themselves. It appeared by the table of the examinations of this latter
kind which had been passed by the pupils of the class of Special
Mathematics at the <i>Lycée</i> St. Louis, that the first pupil on the
list had in the interval between the opening of the school and the date
of our visit (February 16th) gone through as many as twenty-four.</p>

<p>The assistants, who bear the name of <i>répétiteurs</i> at the
<i>Lycées</i>, do not correspond in any sense to those whom we shall
hereafter notice at the Ecole Polytechnique. They are in the
<i>Lycées</i> mere superintendents in the <i>salles d’étude</i>, who
attend to order and discipline, who give some slight occasional help to
the pupils, and may be
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page50" id = "page50">50</a></span>
employed in certain cases, where the parents wish for it, in giving
private tuition to the less proficient. The system of <i>salles
d’étude</i> appears to prevail universally; the number of the pupils
placed in each probably varying greatly. At the Polytechnic we found
eight or ten pupils in each; at St. Cyr as many as 200. The number
considered most desirable at the <i>Lycée</i> of St. Louis was stated to
be thirty.</p>

<p>It thus appears that in France not only do private establishments
succeed in giving preparation for the military schools, but that even in
the first-class public schools, which educate for the learned
professions, it has been considered possible to conduct a series of
military or science classes by the side of the usual literary or arts
classes. The common upper schools are not, as they used to be, and as
with us they are, <i>Grammar</i> schools, they are also <i>Science</i>
schools. In every <i>Lycée</i> there is, so to say, a sort of elementary
polytechnic department, giving a kind of instruction which will be
useful to the future soldier, and at the same time to others, to those
who may have to do with mines, manufactures, or any description of civil
engineering. There is thus no occasion for Junior Military Schools in
France, for all the schools of this class are more or less of a military
character in their studies.</p>

<p>The conditions of admission to the examination for the degree of
Bachelor of Science are simply, sixteen years of age, and the payment of
fees amounting to about 200 fr. (10<i>l.</i>) Examinations are held
three times a year by the Faculties at Paris, Besançon, Bordeaux, Caen,
Clermont, Dijon, Grenoble, Lille, Lyons, Marseilles, Montpellier, Nancy,
Poitiers, Rennes, Strasburg, and Toulouse, and once a year at Ajaccio,
Algiers, and nineteen other towns. There is a written examination of six
hours, and a viva voce examination of an hour and a quarter. It is, of
course, only a <i>pass</i> examination, and is said to be much less
difficult than the competitive examination for admission to St.
Cyr.&mdash;<i>Report of English Commissioners</i>, 1856.</p>

FOUNDATION AND HISTORY.</a></h4>

<p><span class = "firstword">The</span> origin of the <i>Ecole
Polytechnique</i> dates from a period of disorder and distress in the
history of France which might seem alien to all intellectual pursuits,
if we did not remember that the general stimulus of a revolutionary
period often acts powerfully upon thought and education. It is, perhaps,
even more than the Institute, the chief <ins class = "correction" title
= "text has ‘scientic’">scientific</ins> creation of the first French
Revolution. It was during the government of the committee of public
safety, when Carnot, as war minister, was gradually driving back the
invading armies, and reorganizing victory out of defeat and confusion,
that the first steps were taken for its establishment. A&nbsp;law,
dating the 1st Ventose, year II., the 12th of March 1794, created a
“Commission des Travaux Publics,” charged with the duty of establishing
a regular system for carrying on public works; and this commission
ultimately founded a central school for public works, and drew up a plan
for the competitive examination of candidates for admission to the
service. It was intended at first to give a complete education for some
of the public services, but it was soon changed into a preparatory
school, to be succeeded by special schools of application. This was the
Ecole Polytechnique.</p>

<p><a name = "poly_history_necess" id = "poly_history_necess">The school
and its plan</a> were both owing to an immediate and pressing want. It
was to be partly military and partly civil. Military, as well as civil
education had been destroyed by the revolutionists. The committee of
public safety had, indeed, formed a provisional school for engineers at
Metz, to supply the immediate wants of the army on the frontier, and at
this school young men were hastily taught the elements of fortification,
and were sent direct to the troops, to learn as they best could, the
practice of their art. “But such a method,” says the report accompanying
the law which founded the school, “does not form engineers <i>in any
true sense of the term</i>, and can only be justified by the emergency
of the
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page56" id = "page56">56</a></span>
time. The young men should be recalled to the new school to complete
their studies.” Indeed no one knew better than Carnot, to use the
language of the report, “that patriotism and courage can not <ins class
= "correction" title = "text has superfluous open quote">always</ins>
supply the want of knowledge;” and in the critical campaigns of
1793&ndash;4, he must often have felt the need of the institution which
he was then contributing to set on foot. Such was the immediate motive
for the creation of this school. At first, it only included the
engineers amongst its pupils. But the artillery were added within a
year.</p>

<p>We must not, however, omit to notice its civil character, the
combination of which with its military object forms its peculiar
feature, and has greatly contributed to its reputation. Amongst its
founders were men, who though ardent revolutionists, were thirsting for
the restoration of schools and learning, which for a time had been
totally extinguished. The chief of these, besides Carnot, were Monge and
Fourcroy, Berthollet and Lagrange. Of Carnot and Lagrange, one amongst
the first of war ministers, the other one of the greatest of
mathematicians, we need not say more. Berthollet, a man of science and
practical skill, first suggested the school; Monge, the founder of
Descriptive Geometry, a favorite <i>savant</i> of Napoleon though a
zealous republican, united to real genius that passion for teaching and
for his pupils, which makes the <i>beau idéal</i> of the founder of a
school; and Fourcroy was a man of equal practical tact and science, who
at the time had great influence with the convention, and was afterwards
intrusted by Napoleon with much of the reorganization of education in
France.</p>

<p>When the school first started there was scarcely another of any
description in the country. For nearly three years the revolution had
destroyed every kind of teaching. The attack upon the old schools, in
France, as elsewhere, chiefly in the hands of the clergy, had been begun
by a famous report of Talleyrand’s, presented to the legislative
assembly in 1791, which recommended to suppress all the existing
academies within Paris and the provinces, and to replace them by an
entirely new system of national education through the country. In this
plan a considerable number of military schools were proposed, where boys
were to be educated from a very early age. When the violent
revolutionists were in power, they adopted the destructive part of
Talleyrand’s suggestions without the other. All schools, from the
university downwards, were destroyed; the large exhibitions or
<i>Bourses</i>, numbering nearly 40,000, were confiscated or plundered
by individuals, and even the military schools and those for the public
works (which were absolutely
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page57" id = "page57">57</a></span>
necessary for the very roads and the defense of the country) were
suppressed or disorganized. The school of engineers at Mézières
(an&nbsp;excellent one, where Monge had been a professor,) and that of
the artillery at La Fère, were both broken up, whilst the murder of
Lavoisier, and the well known saying in respect to it, that “the
Republic had no need of chemists,” gave currency to a belief, which
Fourcroy expressed in proposing the Polytechnic, “that the late
conspirators had formed a deliberate plan to destroy the arts and
sciences, and to establish their tyranny on the ruins of human
reason.”</p>

<p>Thus it was on the ruin of all the old teaching, that the new
institution was erected; a truly <i>revolutionary</i> school, as its
founders delighted to call it, using the term as it was then commonly
used, as a synonym for all that was excellent. And then for the first
time avowing the principle of public competition, its founders, Monge
and Fourcroy, began their work with an energy and enthusiasm which they
seem to have left as a traditional inheritance to their school. It is
curious to see the difficulties which the bankruptcy of the country
threw in their way, and the vigor with which, assisted by the summary
powers of the republican government, they overcame them. They begged the
old Palais Bourbon for their building; were supplied with pictures from
the Louvre; the fortunate capture of an English ship gave them some
uncut diamonds for their first experiments; presents of military
instruments were sent from the arsenals of Havre; and even the hospitals
contributed some chemical substances. In fine, having set their school
in motion, the government and its professors worked at it with such zeal
and effect, that within five months after their project was announced,
they had held their first entrance examination, open to the competition
of all France, and started with three hundred and seventy-nine
pupils.</p>

<p>The account of one of these first pupils, who is among the most
distinguished still surviving ornaments of the Polytechnic, will convey
a far better idea of the spirit of the young institution than could be
given by a more lengthy description. M.&nbsp;Biot described to us
vividly the zeal of the earliest teachers, and the thirst for knowledge
which, repressed for awhile by the horrors of the period, burst forth
with fresh ardor amongst the French youth of the time. Many of them, he
said, like himself, had been carried away by the enthusiasm of the
revolution, and had entered the army. “My father had sent me,” he added,
“to a mercantile house, and indeed I never felt any great vocation to be
a soldier, but <i>Que voulez vous?
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page58" id = "page58">58</a></span>
les Prussiens etaient en Champagne.</i>” He joined the army, served two
years under Dumouriez, and returned to Paris in the reign of terror,
<ins class = "correction" title = "quotation mark in original">“to</ins>
see from his lodgings in the Rue St. Honore the very generals who had
led us to victory, Custine and Biron, carried by in the carts to the
guillotine. “Imagine what it was when we heard that Robespierre was
dead, and that we might return safely to study after all this misery,
and then to have for our teachers La Place, Lagrange, and Monge. We felt
like men brought to life again after suffocation. Lagrange said,
modestly, “Let me teach them arithmetic.” Monge was more like our father
than our teacher; he would come to us in the evening, and assist us in
our work till midnight, and when he explained a difficulty to one of our
<i>chefs de brigade</i>, it ran like an electric spark through the
party.” The pupils were not then, he told us, as they have since been,
shut up in barracks, they were left free, but there was no idleness or
dissipation amongst them. They were united in zealous work and in good
<i>camaraderie</i>, and any one known as a bad character was avoided.
This account may be a little tinged by enthusiastic recollections, but
it agreed almost entirely with that of M. de Barante, who bore similar
testimony to the early devotion of the pupils, and the unique excellence
of the teaching of Monge.</p>

<p>We are not, however, writing a history of this school, and must
confine ourselves to such points as directly illustrate its system of
teaching and its organization. These may be roughly enumerated in the
following order:</p>

<p>1. Its early history is completed by the law of its organization,
given it by La Place in his short ministry of the interior. This
occurred in the last month of 1799, a memorable era in French history,
for it was immediately after the revolution of the 18th of Brumaire,
when Napoleon overthrew the Directory and made himself First Consul. One
of his earliest acts was to sign the charter of his great civil and
military school. This charter or decree deserves some attention, because
it is always referred to as the law of the foundation of the school. It
determined the composition of the two councils of instruction and
improvement, the bodies to which the direction of the school was to be,
and still is, intrusted; some of its marked peculiarities in the mode
and subject of teaching. It is important to notice each of the two
points.</p>

<p><a name = "poly_history_ability" id = "poly_history_ability">The
direction of the school</a> was at first almost entirely in the hands of
its professors, who formed what is still called its Council of
Instruction. Each of them presided over the school alternately for one
month, a plan copied from the revolutionary government of
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page59" id = "page59">59</a></span>
the Convention. In the course of a few years, however, another body was
added, which has now the real management of the school. This is called
the “Council of Improvement” (<i>Conseil de perfectionnement</i>,) and a
part of its business is to see that the studies form a good preparation
for those of the more special schools (<i>écoles d’application</i>) for
the civil and military service. It consists of eminent men belonging to
the various public departments supplied by the school, and some of the
professors. It has had, as far as we could judge, an useful influence;
<i>first</i>, as a body not liable to be prejudiced in its proposals by
the feelings of the school, and yet interested in its welfare and
understanding it; <i>secondly</i>, as having shown much skill in the
difficult task of making the theoretical teaching of the Polytechnic a
good introduction to the practical studies of the public service;
<i>thirdly</i>, as being sufficiently influential, from the character of
its members, to shield the school from occasional ill-judged
interference. It should be added that hardly any year has passed without
the Council making a full report on the studies of the school, with
particular reference to their bearing on the Special Schools of
Application.</p>

<p><a name = "poly_history_method" id = "poly_history_method">The method
of scientific teaching</a> has been peculiar from the beginning. It is
the most energetic form of what may be called the <a name =
"poly_history_repet" id = "poly_history_repet"><i>repetitorial</i></a>
system, a method of teaching almost peculiar to France, and which may be
described as a very able combination of professional and tutorial
teaching. The object of the <i>répétiteur</i>, or private tutor, is to
second every lecture of the professor, to explain and fix it by ocular
demonstration, explanations, or examination. This was a peculiarity in
the scheme of Monge and Foureroy. The latter said, in the first
programme, “Our pupils must not only learn, they must at once carry out
their theory. We must distribute them into small rooms, where they shall
practice the plans of descriptive geometry, which the professors have
just shown them in their public lectures. And in the same manner they
must go over in practice (<i>répéteront</i>) in separate laboratories
the principal operations of chemistry.” To carry out this system the
twenty best pupils, of whom M. Biot was one, were selected as
<i>répétiteurs</i> soon after the school had started. Since then the
vacancies have always been filled by young but competent men, aspiring
themselves to become in turn professors. They form a class of teachers
more like the highest style of private tutors in our universities, or
what are called in Germany <i>Privat-docenten</i>, than any other
body&mdash;with this difference, that they do not give their own
lectures, but breaking up the professor’s large class into small classes
of five and six pupils, examine
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page60" id = "page60">60</a></span>
these in <i>his</i> lecture. The success of this attempt we shall
describe hereafter.</p>

<p>2. A change may be noticed which was effected very early by the
Council of Improvement&mdash;the union of pupils for artillery and
engineers in a single school of application. The first report in
December 1800, speaks of the identity in extent and character of the
studies required for these two services; and in conformity with its
recommendation, the law of the 3rd of October 1802, (12th
Vendémiaire,&nbsp;XI.) dissolved the separate artillery school at
Châlons, and established the united school for both arms in the form
which it still retains at Metz.</p>

<p><a name = "poly_history_barrack" id = "poly_history_barrack">3.</a>
In 1805 a curious change was made, and one very characteristic of the
school. The pupils have always been somewhat turbulent, and generally on
the side of opposition. In the earliest times they were constantly
charged with <i>incivisme</i>, and the aristocracy was said to have
“taken refuge within its walls.” In fact, one of its earliest and of its
few great <i>literary</i> pupils, M. de Barante, confirmed this
statement, adding, as a reason, that the school gave for a while the
only good instruction in France. It was in consequence of some of these
changes that the pupils who had hitherto lived in their own private
houses or lodgings in Paris, were collected in the school building. This
“<i>casernement</i>” said to be immediately owing to a burst of anger of
Napoleon, naturally tended to give the school a more military character;
but it was regarded as an unfortunate change by its chief scientific
friends. “<i>Ah! ma pauvre école!</i>” M. Biot told us he had exclaimed,
when he saw their knapsacks on their beds. He felt, he said, that the
enthusiasm of free study was gone, and that now they would chiefly work
by routine and compulsion.</p>

<p><a name = "poly_history_1809" id = "poly_history_1809">4.</a> The
year 1809 may be called the epoch at which the school attained its final
character. By this time the functions, both of boards and teachers, were
accurately fixed, some alterations in the studies had taken place, and
the plan of a final examination had been drawn up, according to which
the pupils were to obtain their choice of the branch of the public
service they preferred. In fact, the school may be said to have
preserved ever since the form it then assumed, under a variety of
governments and through various revolutions, in most of which, indeed,
its pupils have borne some share; and one of which, the restoration of
1816, was attended with its temporary dissolution.</p>

<p>Thus, during the first years after its foundation the Polytechnic
grew and flourished in the general dearth of public teaching, being
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page61" id = "page61">61</a></span>
indeed not merely the only great school, but, until the Institute was
founded, the only scientific body in France. Working on its first idea
of high professorial lectures, practically applied and explained by
<i>répétiteurs</i>, its success in its own purely scientific line was,
and has continued to be, astonishing. Out of its sixteen earliest
professors, ten still retain an European name. Lagrange, Monge,
Fourcroy, La Place, Guyton de Morveau were connected with it. Malus,
Hauy, Biot, Poisson, and De Barante, were among its earliest pupils.
Arago, Cauchy, Cavaignac, Lamoricière, with many more modern names, came
later. All the great engineers and artillerymen of the empire belonged
to it, and the long pages in its calendar of distinguished men are the
measure of its influence on the civil and military services of France.
In fact its pupils, at a time of enormous demands, supplied all the
scientific offices of the army, and directed all the chief public works,
fortresses, arsenals, the improvement of cities, the great lines of
roads, shipbuilding, mining&mdash;carried out, in a word, most of the
great improvements of Napoleon. He knew the value of his school, “the
hen” as he called it, “that laid him golden eggs”&mdash;and perhaps its
young pupils were not improved by the excessive official patronage
bestowed by him upon “the envy of Europe,” “the first school in the
world.” It can not, however, be matter of surprise, that its vigor and
success should have caused Frenchmen, even those who criticise its
influence severely, to regard it with pride as an institution unrivaled
for scientific purposes.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to give any detailed account of the later history
of the school, but we must remark that disputes have frequently arisen
with regard to the best mode of harmonizing its teaching with that of
the special schools of application to which it conducts. These disputes
have been no doubt increased by the union of a civil and military object
in the same school. The scientific teaching desirable for some of the
higher civil professions has appeared of doubtful advantage to those
destined for the more practical work of war. There has been always a
desire on the one side to qualify pure mathematics by application, a
strong feeling on the other that mathematical study sharpens the mind
most keenly for some of the practical pursuits of after life. We should
add, perhaps, that there has been some protest in France (though little
heard among the scientific men who have been the chief directors of the
school) against the <i>esprit faux</i>, the exclusive pursuit of
mathematics to the utter neglect of literature, and the indifference to
moral and historical studies. Some one or other of these complaints
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page62" id = "page62">62</a></span>
any one who studies the <i>literature</i>, the pamphlets, and history of
the school will find often reproduced in the letters of war ministers,
of artillery and engineer officers commanding the school of application
at Metz, or of committees from the similar schools for the mines and the
roads and bridges. The last of these occasions illustrates the present
position of the school.</p>

<p><a name = "poly_history_1850" id = "poly_history_1850">On the 5th of
June 1850</a>, the legislative assembly appointed a mixed commission of
military men and civilians, who were charged to revise all the programs
of instruction, and to recommend all needful changes in the studies of
the pupils, both those preparatory to entrance<a class = "tag" name =
"tag1_9" id = "tag1_9" href = "#note1_9">9</a> and those actually
pursued in the school. The commission was composed as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>M. Thenard, Member of the Academy of Sciences, and of the Board of
Improvement of the Polytechnic School, President.</p>

<p>Le Verrier, Member of the Academy of Sciences and of the Legislative

Metiers</i>.</p>

<p>Debacq, Secretary for Military Schools at the Ministry of War,
Secretary.</p>
</div>

<p>A chronic dispute which has gone on from the very first year of the
school’s existence, between the exclusive study of abstract mathematics
on the one hand, and their early practical application on the other, was
brought to a head (though it has scarcely been set at rest) by this
commission. All the alterations effected have been in the direction of
eliminating a portion of the pure mathematics, and of reducing abstract
study to the limits within which it was believed to be most directly
applicable to practice. The results, however, are still a subject of
vehement dispute, in which most of the old scientific pupils of the
Polytechnic, and many of what may be styled its most practical members,
the officers of the artillery and engineers, are ranged on the side of
“early and deep scientific study <i>versus</i> early practical
applications.” It is, indeed, a question which touches the military
pupils nearly, since it is in their case particularly that the proposed
abstract studies of the Polytechnic might be thought of the most
doubtful advantage. We do not try to solve the problem here, though the
facts elsewhere stated will afford some materials for judgment. We
incline to the opinion
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page63" id = "page63">63</a></span>
of those who think that the ancient <i>genius loci</i>, the traditional
teaching of the school, will be too strong for legislative interference,
and that, in spite of recent enactments, abstract science and analysis
will reign in the lecture-rooms and halls of study of the Polytechnic,
now as in the days of Monge.</p>


<h4><a name = "poly_manage" id = "poly_manage" href = "#poly_start">II.
AN OUTLINE OF THE MANAGEMENT AND OF THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE SCHOOL,
ETC.</a></h4>

<p>The Polytechnic, as we have said, is a preparatory and general
scientific school; its studies are not exclusively adapted for any one
of the departments to which at the close of its course the scholars will
find themselves assigned; and on quitting it they have, before entering
on the actual discharge of their duties of whatever kind, to pass
through a further term of teaching in some one of the schools of
application specially devoted to particular professions.</p>

<p><a name = "poly_manage_service" id = "poly_manage_service">The public
services</a> for which it thus gives a general preparation are the
following:</p>

<div class = "in-one">

<p>The Telegraph Department (<i>Lignes Télégraphiques</i>.)</p>

<p class = "heading"><i>Under the minister of Finance.</i></p>
<p>The Tobacco Department (<i>Administration des Tabacs</i>.)</p>
</div>

<p>To these may be added at any time, by a decree on the part of the
government, any other departments, the duties of which appear to require
an extensive knowledge of mathematics, physics, or chemistry.</p>

<p><a name = "poly_manage_admit" id = "poly_manage_admit">Admission to
the school</a> is, and has been since its first commencement in 1794,
obtained by competition in a general examination, held yearly, and open
to all. Every French youth, between the age of sixteen and twenty,
(or&nbsp;if in the army up to the age of twenty-five,) may offer himself
as a candidate.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page64" id = "page64">64</a></span>
<p>A board of examiners passes through France once every year, and
examines all who present themselves, that have complied with the
conditions, which are fully detailed in the decree given in the
appendix. It commences at Paris.</p>

<p>A list of such of the candidates as are found eligible for admittance
to the Polytechnic is drawn up from the proceedings of the board, and
submitted to the minister at war; the number of places likely to be
vacant has already been determined, and the minister fixes the number of
admissions accordingly. The candidates admitted are invariably taken in
the order of merit.</p>

<p><a name = "poly_manage_charge" id = "poly_manage_charge">The annual
charge</a> for board and instruction is 40<i>l.</i> (1,000&nbsp;fr.,)

"poly_manage_bourse" id = "poly_manage_bourse">Exhibitions</a>, however,
for the discharge of the whole or of one-half of the expense
(<i>bourses</i> and <i>demi-bourses</i>,) are awarded by the state in
favor of <i>all</i> the successful candidates, whose parents can prove
themselves to be too poor to maintain their children in the school.
Outfits and half outfits (<i>trousseaux</i>) and <i>demi-trousseaux</i>)
are also granted in these cases, on the entrance of the student into the
school; and the number of these <i>boursiers</i> and
<i>demi-boursiers</i> amounts at the present time to one-third of the
whole.</p>

<p><a name = "poly_manage_length" id = "poly_manage_length">The course
of study is completed in two years.</a> On its successful termination
which is preceded by a final examination, the students are distributed
into the different services, the choice being offered them in the order
of their merit, and laid down in the classified list drawn up after the
examination. If it so happen that the number of places or the services
which can be offered is not sufficient for the number of qualified
students, those at the bottom of the list are offered service in the
infantry or cavalry, and those who do not enter the public service, are
supplied with certificates of having passed successfully through the
school. Students who have been admitted into the school from the army,
are <ins class = "correction" title = "text has ‘abliged’">obliged</ins>
to re-enter the army.</p>

<p>All others, as has been said, have the right of choosing, according
to their position on the list, the service which they prefer, so far,
that is, as the number of vacancies in that service will allow; or they
may if they please decline to enter the public service at all.</p>

<p>Such is a general outline of the plan and object of the school. We
may add that, besides its military staff, it employs no less than
thirty-nine professors and teachers; that it has four boards of
management, and that ten scientific men unconnected with the school, and
amongst the most distinguished in France, conduct its examinations.

<p>Prior to the examination, each candidate is called upon to give in
certain written sheets containing calculations, sketches, plans and
drawings, executed by him at school during the year, certified and dated
by the professor under whom he has studied. Care is taken to ascertain
whether these are the pupils’ own work, and any deception in this
matter, if discovered, excludes at once from the competition of the
school.</p>

done</a>, the candidates are required to reply in writing to written or

about twenty-four hours during three and a half separate days, as shown
in the following table. It usually takes place in the presence of
certain official authorities, the examiners not being present.</p>

<h4><a name = "poly_buildings" id = "poly_buildings" href =
"#poly_start">IV. THE SCHOOL BUILDINGS AND THE COURSE AND METHOD OF
STUDY.</a></h4>

<p>A brief description of the buildings may be a suitable introduction
to an account of the studies that are pursued, and the life that is <ins
class = "correction" title = "text has ‘lead’">led</ins> in them.</p>

<p><a name = "poly_buildings_situat" id = "poly_buildings_situat">The
Polytechnic School</a> stands near the Pantheon, and consists of two
main buildings, one for the official rooms and the residence of the
commandant and director of studies, the other, and larger one, for the
pupils. Detached buildings contain the chemical lecture room and
laboratory, the laboratory of natural philosophy, the library, fencing
and billiard rooms.</p>

<p>The basement floor of the larger building contains the kitchen and
refectories. On the first floor, are the two amphitheaters or great
lecture rooms, assigned respectively to the pupils of the two years or
divisions, in which the ordinary lectures are given. The rooms are large
and well arranged; the seats fixed, the students’ names attached to
them. The students are admitted by doors behind the upper tier of seats;
at the foot of all is a platform for the professor, with a blackboard
facing his audience, and with sufficient room for a pupil to stand and
work questions beside him. Room also is provided for one of the
captains, inspectors of studies, whose duty it is to be present, for the
director of studies, whose occasional presence is expected, and for the
assistant teachers or <i>répétiteurs</i>, who in the first year of their
appointment are called upon to attend the course upon which they will
have to give their subsequent questions and explanations. On this floor
are also the museums, or repositories of models, instruments, machines,
&amp;c., needed for use in the amphitheaters, or elsewhere. The museum
provided for the lecturer on Physics (or&nbsp;Natural Philosophy)
appeared in particular to be well supplied.</p>

<p>The whole of the second floor is taken up with what are called the
<i>salles d’interrogation</i>, a long series of small cabinets or
studies,
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page71" id = "page71">71</a></span>
plainly furnished with six or eight stools and a table, devoted to the
<i>interrogations particulières</i>, which will presently be
described.</p>

<p>The third floor contains the halls of study, <i>salles d’étude</i>,
or studying rooms, in which the greater part of the student’s time
during the day is passed&mdash;where he studies, draws, keeps his papers
and instruments, writes his exercises, and prepares his lectures. These
are small chambers, containing eight or, exceptionally, eleven
occupants. A double desk runs down the middle from the window to the
door, with a little shelf and drawers for each student. There is a
blackboard for the common use, and various objects are furnished through
the senior student, the sergeant, a selected pupil, more advanced than
the rest, who is placed in charge of the room, and is responsible for
whatever is handed in for the use of the students. He collects the
exercises, and generally gives a great deal of assistance to the less
proficient. “When I was sergeant,” said an old pupil, “I&nbsp;was always
at the board.” The spirit of <i>camaraderie</i>, said to exist so
strongly among the Polytechnic students, displays itself in this
particular form very beneficially. Young men of all classes work
heartily and zealously <ins class = "correction"
title = "text has ‘togethen’">together</ins> in the <i>salles d’étude</i>, and no feeling
of rivalry prevents them from assisting one another. The sergeant does
not, however, appear to exercise any authority in the way of keeping
discipline.</p>

<p>These chambers for study are arranged on each side of a long corridor
which runs through the whole length of the building, those of the
juniors being separated from those of the seniors by a central chamber
or compartment, the <i>cabinet de service</i>, where the officers
charged with the discipline are posted, and from hence pass up and down
the corridor, looking in through the glass doors and seeing that no
interruption to order takes place.</p>

<p>The fourth story is that of the dormitories, airy rooms, with twelve
beds in each. These rooms are arranged as below, along the two sides of
a corridor, and divided in the same manner into the senior and junior
side. A&nbsp;non-commissioned officer is lodged at each end of the
corridor to see that order is kept.</p>

<p>Such is the building into which at the beginning of November the
successful candidates from the <i>Lycées</i> and the <i>Ecoles
préparatoires</i> are introduced, in age resembling the pupils whom the
highest classes of English public schools send annually to the
universities, and in number equal perhaps to the new under-graduates at
one of the largest colleges at Cambridge. There is not, however, in
other points much that is common, least of all in the methods
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page72" id = "page72">72</a></span>
and habits of study we are about to describe. This will be best
understood by a summary of a day’s work.</p>

<p><a name = "poly_buildings_routine" id = "poly_buildings_routine">The
students are summoned</a> to rise at half-past five, have to answer the
roll-call at six, from six to eight are to occupy themselves in study,
and at eight they go to breakfast. On any morning except Wednesday, at
half-past eight, we should find the whole of the new admission assembled
in an amphitheater, permanent seats in which are assigned to them by
lot, and thus placed they receive a lecture from a professor, rough
notes of which they are expected to take while it goes on. The first
half hour of the hour and a half assigned to each lecture is occupied
with questions put by the professor relating to the previous lecture.
A&nbsp;name is drawn by lot, the student on whom the lot falls is called
up to the blackboard at which the professor stands, and is required to
work a problem and answer questions. The lecture concluded, the pupils
are conducted to the <i>salles d’étude</i>, which have just been
described, where they are to study. Here for one hour they devote
themselves to completing and writing out in full the notes of the
lecture they have just heard. The professor and his assistants, the
<i>répétiteurs</i>, are expected to follow and make a circuit through
the corridors, to give an opportunity to ask for information on any
difficult points in the lecture. A&nbsp;lithographed summary of the
substance of the lecture, extending perhaps to two octavo pages, is also
furnished to each studying room for the use of its pupils.</p>

<p>The lecture, as we have said, commences at half-past eight o’clock;
it lasts an hour and a half; the hour of writing up the notes brings us
to eleven. The young men are now relieved by a change of occupation, and
employ themselves (still in their places in the rooms of study) at
drawing. A&nbsp;certain number, detached from the rest, are sent to the
physical and chemical laboratories. The rotation is such as to admit
each student once a month to two or three hours’ work at a furnace for
chemistry, and once in two months to make experiments in electricity, or
other similar subjects. In this way, either at their drawing or in the
laboratories, they spend three hours, and at two o’clock go to their
dinner in the refectories below, and after dinner are free to amuse
themselves in the court-yard, the library, the fencing and the billiard
rooms, till five. At five they return to the studying rooms, and for two
hours, on Mondays and Fridays, they may employ themselves on any work
they please (<i>étude libre</i>;) on Tuesday there is a lecture in
French literature, and on Thursday in German; at seven o’clock they
commence a lesson, which lasts till nine, in landscape and figure
drawing, or they
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page73" id = "page73">73</a></span>
do exercises in French writing or in German; at nine they go down to
supper; at half-past nine they have to answer to a roll-call in their
bedrooms, and at ten all the lights are put out.</p>

<p>Wednesday is a half-holiday, and the pupils are allowed to leave the
school after two o’clock, and be absent till ten at night. The morning
is occupied either in study, at the pleasure of the students, or in set
exercises till eleven, when there is a lecture of one hour and a half,
followed, as usual, by an hour of special study on the subject of the
lecture. On Sunday they are allowed to be absent almost the whole day
till ten P.M. There is no chapel, and apparently no common religious
observance of any kind in the school.</p>

<p>Such is a general sketch of the ordinary employment of the day; a
couple of hours of preparatory study before breakfast, a lecture on the
differential calculus, on descriptive geometry, on chemistry, or natural
philosophy, followed by an hour’s work at notes; scientific drawing till
dinner; recreation; and general study, or some lighter lecture in the
evening. Were we merely to count the hours, we should find a result of
eleven or eleven and a half hours of work for every day but Wednesday,
and of seven and a half hours for that day. It is to be presumed,
however, that though absolute idleness, sleeping, or reading any book
not authorized for purposes of study, is strictly prohibited, and when
detected, punished, nevertheless the strain on the attention during the
hours of drawing and the lectures of the evening is by no means extreme.
Landscape and figure drawing, the lecture in French literature, and
probably that in German, may fairly be regarded as something like
recreation. Such, at least, was the account given us of the lectures on
literary subjects, and it agrees with the indifference to literature
which marks the school. Of wholesome out-of-door recreation, there
certainly seems to be a considerable want. There is nothing either of
the English love of games, or of the skillful athletic gymnastics of the
German schools.</p>

<p><a name = "poly_buildings_method" id = "poly_buildings_method">The
method of teaching</a> is peculiar. The plan by which a vast number of
students are collected as auditors of professorial lectures is one
pursued in many academical institutions, at the Scotch universities, and
in Germany. Large classes attend the lectures in Greek, in Latin, and in
mathematics at Glasgow; they listen to the professor’s explanations,
take notes, are occasionally questioned, and do all the harder work in
their private lodgings. Such a system of course deserves in the fullest
sense the epithet of voluntary; a diligent student may make much of it;
but there is nothing to compel an idle one to give any attention.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page74" id = "page74">74</a></span>
<p>It seems to have been one especial object pursued in the Polytechnic
to give to this plan of instruction, so lax in itself, the utmost
possible stringency, and to accumulate upon it every attainable
subsidiary appliance, every available safeguard against idleness.
Questions are expressly put <i>vivâ voce</i> by the professor before his
lecture; there is a subsequent hour of study devoted to the subject;
there is the opportunity for explanation to individual students; the
exaction of notes written out in full form; the professor also gives
exercises to the students to write during their hours of general study,
which he examines, and marks; general vivâ voce examinations
(<i>interrogations générales</i>,) conducted by the professors and
<i>répétiteurs</i>, follow the termination of each course of lectures;
and lastly, one of the most important and peculiar parts of the method,
we have what are called the <i>interrogations particulières</i>. After
every five or six lectures in each subject, each student is called up
for special questioning by one of the <i>répétiteurs</i>. The rooms in
which these continual examinations are held have been described. They
occupy one entire story of the building; each holds about six or eight
pupils, with the <i>répétiteurs</i>. Every evening, except Wednesday,
they are filled with these little classes, and busy with these close and
personal questionings. A&nbsp;brief notice, at the utmost of twenty-four
hours, is served upon the students who are thus to be called up.
Generally, after they have had a certain number of lectures, they may
expect that their time is at hand, but the precise hour of the summons
can not be counted upon. The scheme is continually varied, and it
defies, we are told, the efforts of the ablest young analysts to detect
the law which it follows.</p>

<p>It will be seen at once that such a system, where, though nominally
professorial, so little is left to the student’s own voluntary action,
where the ordinary study and <i>reading</i>, as it is called in our
English universities (here such an expression is unknown) is subjected
to such unceasing superintendence and surveillance, and to so much
careful assistance, requires an immense staff of teachers. At the
Polytechnic, for a maximum of 350 pupils, a body of fifteen professors
and twenty-four <i>répétiteurs</i>, are employed, all solely in actual
instruction, and in no way burdened with any part of the charge of the
discipline or the finance, or even with the great yearly examinations
for the passage from the first to the second division, and for the
entrance to the public services.</p>

<p>With a provision of one instructor to every eight students, it is
probable that in England we should avoid any system of large classes,
from the fear of the inferior pupils being unable to keep
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page75" id = "page75">75</a></span>
pace with the more advanced. We should have numerous small classes, and
should endeavor, above all things, to obtain the advantage of equality
of attainment in the pupils composing them.</p>

<p>The French, on the other hand, make it their first object to secure
one able principal teacher in each subject, a professor whom they burden
with very few lectures. And to meet the educational difficulty thus
created, to keep the whole large class of listeners up to the prescribed
point, they call in this numerous and busily employed corps of
assistants to <i>repeat</i>, to go over the professor’s work afresh, to
whip in, as it were, the stragglers and hurry up the loiterers.
Certainly, one would think, a difficult task with a class of 170
freshmen in such work as the integral and differential calculus. It is
one, however, in which they are aided by a stimulus which evidently acts
most powerfully on the students of the Polytechnic School. During the
two years of their stay, the prospect of their final admission to the
public services can rarely be absent from the thoughts even of the least
energetic and forethinking of the young men. Upon their place in the
last class list will depend their fortune for life. A&nbsp;high position
will secure them not only reputation, but the certainty of lucrative
employment; will put it in their power to select which service they
please, and in whichever they choose will secure them favorable notice.
Let it be remembered that fifty-three of these one hundred and seventy
are free scholars, born of parents too poor to pay 40<i>l.</i> a year
for their instruction; to whom industry must be at all times a
necessity, and industry during their two years at the Polytechnic the
best conceivable expenditure, the most certainly remunerative investment
of their pains and labor. The place on the final class list is obviously
the prize for which this race of two years’ length has to be run. What
is it determines that place? Not by any means a final struggle before
the winning-post, but steady effort and diligence from first to last
throughout the course. For the order of the class list is not solely
determined by success in the examination after which it is drawn up, but
by the result of previous trials and previous work during the whole stay
at the school.</p>

<p><a name = "poly_buildings_credit" id = "poly_buildings_credit">For,
during the whole time</a>, every written exercise set by the professor,
every drawing, the result of every <i>interrogation particulière</i> by
the <i>répétiteurs</i>, and of each general interrogation by the
professors and <i>répétiteurs</i>, is carefully marked, and a credit
placed according to the name of the student and reserved for his
benefit, in the last general account. The marks obtained in the
examination which closes the first year of study form a large element
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page76" id = "page76">76</a></span>
in this last calculation. It had been found that the work of the first
year was often neglected: the evil was quickly remedied by this
expedient. The student, it would seem, must feel that he is gaining or
losing in his banking account, so to call it, by every day’s work; every
portion of his studies will tell directly for or against him in the
final competition, upon which so much depends.</p>

<p><a name = "poly_buildings_final" id = "poly_buildings_final">Such is
the powerful mechanism</a> by which the French nation forces out of the
mass of boys attending their ordinary schools the talent and the science
which they need for their civil and military services. The efforts made
for admission to this great scientific school of the public services,
the struggle for the first places at the exit from it, must be more than
enough, it is thought, to establish the habits of hard work, to
accumulate the information and attainment, and almost to create the
ability which the nation requires for the general good.</p>

<p>We may now follow the student through his course of two years’ study.
<a name = "poly_buildings_first" id = "poly_buildings_first">The first
year’s work</a> may be mainly divided into three portions of unequal
length; two of them of about four months each (with an additional
fortnight of private study and examination,) are mainly given to hard
lecturing, whilst the third portion of two months is devoted to private
study and to the examinations.</p>

<p>In accordance with this arrangement of the year, the four hardest
subjects are thus distributed. Analysis and descriptive geometry, the
staple work of the school&mdash;its Latin, as M. de Barante called
it&mdash;come in the first four months; there is then a pause for
private study and a general examination in these two subjects
(<i>interrogations générales</i> as distinct from the <i>interrogations
particulières</i> of the <i>répétiteurs</i>.) This brings us to the
middle of March. Analysis and geometry are then laid aside for the rest
of the year, and for the next portion of four months the pupils work at
mechanics and geodesy, private study and a general examination
completing this course also. Important lectures on physics and chemistry
run on during both these periods, and are similarly closed by private
study and a general examination. The less telling evening classes of
French literature and German end at the beginning of June, and landscape
and figure drawing only last half the year. It may be observed also,
that, as a general rule, there is on each day one, and only one, really
difficult lecture. This is immediately preceded and followed by private
study, but then comes something lighter, as a relief, such as drawing or
work in the laboratories.</p>

<p>The chief feature in the third portion of the year is the complete
break in the lectures for general private study (<i>étude libre</i>,) a
month
<span class = "pagenum">

or six weeks before the closing examination at the end of the year. The
immediate prospect of this prevents any undue relaxing of the work; and
it is curious to observe here how private efforts and enforced system
are combined together, for even the private efforts are thus
systematized and directed. The closing examination of the first year
begins on the 1st and ends on the 25th of September.</p>

<p>The total number of lectures in each branch of study, with the dates
when they respectively commence and finish, and the period when the
general examinations (<i>interrogations générales</i>) take place, are
exhibited in the following tables, and we should add that the interval
between the close of each course and the commencement of the chief
yearly examination is devoted to free study.</p>

<h4><a name = "poly_exams" id = "poly_exams" href = "#poly_start">V. THE
EXAMINATIONS, PARTICULARLY THAT OF THE FIRST YEAR AND THE FINAL
ONE.</a></h4>

<p>We have now brought the pupil nearly to the end of his career, but
must previously say a few words about his examinations, the chief epochs
which mark his progress, and the last of which fixes his position almost
for life. For this purpose it is necessary to recapitulate briefly what
has been said in different places of the whole <a name =
"poly_exams_ordinary" id = "poly_exams_ordinary">examinatorial
system</a> of the Polytechnic School.</p>

<p>1. All the professors require the students in their studying rooms,
to answer questions in writing on the courses as they go through them: a
different question is given to each student, and every third question is
of such a nature as to involve a numerical example in the reply.</p>

<p>These questions are given in the proportion of one to about every
four lectures, and the replies after being examined by the professor or
<i>répétiteur</i>, are indorsed with a credit, varying from 0 to 20, and
the paper is then given back to the student, to be produced at the close
of the year.</p>

<p>2. Credits are assigned to the students for their ordinary
manipulations in chemistry and physics, during the first year; and at
the close of each year, for their manipulations, in chemistry alone,
before the examiners.</p>

<p>3. The <i>répétiteurs</i> examine, (in the <i>interrogations
particulières</i>,) every ten or fourteen days, from six to eight
students during a sitting of two hours, on the subject of study lectured
on since the previous examination of the same kind. All these students
must continue present, and at the close the <i>répétiteur</i> assigns to
each a
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page79" id = "page79">79</a></span>
previous examination of the same kind. All these students must continue
present, and at the close the <i>répétiteur</i> assigns to each a credit
entirely dependent on the manner in which each has replied. The
professors and captains inspectors are occasionally present at these
examinations, which are discontinued at certain periods according to the
instructions of the director of studies.</p>

<p>4. At different intervals of time, from a fortnight to a month, as
may happen, after the close of the course in each branch of study,
general examinations (<i>interrogations générales</i>) are made by the
professors and <i>répétiteurs</i>. From four to six students are
examined together for at least two hours, and at the conclusion the
professor makes known to the director of studies the credit he has
granted to each student for the manner in which he has passed his
examination.</p>

<p>Such may be called the minor or ordinary examinations. But there is
an annual closing examination at the end of each year, which we will now
describe. <a name = "poly_exams_first" id = "poly_exams_first">The first
year’s annual examination</a> commences on the 1st and ends on the 25th
September. It is carried on by special examiners, (a&nbsp;different set
from those who conduct the entrance examinations,) and not by the
professors. These give to every student a credit between 0 and 20 in
each branch of study, according to the manner in which he replies.</p>

<p>The following table shows the co-efficients of influence allowed to
the different studies of the first year, subdivided also among the
particular classes of examination to which the student has been
subjected. The component parts of the co-efficients as well as the
co-efficients themselves, slightly vary from year to year, dependent on
the number of examinations:&mdash;</p>

study does not exceed <i>three</i>, or whose <i>general mean credit</i>
for the whole of the studies being the arithmetical mean of all the

accordingly excluded from the school, unless he has been prevented from
pursuing his studies by illness, in which case, when the facts are
thoroughly established, he will be allowed a second year’s study in the
second division, comprising the first year’s course of study.</p>

<p><a name = "poly_exams_second" id = "poly_exams_second">We now pass to
the second annual</a> or great final examination for admission to the
public services, remarking only that in the <i>interrogations
générales</i> of the second year the principal subjects of both years
are included.</p>

<p>The final examinations for admission into the public service commence
about the 10th September, and last about one month. They are conducted
by the same examiners who examined at the close of the first year. These
are five in number, and appointed by the minister of war. One of these
takes analysis; a second, mechanics; a third, descriptive geometry and
geodesy; the fourth, physics; and the fifth, chemistry.</p>

<p>The examination in military art and topography is conducted by a
captain of engineers specially appointed for the purpose; and in the
same manner the examination in German is carried on by a professor,
usually a civilian, specially but not permanently appointed.</p>

<p>The questions are oral, and extend over the whole course of study
pursued during the two years. Each student is taken separately for one
hour and a quarter on different days by each of the five examiners; each
examiner examines about eight students daily.</p>

<p>A table, very similar to that already given, is prepared under the
superintendence of the Director of studies for every student, to
ascertain the numerical amount of his credits in each branch of study,
the co-efficients of influences for the particular subject of study and
nature of examination being extracted from a table similar to that in
page 80, and when these tables have all been completed, a general list
of all the students is made out, arranged in the order of their
merits.</p>

<p>Formerly, conduct was permitted to exercise some slight influence on
their position, but that is no longer the case.</p>

<p>The same regulations exist, as regards the minimum amount of
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page82" id = "page82">82</a></span>
credit that will entitle the students to enter into the public service,
as have already been stated above in reference to the passage from the

</table>

<p>From the preceding tables and explanations, it will be apparent that,
as the whole of the students for each year are compelled to follow
precisely the same course of study, the system of professorial
instruction, combined with the constant tutelage and supervision
exercised by the <i>répétiteurs</i>, and the examinations
(<i>interrogations particulières</i>) of the <i>répétiteurs</i>, at
short intervals of time, have for their principal object the keeping
alive in the minds of the students the information which has been
communicated to them. As a stimulus to continuous and unceasing
exertion, it will be seen by an inspection of the tables of the
co-efficients of influence, that the manner in which the students acquit
themselves from day to day, and from week to week, is made an element,
and a very important one, in determining their final position in the
list arranged according to merit, exceeding as it does in most instances
the influence exerted on their classification by their final examination
at the close of each year. This principle thus recognizes not only their
knowledge at the end of each year, but also the manner in which they
have proved it to the professors and <i>répétiteurs</i> in the course of
the year; and with reference to the second year’s study, the final
result of the first year’s classification exercises an influence
amounting to
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page83" id = "page83">83</a></span>
about one-third of the whole, in the final classification at the end of
the second year.</p>

<p>It follows also, that as the examinations at the end of each year are
made by examiners, otherwise unconnected with the school, and not by the
professors belonging to it, the positions of the students in the
classified list is partly dependent on the judgment of the professors
with whom they are constantly in communication, and partly on the public
examiners, whom they meet only in the examination rooms.<a class = "tag"
name = "tag1_10" id = "tag1_10" href = "#note1_10">10</a></p>

<p>The examiners of the students are not frequently changed, and
practically the same may be said of the examiners for admission.</p>

<p>Such, at least, is the result of a comparison of the selections made
by the students during eight different years.</p>

<p>This preference of the civil to the military services has been the
subject of frequent complaints on the part of the military authorities
to the minister of war.</p>

<p>No steps have, however, been taken by the French government to
prevent the <i>free</i> choice of a profession being granted to the most
successful students.</p>

<p>We have now followed the student at the Polytechnic to the end of his
school career. He is then to pass to his particular School of
Application, in which (as&nbsp;the name implies) he is taught to apply
his science to practice. It is difficult to state precisely the amount
of such science which the highest pupils may be thought to possess on
leaving; the best idea of it will be gained by reference to the
programmes of the most important of the lectures. It is also needless to
dwell again on the main features of the school&mdash;the emulation
called forth, the minute method, the great prizes offered for sustained
labor. We must, however, make some remarks on these points before
concluding our account, so far as they bear on the subject of military
education.</p>


<h4><a name = "poly_general" id = "poly_general" href =
"#poly_start">VI. GENERAL REMARKS.</a></h4>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>1. Keeping out of sight for the moment some defects both in the
principles and details of the education of this school, the method of
teaching adopted seems to us excellent, and worthy of careful study. In
this remark we allude principally to the skillful combination of two
methods which have been generally thought incompatible; for it unites
the well-prepared lecture of a German professor, with the close personal
questioning of a first-rate English school or college lecture. But
besides this, its whole system is admirably adapted for the class of
pupils it educates.</p>

<p>These pupils are generally not of the wealthy classes; they are able,
and struggling for a position in life. On all these grounds their own
assistance in the work may be calculated upon. Yet they are not left to
themselves to make the most of their professors’ lectures. The aid of
<i>répétiteurs</i>, even more valuable in its constant “prudent
interrogations,” than in the explanations afforded, is joined to the
stimulus given by marking every step of proficiency, and by making all
tell on the last general account. But though the routine and method of
the school are so elaborate, play is given to the individual freedom of
the pupils in their private work, and this is managed so skillfully that
the private work is made immediately to precede the final examination,
on which mainly depends the pupil’s place for life. Thus from first to
last they are carried on by their system without being cramped by it;
every circumstance favorable to study is made the most of; rigorous
habit, mental readiness,
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page85" id = "page85">85</a></span>
the power of working with others, and the power of working for
themselves, the ambition for immediate and permanent success, all the
objects and all the methods which students ever have in view, support
and stimulate those of the Polytechnic in their two years’ career.</p>

<p>2. The mainspring, however, of the school’s energy is the competition
amongst the pupils themselves, and this could hardly exist without the
great prizes offered to the successful. This advantage, added to the
general impulse of the early days of the Empire, has no doubt powerfully
contributed to the great position of the school. It has made it a kind
of university of the <i>élite</i> mathematicians, and as in England
young men look to the prizes of the universities, and the professions to
which they lead, as their best opening in life, so in France, ever since
the first revolution, the corresponding class has inclined to the active
and chiefly military career which is offered by the great competitive
school of the country.</p>

<p>3. A preparatory school of this remarkable character can not but
exercise a very powerful influence over those three-fourths of its
pupils who leave it to enter the army. The obvious question is whether
the attempt is not made to teach more than is either necessary or
desirable for military purposes, and to this suspicion may be added the
fact that the civil prizes being more in request than the military, many
of those who enter the army do so in the first instance reluctantly, and
that the pupils at the bottom of the list appear to be often such marked
failures as to imply either great superficiality or premature
exhaustion.</p>

<p>4. In studying the Polytechnic School we have had these points
constantly brought before us, and feeling the difficulty of discussing
them fully, we beg to invite attention to the evidence sent us in reply
to some questions which we addressed on the subject to some
distinguished scientific officers and civilians connected with the
school. We will give briefly the result of our own inquiries.</p>

<p>5. The complaint of General Paixhans has been quoted. He urges that a
considerable proportion of the army pupils are mere <i>queues de
promotion</i>, and quite insufficient to form <i>le corps et surtout la
tête</i> of troops <i>d’élite</i>.</p>

<p>Other not inconsistent complaints we heard ourselves, of the mental
exhaustion and the excessively abstract tendencies of many of the
military pupils of the school.</p>

<p>6. Such are the complaints. There is certainly reason to think that,
with regard to the twenty or thirty lowest pupils on the list, those of
General Paixhans are well founded. These are the <i>breaks down</i>, and
we are at first surprised that, entering as they must do,<a class =
"tag" name = "tag1_11" id = "tag1_11" href = "#note1_11">11</a> with
high attainments,
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page86" id = "page86">86</a></span>
they should fall so low as the marks in the tables (with which we are
most liberally supplied) prove to be the case.</p>

<p>At the same time, we believe that no teaching ever has provided or
will provide against many failures out of one hundred and seventy
pupils, even among those who promised well at first: and if the standard
of the majority of pupils is high at the Polytechnique, and the point
reached by the first few <i>very</i> high, it is no reproach that the
descent amongst the last few should be very rapid.</p>

<p>With regard to the assertion, that the teaching is excessive and
leads too much to abstract pursuits for soldiers, it may be partially
true. Perhaps the general passion for science has led to an overstrained
teaching for the army, even for its scientific corps; and yet would it
be allowed by officers of the highest scientific ability, either in the
French or the English army, that less science is required for the
greatest emergencies of military than for those of civil engineering, or
for the theory of projectiles than for working the department of
saltpetre?</p>

<p>It may, however, be true that an attempt is made at the Polytechnic
to exact <i>from all</i> attainments which can only be reached by <i>a
few</i>.</p>

<p>7. With this deduction, we must express our opinion strongly in favor
of the influence of the Polytechnic on the French army. We admit that in
some instances pupils who have failed in their attempt at civil prizes
enter the army unwillingly, but they are generally soon penetrated with
its <i>esprit de corps</i>, and they carry into it talent which it would
not otherwise have obtained. Cases of overwork no doubt occur, as in the
early training for every profession, but (following the evidence we have
received) we have no reason to think them so numerous as to balance the
advantage of vigorous, thoughtful study directed early towards a
profession which, however practical, is eminently benefited by it. “It
can not be said,” was the verdict of one well fitted to express an
opinion, “that there is too much science in the French army.”</p>

<p>8. Assuming, however, the value of the scientific results produced in
the French army by the Polytechnic, it by no means follows that a
similar institution would be desirable in another country. Without much
discussion it may be safely said that the whole history and nature of
the institution&mdash;the offspring of a national passion for system and
of revolutionary excitement&mdash;make it thoroughly peculiar to
France.</p>

<p>9. Some obvious defects must be noticed. The curious rule of
forbidding the use of <i>all</i> books whatever is a very exaggerated
attempt to make the pupil to rely entirely on the professors and
<i>répétiteurs</i>. The exclusive practice of <i>oral</i> examination
also seems to us a defect. Certainly every examination should give a
pupil an opportunity of showing such
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page87" id = "page87">87</a></span>
valuable qualities as readiness and power of expression; but an
examination solely oral appears to us an uncertain test of depth or
accuracy of knowledge; and however impartial or practiced an examiner
may be, it is impossible that questions put orally can present exactly
the same amount of difficulty, and so be equally fair, to the several
competitors.</p>

<p>At the same time, although in all great competing examinations the
chief part of the work (in&nbsp;our opinion) should be <i>written</i>,
the constant oral cross-questioning of the minor examinations at the
Polytechnic, appeared to be one of the most stimulating and effective
parts of their system,</p>

<p>10. A more serious objection than any we have named lies against the
exclusive use of mathematical and scientific training, to the neglect of
all other, as almost the only instrument of education. The spirit of the
school, as shown especially by its entrance examinations, is opposed to
any literary study. This is a peculiar evil in forming characters for a
liberal profession like the army. Such a plan may indeed produce
striking results, if the sole object is to create distinguished
mathematicians, though even then the acuteness in one direction is often
accompanied by an unbalanced and extravagant judgment in another. But a
great school should form the whole and not merely a part of the man; and
as doing this, as strengthening the whole mind, instead of forcing on
one or two of its faculties&mdash;as giving, in a word, what is justly
called a <i>liberal</i> education&mdash;we are persuaded that the system
of cultivating the taste for historical and other similar studies, as
well as for mere science, is based on a sounder principle than that
which has produced the brilliant results of the Polytechnic.</p>

<p>11. It may be added, in connection with the above remark, that as the
entrance examination at the Polytechnic influences extensively the
teaching of the great French schools, and is itself almost solely
mathematical, it tends to diffuse a narrow and exclusive pursuit of
science, which is very alien from the spirit of English teaching.</p>

<p>12. We may sum up our remarks on the Polytechnic School
thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>Regarded simply as a great Mathematical and Scientific School, its
results in producing eminent men of science have been extraordinary. It
has been the great (and a truly great) Mathematical University of
France.</p>

<p>Regarded again as a Preparatory School for the public works, it has
given a very high scientific education to civil engineers, whose
scientific education in other countries (and amongst ourselves) is
believed to be much slighter and more accidental.</p>

<p>Regarded as a school for the scientific corps of the army, its
peculiar mode of uniting in one course of competition candidates for
civil and military services, has probably raised scientific thought to a
higher point in the French than in any other army.</p>

<p>Regarded as a system of teaching, the method it pursues in developing
the talents of its pupils appears to us the best we have ever
studied.</p>

<p>It is in its studies and some of its main principles that the example
of the Polytechnic School may be of most value. In forming or improving
any military school, we can not shut our eyes to the successful working
at the Polytechnic of the principle, which it was the first of all
schools to initiate, the making great public prizes the reward and
stimulus of the pupil’s exertions. We may observe how the state has here
encouraged talent by bestowing so largely assistance upon all
successful, but poor pupils, during their school career. We may derive
some lessons from its method of teaching, though the attempt to imitate
it might be unwise. Meanwhile, without emulating the long established
scientific prestige of the Polytechnic, we have probably amongst
ourselves abundant materials for a military scientific education, at
least as sound as that given at this great School.</p>

<p>In addition to the Schools of Application for Artillery and <ins

title = "hyphen in ‘En-/gineers’ invisible at line break">Engineers</ins> at Metz, and of Infantry and Cavalry at St. Cyr,
of which a pretty full account will be given, the following Public

<div class = "in-one">
<p class = "heading"><span class = "smallcaps">Gunpowder and
Saltpetre.</span>&mdash;(<i>Poudres et Salpêtres.</i>)</p>

<p>In France the manufacture of gunpowder is solely in the hands of the
Government. The pupils of the Polytechnic who enter the gunpowder and
saltpetre service, are sent in succession to different powder-mills and
saltpetre refineries, so as to gain a thorough acquaintance with all the
details of the manufacture.</p>

<p>On first entering the service they are named <i>élèves des
poudres</i>. They afterwards rise successively to the rank of
assistant-commissary, commissary of the third, of the second, and of the
first class.</p>

<p class = "heading"><span class =
"smallcaps">Navy.</span>&mdash;(<i>Marine.</i>)</p>

<p>A small number of the pupils of the Polytechnic enter the Navy. They
receive the rank of <i>élève de première classe</i>, from the date of
their admission.</p>

<p>They are sent to the ports to serve afloat. After two years’ service
they may be promoted to the rank of <i>enseigne de vaisseau</i>, on
passing the necessary examinations, on the same terms precisely as the
<i>élèves de premiere classe</i> of the Naval School.</p>

<p class = "heading"><span class = "smallcaps">Marine
Artillery.</span>&mdash;(<i>Artillerie de la Marine.</i>)</p>

<p>The French marine artillery differs from the English corps of the
same name, in not serving afloat. Its duties are confined to the ports
and to the colonies. It is governed by the same rules and ordinances as
the artillery of the army.</p>

<p>The foundries of La Villeneuve, Rochefort, Ruelle, Névers, and Saint
Gervais are under its direction.</p>

<p>The officers of the marine artillery are liable to be sent on board

<p>The naval architects are charged with the construction and repair of
vessels of war, and with the manufacture of all the machinery required
in the ports and dockyards. The factories of Indret and La Chaussade are
under their direction.</p>

<p>The pupils of the Polytechnic enter the corps of naval architects
with the rank of <i>élève du Génie Maritime</i>. They are sent to the
School of Application of Naval Architects at L’Orient. After two years’
instruction they undergo an examination, and, if successful, they are
promoted to the rank of sub-architect of the third class, so far as
vacancies admit. They may be advanced to the second class after a
service of two years.</p>

determining their pension. On their return to Paris they are employed in
the construction of maps and charts.</p>

<p>The hydrographers have the same rank and advantage as the naval
architects.</p>

<p>On leaving the Polytechnic, the pupils enter the corps of
hydrographers with the rank of <i>élève hydrographe</i>. After two
years’ service, and one season employed on the coast, they become
sub-hydrographers without further examination.</p>

<p>The Polytechnic furnishes exclusively the pupils for the Government
Civil Engineer Corps. On leaving the Polytechnic, the pupils enter the
School of Application in Paris. The course of instruction here extends
over a period of three years. It commences each year on the first of
November, and lasts till the 1st of April. After the final examination,
the pupils are arranged according to the results of the examination and
the amount of work performed.</p>

<p>The pupils enter the college with the rank of <i>élève de troisième
classe</i>. They rise successively to the second and to the first class,
on making the requisite progress in their studies.</p>

<p>From the 1st of May to the 1st of November the <i>élèves</i> of the
second and the third class are sent on duty into the provinces. The
<i>élèves</i> of the first class who have completed their three years’
course of instruction, are employed in the duties of ordinary engineers,
or are detached on special missions. In about three years after quitting
the college, they may be appointed ordinary engineers of the second
class.</p>

<p>The engineers of the <i>Ponts et Chaussées</i> prepare the projects
and plans, and direct the execution of the works for the construction,
preservation, and repair of high roads, and of the bridges and other
structures connected with these roads, with navigable rivers, canals,
seaports, lighthouses, &amp;c. They are charged with the superintendence
of railways, of works for draining marshes, and operations affecting
water-courses; they report upon applications to erect factories driven
by water. Under certain circumstances, they share with the Mining
Engineers the duty of inspecting steam-engines.</p>

<p>Permission is not unfrequently granted to the engineers of the
<i>Ponts et Chaussées</i> to accept private employment. They receive
leave of absence for a certain time, retaining their rank and place in
their corps, but without pay.</p>

<p class = "heading"><span class = "smallcaps">Mining
Engineers.</span>&mdash;(<i>Mines.</i>)</p>

<p>The Mining School of Application is organized almost exactly on the
same plan as that of the <i>Ponts et Chaussées</i>: like the latter, it
is in Paris.</p>

<p>The course of instruction, which lasts three years, consists of
lectures, drawing, chemical manipulation and analysis, visits to
manufactories, geological excursions, and the preparation of projects
for mines and machines. Journeys are made by the pupils, during the
second half of the last two years of the course, into the mineral
districts of France or foreign countries for the purpose of studying the
practical details of mining. These journeys last one hundred days at
least. The pupils are required to examine carefully the railroads and
the geological features of the countries they pass through, and to keep
a journal of facts and observations. In the final examination, marks are
given for every part of their work.</p>

<p>The mining engineers, when stationed in the departments, are charged
to see that the laws and ordinances relating to mines, quarries, and
factories are properly observed, and to encourage, either directly or by
their advice, the extension of all branches of industry connected with
the extraction and treatment of minerals.</p>

<p>One of their principal duties is the superintendence of mines and
quarries, in the three-fold regard of safety of the workmen,
preservation of the soil, and economical extraction of the minerals.</p>

<p>They exercise a special control over all machines designed for the
production of steam, and over railways, as far as regards the metal and
fuel.</p>

<p>The instructors in the School of Application in Paris, and in the
School of Mines at St. Etienne, are exclusively taken from the members
of the corps.</p>

<p>Like the engineers of the <i>Ponts et Chaussées</i>, the mining
engineers obtain permission to undertake private employment.</p>

<p class = "heading"><span class = "smallcaps">Tobacco

Paris, chemistry, physics, and mechanics, as applied to the preparation
of tobacco. They make themselves acquainted at the same time with the
details of the manufacture and with the accounts and correspondence.</p>

<p>They are generally promoted to the rank of <i>élevè de 1<sup>re</sup>
classe</i> in two years. They rise afterwards successively to the rank
of sub-inspector, inspector, and director.</p>

<p>After completing their instruction at the manufactory of Paris, the
<i>élevès</i> are sent to tobacco manufactories in other parts of
France.</p>

<p>Promotion in the tobacco service does not follow altogether by
seniority. Knowledge of the manufacture and attention to their duties
are much considered, as the interests of the treasury are involved in
the good management of the service.</p>

<p class = "heading"><span class =
"smallcaps">Telegraphs.</span>&mdash;(<i>Lignes Telégraphiques.</i>)</p>

<p>On entering the telegraphic service the pupils of the Polytechnic
receive the rank of <i>élevè inspecteur</i>.</p>

<p>They pass the first year at the central office. During the six winter
months they study, under two professors, the composition of signals, and
the regulations which insure their correctness and dispatch, the working
of telegraphs and the manner of repairing them, the theory of the mode
of tracing lines and of determining the height of the towers,
electro-magnetism and its application to the electric telegraph. During
the summer months they make tours of inspection. They assist in the
execution of works, and practice leveling and the laying down of
lines.</p>

<p>At the end of the year the <i>élevès inspecteurs</i> undergo an
examination, and, if there are vacancies, are appointed provisional
inspectors. After a year in this rank they may be appointed inspectors
either in France or Algeria.</p>

<p>Each inspector has charge of a district containing from twelve to
fifteen stations. He is obliged to make a tour of inspection once a
month of at least ten days’ duration.</p>

<p>After a certain number of years’ service the inspector rises to the
rank of director. Besides their other duties, the directors exercise a
general superintendence over the inspectors.</p>

<p class = "heading"><i>General Arrangements.</i></p>

<p>The pupils take in the lecture-room notes and sketches upon sheets,
which are presented to the professor and the “répétiteurs” at each
interrogation. The care with which these notes are taken is determined
by “marks,” of which account is taken in arranging the pupils in order
of merit.</p>

<p>The plans are made according to programmes, of which the conditions
are different for different pupils. The drawings are in general
accompanied with decimal scales, expressing a simple ratio to the meter.
They carry inscriptions written conformably to the admitted models, and
are, when necessary, accompanied with verbal descriptions.</p>

<p>In the graphic exercises of the first part of the course, the
principal object is to familiarize the pupils with the different kinds
of geometrical drawing, such as elevations and shaded sections, oblique
projections and various kinds of perspective. The pupils are also
accustomed to different constructions useful in stereotomy.</p>

<p>The subjects for graphic exercises in stereotomy are taken from
roofs, vaults, and staircases. Skew and oblique arches are the subject
of detailed plans.</p>

<p>Principal modes of generation of warped surfaces. When two warped
surfaces touch in three points of a common generatrix, they touch each

a generatrix touches the surface at one point in this line. The tangent

<p>Construction of the tangent planes and curves of contact of

paraboloid. The name of central point of a generatrix is given to the
point where it is met by the straight line upon which is measured its
shortest distance from the adjoining generatrix. The locus of these
points forms the line of striction of the surface. The vertex of the
normal paraboloid along a generating line is situated at the central
point. If the point of contact of a plane touching a warped surface
moves along a generatrix, beginning from the central point, the tangent
of the angle which the tangent plane makes with its primitive position
is proportional to the length described by the point of contact. The
tangent

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page101" id = "page101">101</a></span>
<p>In the tangent plane, at a point of a surface, there exists a conic
section, whose diameters are proportional to the square roots of the
radii of curvature of the normal sections to which they are tangents.
This curve is called the indicatrix. It is defined in form and position,
but not in magnitude. The normal sections tangential to the axes of the
indicatrix are called the principal sections.</p>

<p>The indicatrix an ellipse; convex surfaces; umbilici; line of
spherical curvatures.</p>

<p>The indicatrix a hyperbola; surfaces with opposite curvatures.</p>

<p>The assymplotes of the indicatrix have a contact of the second order
with the surface, and of the first order with the section of the surface
by its tangent plane.</p>

<p>A ruled surface has contrary curvatures at every point. The second
assymplotes of the indicatrices of all the points of the same generatrix
form a hyperboloid, if the surface has not directer-plane,&mdash;a
paraboloid, if it have one.</p>

<p>Curvature of developable surfaces.</p>

<p>There exists upon every surface two systems of orthogonal lines, such
that every straight line subject to move by gliding over either of them,
and remaining normal to the surface, will engender a developable
surface. These lines are called lines of curvature.</p>

the principal sections of the surface at that point.</p>

29&ndash;30.</span> <i>Division of Curves of Apparent Contour, and of
Separation of Light and Shadow into Real and Virtual Parts.</i></p>

<p>When a cone is circumscribed about a surface, at any point whatever
of the curve of contact, the tangent to this curve and the generatrix of
the cone are parallel to two conjugate diameters of the indicatrix.</p>

<p>Surfaces, as they are considered in shadows, envelop opaque bodies,
and the curve of contact of a circumscribed cone, only forms a
separation of light and shadow, for a luminous point at the summit of
the cone, when the generatrices of this cone are exterior. This line is
thus sometimes real and sometimes virtual.</p>

<p>Upon a convex surface, the curve of separation of light and shade is
either all real or all virtual. Upon a surface with contrary curvatures,
this curve presents generally a succession of real and virtual parts:
the curve of shadow cast from the surface upon itself presents a like
succession. These curves meet tangentially, and the transition from the
real to the virtual parts upon one and the other, take place at their
points of contact in such a way that the real part of the curve of
shadow continues the real part of the curve of separation of light and
shade. The circumscribed cones have edges of regression along the
generatrices, which correspond to the points of transition.</p>

<p>The lines of visible contour present analogous circumstances.</p>

worked by cams or circles giving motion to rods; the play of slides,
&amp;c.; cylinders of steam-engines, condenser, pistons, and various

This drawing represents, of the natural size, or on any other scale of
size considered suitable to show the nature of the partial actions only,

<i>Completion of the Notions acquired on this Subject.</i></p>

<p>Differential equations of the motion of a material point submitted to
the continued action of one or more forces. The acceleration of the
projection of a point upon any axis or plane is due to the projection of
the forces on this axis or plane. The acceleration along the trajectory
is due to the tangential force. Relation of the curvature to the
centripetal force. Introduction of the force of inertia into the
preceding enunciations.</p>

<p>The increase of the quantity of motion projected upon an axis or
taken along the trajectory is equal to the impulsion of the projected
resultant, or to that of the tangential force. The total impulsion of a
force is got by methods of calculation and of experiment analogous to
those which relate to <i>work</i>. The increase of the moment of the
quantity of motion in relation to any axis is equal to the total moment
of the impulsions of the forces during the same interval of time; direct
geometrical demonstration of this theorem. In decomposing the velocity
of the moving body into a velocity in the plane passing through the axis
of the moments, and a velocity of revolution perpendicular to this
plane, we may replace the moment of the quantity of motion in space by
the quantity of motion of revolution. Particular case known under the
name of the principle of areas.</p>

act on the system. Equation of virtual work which expresses this

forces.</p>


<p class = "heading"><i>General Theorems.</i></p>

<p>These theorems, four in number, are founded upon the principle of the
equality of action and reaction applied to internal forces. They may be
deduced from the preceding rule, but the three last are obtained more
simply by extending to a system of material points analogous theorems
established for isolated material points.</p>

impulsions of exterior forces about any axis. Analogy of these two
theorems with the equations of the equilibrium of a solid, in which the
forces are replaced by impulsions and quantities of motion.</p>

<p>Composition of impulsions, of quantities of motion, or the areas
which represent them. All the equations which can be obtained by the
application of the two theorems relative to quantities of motion and
impulsions, reduce themselves to six distinct equations. Particular case

<p>In applying to this case the first general rule of dynamics, the

<p class = "smallhead">ORGANIZATION AND CONDITION IN 1869.</p>

<p>The organization of the school, which is fixed by a Decree dated Nov.
30th, 1863, is of a military character. There is a staff of military
officers in addition to, and quite separate from, the staff employed in
the duties of instruction. The pupils wear uniform, which, however, is
more civil than military in appearance. They are formed into four
companies which together constitute a battalion; and, although they are
not actually subject to the penal code of the army, the discipline
maintained and the punishments inflicted are entirety military in
character.</p>

<p>The military establishment remains exactly as it was in 1856, and
consists of:</p>

<p>The Commandant, a General Officer, usually of the Artillery or the
Engineers, at present a General of Artillery.</p>

<p>A Second Commandant, a colonel or lieutenant-colonel, chosen from
among the former pupils of the school; at present a colonel of
Engineers.</p>

<p>Three captains of Artillery and three captains of Engineers, as
inspectors of studies, chosen also from former pupils of the school.</p>

<p>Six adjutants (<i>adjudants</i>), non-commissioned officers, usually
such as have been recommended for promotion.</p>

<p>Slight changes have been made in the civil establishment; it now
consists of:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. A Director of Studies, at present a colonel of Engineers.</p>

<p>2. Seventeen professors,<a class = "tag" name = "tag1_12" id =
"tag1_12" href = "#note1_12">12</a> (two additional professors for
history) seventeen <i>Répétiteurs</i> and assistant <i>Répétiteurs</i>,
and five drawing masters. Of the 17 professors, two are at present
officers of Engineers, and one an officer of Artillery; the remainder
are civilians, of whom three are members of the Academy of Sciences.</p>

<p>3. Five examiners for admission, and five for conducting the
examinations at the school. All of these at present are civilians.</p>

<p>4. An administrative staff consisting of a treasurer, librarian,
&amp;c.; and a medical staff.</p>

<p>The general control or supervision of the school is vested, under the
War Department, in four great boards or councils, viz.:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. A Board of Administration, composed of the Commandant, the Second
Commandant, the Director of Studies, two professors, two captains of the
military staff, and two members of the administrative staff. This board
has the superintendence of all the financial business, and all the
minutiæ of the internal administration of the school.</p>

<p>2. A Board of Discipline, consisting of the Second Commandant, the
Director of Studies, three captains of the Military Staff, and one major
of the army, selected from former pupils of the school.<a class = "tag"
name = "tag1_13" id = "tag1_13" href = "#note1_13">13</a> The duty of
this board is to decide upon cases of misconduct.</p>

<p>3. A Board of Instruction, whose members are, the Commandant, the
Second Commandant, the Director of Studies, the Examiners of Students,
the Professors, and two captains of the Military Staff; and whose chief
duty is to make recommendations relating to ameliorations in the studies
and the programmes of admission and of instruction in the school
to&mdash;</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page132" id = "page132">132</a></span>
<p>4. A Board of Improvement (<i>Conseil de Perfectionnement</i>),
charged with the general control of the studies, and formed
of:&mdash;</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>The Commandant, president,</p>
<p>The Second Commandant,</p>
<p>The Director of Studies,</p>
<p>Two delegates from the Naval Department,</p>
<p>Two delegates from the Department of Public Works,</p>
<p>One delegate from the Home or Finance Department,</p>
<p>Three delegates from the War Department,</p>
<p>Two members of the Academy of Sciences,</p>
<p>Two examiners of students,</p>
<p>Three professors of the school.</p>
</div>

<p>The delegates from the public departments are appointed by the
respective ministers; the members of the Academy, the examiners, and the
professors are selected by the Minister of War. The real management of
the school, so far as the course of instruction is concerned, is in the
hands of the <i>Conseil de Perfectionnement</i>; it will be seen that of
the 18 members composing it more than half are entirely independent of
the school, and are men of eminence in the various public services for
which the instruction at the Polytechnic is preparatory. One of the
chief duties of the Council is to see that the studies form a good
preparation for those of the more special schools (<i>Ecoles d’
Application</i>) for the civil and military services; and the eminent
character of its members gives great weight to the recommendations they
make to the Minister of War.</p>

<p>The annual expenses of the school, as extracted from the Budget for
1869, are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>The chief changes that have been made in regard to the course of
instruction since 1856, may be summarized as follows:</p>

<p>1. The more elementary portions of chemistry and physics which are
required in the entrance examination, but which were formerly repeated
at the school, have been omitted. The course of instruction in these
subjects is now confined to the more advanced portions which do not
enter into the entrance examination.</p>

<p>2. The mathematical courses have in some points been slightly
curtailed, and the number of lectures in French literature and German
have been diminished. By the modifications thus made in the programmes,
it has been found possible to shorten the whole course of study and to
increase the length of the vacations.</p>

<p>3. The subject of “Military Art,” which formerly entered into the
final examination
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page133" id = "page133">133</a></span>
is no longer taken into consideration in determining the order of merit
of the pupils. In this respect the course of instruction may be said to
have even less of a military character than formerly. Topographical
drawing is the single military subject which has any influence on the
final classification of the pupils, and this only to a very slight
extent.</p>

<p>4. History has been introduced as a subject of instruction. This
change was made in 1862. The course comprises general history, both
ancient and modern, but more especially the history of France in modern
times. The introduction of this subject appears to have arisen partly
from a feeling that an acquaintance with history was a necessary element
of a liberal education, and partly from a wish to meet, to some extent,
an objection often made to the Polytechnic course of instruction, that
it was too deficient in studies of a literary character. History,
however, like military art, is evidently still regarded as a subject of
only secondary importance and has no influence on the final
classification.</p>

<p>5. A diminution has been made in the number of examinations during
the course, by the suppression of one of the half-yearly examinations by
the professors (<i>interrogations générales</i>, as distinct from the
<i>interrogations particulières</i>) in each year. Further reference
will be made to this point when speaking of the examinations at the
school.</p>

<p>6. The importance of written exercises in determining the respective
merits of the pupils has been decreased, apparently from the difficulty
of establishing a security that such compositions were the unaided work
of the individual.</p>

<p>The following table shows the present course of instruction during
the two years, and the alterations which have been made in the number of
lectures in each subject since 1856:&mdash;</p>

<p>In connection with several of the courses, such as descriptive
geometry, stereotomy, machinery, and architecture, much drawing is done
by the pupils; hand sketches are taken of the diagrams shown in the
lecture-room, and finished drawings are afterwards executed in the
<i>salles d’étude</i>. In addition to this, 30 attendances of two or
three hours each, distributed over the two years, are especially devoted
to drawing more elaborate plans and elevations of architectural
constructions and machinery. The practical applications of the
theoretical instruction are limited to manipulations in the laboratory
in connection with the course of lectures on chemistry and physics.
Towards the close of the second year the pupils are also taken to visit
some of the large manufacturing establishments in Paris, in order to
gain a practical acquaintance with machinery.</p>

<p>All the subjects taught at the school are obligatory, but history and
military art, as already stated, have no influence in determining the
order of merit of the pupils in the final result.</p>

<p>The only instruction in practical military exercises, which is
compulsory upon all, is that in drill. The pupils are exercised under
arms in company drill, and are also occasionally drilled as a battalion;
but very little importance is attached to this point&mdash;the only
really military portion of their training. Drill goes on only for about
three months in each year during the spring and summer, and even during
this brief period only takes place about twice a week. By the
regulations of the school the pupils should be exercised in musketry
practice, but although they are armed with the Chassepot rifle this
regulation is never carried out. Instruction is given in fencing and
gymnastics, but attendance at both is voluntary, and scarcely more than
half the pupils take advantage of it. Neither riding nor swimming are
taught at the school.</p>

<p>The school year commences about the 1st of November, and terminates
about the first of August. Some seven months of the year are given up to
lectures and the ordinary routine of study; about two months are
occupied with the annual examinations and private preparation for them;
the remaining three months&mdash;August, September, and
October&mdash;are the vacation. In addition to this long vacation, from
eight to twelve days are allowed after the periodical examination, which
takes place near the end of February, at the close of the first portion
of each year’s study.</p>

<p>One peculiarity in the arrangements of the school is that the
subjects of each year’s course are not all studied simultaneously. The
lectures in the main subjects of instruction&mdash;those which, as a
rule, present the most difficulty&mdash;are divided into courses which
continue only during a certain portion of each year. Thus in the junior
division, analysis and descriptive geometry are the mathematical
subjects studied during the first three months, or three months and a
half. The course in them is then concluded; an examination by the
professors (<i>interrogation générale</i>) is held in these subjects,
and they are laid aside for the remainder of the year, though they enter
into the examination at the close of the year. Their place is then taken
by a course of lectures in mechanics and geodesy. Similarly in the
second year, analysis and mechanics are the subjects of the first course
of lectures, at the termination of which there is an examination; and
for the remainder of the year no further lectures in them are given,
stereotomy and military art taking their place.</p>

<p>The subjects involving as a rule less difficulty&mdash;such as
history, French literature, German, and drawing&mdash;are spread over
the whole year, forming generally the evenings’ occupation.</p>

<p><a name = "metz_history_1679" id = "metz_history_1679"><span class =
"firstword">The</span> first French Artillery School</a> was founded in
the time of Louis XIV. (in&nbsp;1679) at Douai. It had but a short
existence: and it was <a name = "metz_history_1720" id =
"metz_history_1720">only in 1720</a> (under the Regency,) when the Royal
Regiment of Artillery received a new organization, that schools of
theory were permanently founded in each of the seven towns where there
were garrisons of artillery. But no academy properly so called was
established before that founded by <a name = "metz_history_1756" id =
"metz_history_1756">D’Argenson at La Fère</a>, in 1756, with a staff of
two professors of mathematics, and two of drawing. This was transferred
to Bapaume, near the Flemish frontier, in 1766, re-transferred to La
Fère, and suppressed, among other schools, at the beginning of the
Revolution.</p>

<p><a name = "metz_history_1749" id = "metz_history_1749">Of early
Engineer Schools</a> there was only one, the very distinguished School
of Mézières, near the northern frontier. This was founded in 1749, also
under the ministry of D’Argenson; Monge was a professor there; and it
had a very high reputation down to its suppression in the
Revolution.</p>

<p>When the wars of the Revolution broke out, Provisional Schools for
giving a brief course of rapid instruction was established at Metz for
the engineers, and at Chalons-sur-Marne for the artillery. These had to
supply, at a great disadvantage, the officers needed for the protection
of the invaded frontier.</p>

<p><a name = "metz_history_1795" id = "metz_history_1795">It was
intended originally</a> that the Polytechnic, established in 1794,
should send engineers direct to the army; but it was quickly found to be
a better plan to allow the pupils destined for this service first to
spend some little time at Metz; which thus, in October, 1795, became a
School of Application for Engineers. The artillery pupils in like manner
went to Châlons. This separate system of two Schools of Application
continued till 1802, when the establishment at Châlons was united with
that of Metz, and Metz became what it has since continued to be, the
seat of the United School of Application for the two services. The
Polytechnic students who
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page138" id = "page138">138</a></span>
select the <i>Artillerie de terre</i>, <i>Artillerie de mer</i>, or the
<i>Génie militaire</i>, enter here to receive the special and
professional instruction deemed requisite to fit them for actual
employment.</p>

<p>The students quitting the Polytechnic in the manner described in the
account of that school, at the average age of twenty-one, enter the
School of Application, with the provisional rank, the uniform, and the
pay of sub-lieutenants (<i>sous-lieutenants</i>.) The ordinary term of
residence is two years. Under special circumstances this may be
shortened; and in case of illness or want of application individual
students are occasionally retained for a third year. Each new body of
students, each <i>admission</i> or <i>promotion</i>, is classified at
the end of the first year, and the students composing it are arranged in
order of merit in accordance with the reports of the professors, but
without an examination; at the close of the second year they pass a
final examination before the Board of Officers, and are definitively
placed in the corps they have chosen, the artillery or engineers,
according to the order of merit. They are allowed to count, as regards
retirement from the service and towards military decorations, four
year’s service on account of the two years passed at the Polytechnic
School, and of the time passed in preparing for admission to it,
reckoning from the day of their admission to the School of
Application.</p>

<p><a name = "metz_location" id = "metz_location">Metz is a fortified
place</a> on the Prussian frontier, the seat of war at the time of the
school’s first foundation; it is on the line of railway to Mannheim,
about thirty miles from the point where this branch diverges from the
main line to Strasburg. The Moselle flows through the town, and is
employed, with its little affluent the Seille, in the military defenses.
The garrison numbers 10,000 men; there is an Arsenal, a school of
Pyrotechny for the manufacture of rockets, two Regimental Schools, one
of Artillery and the other of Engineers. The School of Application
occupies buildings erected on the site, and partly the original
buildings themselves, of a suppressed Benedictine monastery. Three sides
of the cloistered monastic quadrangle are devoted to the offices,
lecture-rooms, galleries and halls of study. A&nbsp;fourth, formerly the
ancient church, is converted into a <i>salle des manœuvres</i>. There is
an adjoining residence for the commandant; and a separate modern
building, four stories in height, affords lodging to the young men.</p>

<p>The <i>salle des manœuvres</i> is a large area under a lofty roof,
rising to the whole height of the buildings of the quadrangle; it
contains artillery of various descriptions, mortars, field and siege
guns placed as in a battery, and is amply large enough to allow cannon
to be
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page139" id = "page139">139</a></span>
moved and exercises performed when the state of the weather may make it
desirable.</p>

<p>The amphitheaters or lecture rooms, much on the same system as those
at the Polytechnic, are two in number, one for each of the two
divisions. Officers of the artillery and engineers who are in garrison,
are entitled, if they please, to attend the lectures, and other officers
also may be admitted by permission.</p>

<p>The galleries, partly on the ground floor, partly on the first floor,
contain very good collections of models of artillery, ancient and
modern, of sets of small arms, of tools, of locks, barrels and other
portions of muskets in various stages of the process of their
manufacture, of specimens of carpentry and roofing, of minerals, of
models of fortifications, bridges, coffer-dams, locks, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The library on the first floor has an adjoining reading room; and
near it is the examination room, of which further mention will be made.
The three halls of study (<i>salles d’étude</i>) on the first floor are
on a different plan from those of the Polytechnic, each one being large
enough to accommodate a whole division (seventy students.) Three rooms
are also provided for the professors to prepare their lectures in.</p>

<p>The barracks, on the opposite side of the open space used for drill
and exercises, form a lofty and handsome building, entered by separate
staircases, the ground-floor rooms of each being assigned to a servant,
who undertakes to provide attendance for all the young men lodging in
the rooms above. The rooms are comfortable, mostly double-bedded, the
bedroom serving also as a sitting room, and a small adjoining closet
being used for washing, &amp;c. Twenty or twenty-two appear to be thus
accommodated on each staircase; there are lodgings altogether for one
hundred and forty-five. A&nbsp;certain number of the senior
sub-lieutenants would, probably, on the arrival of the new cadets from
the Polytechnic, be removed to lodge in the town.</p>

<p>There is a riding-school adjoining the court; stables, for
thirty-three horses, which are kept for the use of the pupils, and
lodgings for the attendants are provided in the neighborhood.</p>

<p>The mere description of the buildings shows at once that the system
is different in many respects from that of the Polytechnic. Young men of
twenty-one and twenty-two years of age, already holding provisional
commissions in the service, receiving the pay and wearing the uniform of
sub-lieutenants, are naturally allowed much greater freedom of action.
They live, and partly also study, not in the halls of study, but in
their own rooms; they take their
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page140" id = "page140">140</a></span>
meals in the town, where they frequent the <i>cafés</i> and
<i>restaurants</i> of their choice. The <i>rappel</i> summons them every
morning to rise and attend a roll-call at half-past five or six;
military exercises, riding, or interrogations, similar to the
<i>interrogations particulières</i>, require the presence of a portion
of the number, but the rest are free to return to their rooms. At ten
they have to attend either the day’s lecture, followed by employment in
the halls of study, till four o’clock P.M., or they proceed at once to
the halls of study, and set to work on the drawings, designs, projects,
&amp;c., which are described hereafter in the account of the studies.
From four to half-past five P.M.; drill, exercises, and riding occupy a
portion of the number, probably those who were not called for in the
morning. After half-past five they are left to themselves.</p>

<p>This ordinary routine of studies is interrupted in the summer months
by the occurrence of expeditions for making surveys, and for measuring
and sketching machines in manufactories. The young men are sent, two
together, to survey (<i>lever à boussole</i>;) singly for the
reconnaissance sketch <i>(lever à vue </i>;) and generally, a certain
number are distributed about a district not too large for an officer to
make his round in it, and see each day that all are at work. The
railways afford considerable facilities; the expeditions never occupy
more than ten days at a time, but they may be extended as far as
Strasburg.</p>

<p>There are no <i>répétiteurs</i> in the school; but the system of
<i>interrogations particulières</i> is carried on; and an examination by
the professor and an assistant professor takes place after, about, every
eight or ten lectures.</p>

<h4><a name = "metz_subjects" id = "metz_subjects" href =
"#special_metz">SUBJECTS AND METHOD OF STUDY.</a></h4>

<p>The studies at Metz consist of topography and geodesy, including
military drawing and surveying under special circumstances; field
fortification, military art and legislation, permanent fortification,
and the attack and defense of fortified places, accompanied by a sham
siege, without, however, executing the details practically on the
ground; architecture, as applicable to military buildings and
fortifications; the theory and practice of construction, and artillery.
The programmes of these studies are inserted at length in the
Appendix.</p>

<p>The instruction is given principally (as at the Polytechnic) by means
of a series of lectures, and the knowledge which the students have
acquired is first directly tested by requiring them to execute various
kinds of surveys of ground, either with or without the use of
instruments; to prepare drawings of buildings, workshops, and machines
in full detail (plan, elevation, and sections) from the measurements
they have recorded in their note-books or on their sketches, and to
accompany such drawings with descriptive memoirs of all particulars and
calculations that may be necessary to exhibit their purpose or
efficiency; to draw up projects and lay out works of field and permanent
fortification, or of those of attack or defense of a particular place on
certain given data, or according to the nature of the ground; to design
a military building, bridge,
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page143" id = "page143">143</a></span>
machine, or piece of ordnance, accompanied by estimates and descriptive
memoirs, showing in what manner the instructions and conditions under
which it was drawn up have been complied with; and to prepare a project
for the amelioration of the works of defense of a specified portion of a
fortified place known to be defective in some respects.</p>

<p><a name = "metz_subjects_common" id = "metz_subjects_common">The

<p>We should not omit to state that there is a short course on the
Veterinary Art.</p>

<p>The lectures, as before said, begin at 10 A.M., and they last usually
an hour and a half, and are followed by work in the halls of study. It
would appear, however, that very frequently the day’s occupation
consists simply of work in the halls of study (or&nbsp;occasionally out
of the school buildings, when the students are sent on some excursion;)
and, accordingly, in giving the account of the studies, a <i>day</i> or
day’s work will sometimes mean a lecture followed by drawing or other
employment, sometimes this drawing or other employment without any
lecture preceding. Taking a general
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page144" id = "page144">144</a></span>
average, the proportion appears to be about two lectures to five
<i>séances</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, sittings without lectures.</p>

<p>The system will be better understood by referring to the accompanying
tables, which are translated from the Project for the Employment of Time
for the year 1851&ndash;2, submitted for the approval of the Minister of
War. The dates in the first column indicate the days of the commencement
of each particular study. The school year, it should be said, begins on
the 1st of December.</p>

<h5><a name = "metz_exams_final" id = "metz_exams_final" href =

<p>About six weeks of free or voluntary study is allowed, immediately
prior to the Final Examination, for the sub-lieutenants to prepare for
their last effort.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page146" id = "page146">146</a></span>
<p>The examination which takes place prior to their leaving the School
of Application, is entirely conducted by a board of six officers, under
the presidency of a general officer alternately of the artillery or
engineers, the remaining members of the board consisting of a general
officer of each corps and three field officers of these corps; the last
three being specially charged with the duty of examining. It takes place
in a room set apart for the purpose, with a small interior room in
connection with it, into which the members of the board retire to
deliberate at the end of each student’s examination. The jury assembles
each year at the period fixed by the minister of war.</p>

<p>The three examining members conduct the examination of the students
in three different branches of study; the first more particularly
relating to artillery science, the second to engineering science, and
the third to mechanical science in its connection with the art of war.
The whole of the students who are to leave the school are first examined
in such one or other of these branches of study as may be determined
on.</p>

<p>The student under examination is specially questioned by the
examining officer in his subject, and occasionally by the president or
any other member of the board that may wish to do so, for three-quarters
of an hour. As soon as the examination of the student has been
concluded, the board retire to the adjoining room and compare their
notes of the credits they have severally awarded to the student under
examination, and they also examine his drawings, sketches, and memoirs
relating to the subjects on which he has been questioned, and prepared
during his two years of residence in the school. They severally note the
credits to which they consider him to be entitled for them, and adopt
the general mean.</p>

<p>As soon as the examination of the whole of the students in this
particular study has been finished, the examination in the next branch
is commenced, so that five or six days elapse between the first and
second examinations of the same student; and the same interval of time
occurs between the second and third examinations.</p>

<p>The credit allotted to each student by the board of examiners
represents, on the scale of 0 to 20, the manner in which he has replied
to the questions, or executed the drawings, sketches, memoirs, &amp;c.,
belonging to each course. The importance attached to each particular
branch of study is estimated very nearly by the amount of time allowed
for its execution divided by 20; and the definitive marks which each
student obtains for that branch of study is obtained from the products
of the numbers respectively representing
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page147" id = "page147">147</a></span>
the credit for answering, and that for the importance of the subjects on
which he has been examined.</p>

<p><a name = "metz_exams_class" id = "metz_exams_class">The final
classification of the order of merit</a>, in each arm of the service, is
arranged after a comparison of the total of the marks obtained by each
student. This total is the sum of the definitive marks gained by each
student in the sciences bearing on artillery, engineering, and mechanics
in connection with the art of war, for the talent displayed in drawing,
sketching, and writing memoirs, and for skill in practical exercises, as
determined by the results of the examination conducted by the jury of
examiners, added to the marks due to the previous classification in the
school, with the weight or influence equal to one-third of that allowed
for the examination by the jury.</p>

<p>The co-efficients of influence for the present year are&mdash;</p>

<p>So that the examination conducted by the jury of examiners exercises
an influence on the position of the students very nearly approaching to
two-thirds of the whole amount.</p>

<p>It is this final classification which determines their seniority in
the respective services. We were permitted to be present during the
examination, which was entirely oral, of two of the
<i>sous-lieutenants</i>, before the jury of examiners.</p>

<p>The questions were replied to with great fluency and readiness, but
it seemed to us that the examination was somewhat limited for the object
in view, viz., that of awarding a credit representing the progress which
each student had made in the particular science on which he had been
questioned, especially as that credit would have very great weight in
determining the candidate’s future position.<a class = "tag" name =
"tag1_14" id = "tag1_14" href = "#note1_14">14</a></p>

<p>On quitting the School of Application at Metz, the sub-lieutenants of
artillery and engineers respectively join the regiments, to which they
are then definitely assigned as second lieutenants, and continue to be
employed in doing duty, and in receiving practical instruction with
them, until they are promoted.</p>


<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page148" id = "page148">148</a></span>
<h4><a name = "metz_subsequent" id = "metz_subsequent" href =
"#special_metz">SUBSEQUENT INSTRUCTION AND EMPLOYMENT.</a></h4>

<p>The lieutenants of the artillery are employed on all duties that will
tend to make them efficient artillery officers, and fully acquainted
with all details connected with the drill, practice, and manœuvres of
the artillery, and also with the interior economy and discipline of a
regiment of artillery.</p>

<p>After the officers of artillery are promoted to the rank of second
captain, but not before, they are detached from their regiments and
successively sent into the various arsenals, cannon foundries, powder
mills, and small arm manufactories, pyrotechnic establishments, and
workshops, in order that they may become practically acquainted with the
whole of the processes connected with the manufacture and supply of
artillery, rockets, small arms, powder, material of all kinds, tools,
&amp;c., and also with the construction and repair of the buildings and
factories required for these purposes. Sometimes they are employed as
assistants in these establishments. The inspectors of the arms of
regiments are selected from among those who have become acquainted with
the manufacture of small arms.</p>

<p>When promoted to first captains they again rejoin their regiments, so
that they may not lose the qualifications and knowledge required from a
good practical artillery officer.</p>

<p>Field-officers of artillery are employed as superintendents and
directors, and captains as sub-directors, of the important works
intrusted to their arm.</p>

<p>In time of war, the officers of artillery have the construction of
their own batteries, and the direction of the ordnance in battles and
sieges, together with the formation of movable bridges and passages by
boats.</p>

<p>It must be noticed, in contradistinction to the practice which
prevails in England, that the artillery and engineer services
manufacture their own tools.</p>

<p>The young engineer officers are employed with the men of their
regiments, and with them pass through courses of practical instruction
in the field, in sapping, mining, field fortification, sham-sieges,
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page149" id = "page149">149</a></span>
bridges, and castrametation. During this practical instruction one of
the lieutenants belonging to each company is always present, and the
captain of the company visits the work once in the course of the
day.</p>

<p>The duties of the officers of engineers in time of peace are the
construction, preservation, and repairs of fortresses and military
buildings, and the command and instruction of the engineer soldiers.</p>

<p>In time of war, the officers of engineers are intrusted with the
construction of works of permanent fortification, of the general works
in the attack and defense of fortresses, and the reconnaissance
connected therewith.</p>

<p>They <i>may</i> also be charged&mdash;</p>

<p>With the construction of such works of field fortifications as the
commander-in-chief or the generals of division consider necessary; such
as <i>épaulments</i>, trenches, redoubts, forts, blockhouses,
bridgeheads, intrenched camps, as well as the opening of communications,
the establishment of bridges resting on fixed supports, and the
formation and destruction of roads.</p>

<p>After the officers of engineers have been promoted to the rank of
second captain, and not before, they are mostly employed apart from
their regiments, on the <i>état major</i> of the engineers in fortified
towns and places, either in charge of the existing military buildings
and fortifications, or with the duty of carrying on, or assisting to
carry on, such new works as are in course of construction from time to
time.</p>

<p>We have already stated that by the law in France one-third of the
officers of the army is obtained from the military schools; one-third
from the non-commissioned officers who have been raised to that grade
from the ranks; while the remaining third is placed at the disposal of
the supreme executive power. As regards the artillery and engineers this
last third is in actual practice obtained, like the first third part,
from the Polytechnic School, so that only one-third of the officers of
those arms are promoted from among the non-commissioned officers, and
these seldom rise above the rank of captain. Much attention is, however,
paid to the improvement of the education of these latter officers, and
we found that <i>four</i> officers of engineers and <i>one</i> officer
of artillery so promoted were, by order of the minister of war, on the
recommendation of the inspectors-general, passing through the School of
Application at Metz, the course of instruction for them being modified
on their account. And it was confidently expected that a large number of
those officers who
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page150" id = "page150">150</a></span>
had been promoted in this way during the war would be ordered to the
School of Application at Metz.</p>

<p>We should not omit to mention that occasional exchanges of service
take place, during the first year of residence at Metz, among the pupils
destined for the artillery, and those destined for the engineers.</p>

<p>The pay of officers of the artillery and of the engineers is the
same. A&nbsp;small additional allowance is granted to officers of
artillery when mounted.</p>


<h4><a name = "metz_regiment" id = "metz_regiment" href =
"#special_metz"><ins class = "correction"
title = "header supplied from table of contents">REGIMENTAL SCHOOLS.</ins></a></h4>

<p class = "smallhead">ARTILLERY REGIMENTAL SCHOOLS.</p>

<p>There are ten regimental artillery schools established in places or
towns that are usually garrisoned by the troops of this arm, and one of
these schools exists at Metz.</p>


<p class = "smallhead">ENGINEER REGIMENTAL SCHOOLS.</p>

<p>The soldiers of the engineers appear to be very well taught in their
regimental schools, of which there are three, one for each regiment,
established at Metz, Arras, and Montpellier, where the regiments are
usually in garrison. The strength of each regiment is 4,500 men.</p>

<p>The instruction given in these schools has for its object to afford,
to its full extent, to the officers, <i>sous-officiers</i>, and soldiers
of the engineers, the requisite theoretical and practical knowledge to
enable them satisfactorily to fulfill the duties of their various ranks,
and to qualify them for promotion to higher rank.</p>

<p>It is so regulated that at the end of the first year the men have
learnt the nature of the service and duties of a soldier; and that at
the close of the second year, the practiced sapper is cognizant of
mining, and the practical miner is acquainted with sapping.</p>

<p>In the lowest classes the men begin with learning to read and write;
this if followed by arithmetic, grammar, writing from dictation, and
composition. The next subjects are special mathematics, landscape, plan,
topographical and architectural drawing. We attended a class in which a
corporal of sappers was explaining to the mathematical teacher
(a&nbsp;civilian) the theory of the inclined plane, and we saw a large
number of their drawings, topographical and architectural, many of which
were very well executed.</p>

<p>The theoretical instruction is given between the months of November
and March, the practical instruction in the field, (already noticed)
occupies the rest of the year. The combined courses are completed in two
years.</p>

<p><span class = "firstword">The</span> chief Regulations for the Police
of the Establishment are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>I. <span class = "smallcaps">Barracks.</span>&mdash;The Students are
lodged in Barracks in the School, under the command of a Captain of the
Staff, with the title of Commandant of the Quarter. They take their
meals, however, out of the Barracks, in the town. They are allowed free
egress and ingress from and to their Barracks, from the call at 6 in the
morning to 10 at night, excepting during the hours devoted to lectures
and the studies in the rooms. During these hours they must give special
notice o£ their times of going out and coming in.</p>

<p>II. <span class = "smallcaps">Organization into Brigades and
Sections.</span>&mdash;Each Division is arranged in Brigades of thirty
Students at the utmost, and each Brigade in two sections. The Students
of Artillery and those of the Engineers constitute, as far as possible,
separate Brigades. A&nbsp;Captain of the Staff is attached to each
Brigade for its superintendence. The students in these Brigades and
Sections are arranged in the order of merit which they held on entrance,
and the first Student on the list of each Brigade and of each section of
a Brigade is called its Chief. This arrangement is preserved at their
messes, which are held at the Restaurateurs’, each section of fifteen
having its own table, and its chief being the head of the mess. Private
bills or private additions to the mess are forbidden, the maximum price
for the daily fare being fixed by the Commandant of the School.</p>

<p>III. <span class = "smallcaps">Conduct of the
Students.</span>&mdash;All games of chance are forbidden; and any debts
discovered are punished. If a Student continues long without paying
such, he is reported to the Minister of War.</p>

<p>IV. <span class = "smallcaps">Inspection of Work Done Within the
House.</span>&mdash;No work or drawing may be done out of the rooms of
study, except in cases of illness.</p>

<p>All works to be executed by the Students are considered as service
ordered to be done, which must be completed at the hours and within the
period fixed in the order of the day. Students who are in arrears of
work at the end of their first year are required to finish them during
the time of vacation.</p>

<p>V. <span class = "smallcaps">Superintendence of out-of-door
Work</span>.&mdash;After describing facilities afforded to the Students
for working in the country, and stating minutely the method to be
followed, the directions add that “on bringing back their plans,
Students must present their sketches, and all the notes taken by them,
in their rough state, to the Officer of the Staff intrusted to inspect
them. They can not begin to put their work into shape till this
Officer’s visa has been affixed to the sketches, notes,” &amp;c.</p>

<p>VI. <span class = "smallcaps">Vacation.</span>&mdash;There is one
vacation at the end of the first year. Any class, or any single student,
under punishment, may be deprived of this. Any work to which the
Professor gives a mark below 7, must be considered incomplete, and to be
done again. Students are kept up in vacation to finish their work; but
if it is done within fifteen days, and marked by the Professor’s visa,
they are allowed to go away for the rest of the vacation.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page152" id = "page152">152</a></span>
<p>Young Officers, after their final examination, are subject to all the
Regulations of the School, down to the moment of their leaving the
town.</p>


<h4><a name = "metz_note_value" id = "metz_note_value" href =
"#special_metz">II. REGULATIONS FOR ESTIMATING THE VALUE OF THE WORK
EXECUTED.</a></h4>

<p>The time devoted to each of the courses in the School, to the works
of every kind which belong to it, to the exercises, drill, theoretical
instructions, &amp;c., is fixed in accordance with programmes approved
by the Minister of War; and the Table similar to that given at pages
180&ndash;181, exhibiting the employment, is each year submitted for his
approbation by the Superior Council of the School.</p>

<p>Every kind of work, such as the out-door operations, sketches,
drawings, memoirs, calculations, interrogations, manipulations,
manœuvres, drill, &amp;c., is valued by the Professor or Officer of the
Staff charged with its direction, by the product of two numbers, one
representing the merit of its execution, and the other the importance of
the work.</p>

<p>The numbers representing the merit of the execution or instruction
are regulated by the scale of 0 to 20, as at the Polytechnic School.</p>

<p>The co-efficient of importance is found by dividing the number
representing the maximum value allowed for the execution of any work by
20, the maximum credit for merit; and the number representing the
maximum value, allowed for the execution of any work has reference to
all the circumstances bearing upon its execution. It is regulated by the
number of hours appropriated to its execution; and in estimating this
number of hours, regard is had, not only to the time occupied in making
the drawing, but also to that which is necessary for the calculations,
essays, and sketches indispensable to its execution. The lectures are
reckoned at one and a half hours, and the sittings in the Halls of Study
at four and a half hours.</p>

<p>The number of hours inserted in the Table giving the distribution of
the time employed, being insufficient for the composition of the
memoirs, specifications, estimates, &amp;c., the value given for this
kind of work, of which a great part is performed out of the Halls of
Study, is fixed at twice the number of hours inserted in the Table
showing the distribution of the time employed.</p>

<p>The interrogations are the subject of a special credit, the maximum
being equal to the number of hours devoted to the lectures, multiplied
by one and a half hour, the length of each lecture.</p>

<p>The credit given for a work performed outside the school is divided
into two parts: one, equal to one-third of the total credit, is in the
hands of the Officer charged with the superintendence of the work, who
estimates the zeal and aptitude of the student; the other, equal to
two-thirds, is applied by the Professor, and given according to the
merit of the work.</p>

<p>The sum of the credits, given for work of all kinds in a course of
study, forms the maximum credit for the course.</p>

<p>The method of fixing the credit for the execution of works, according
to the time devoted to them, is equally applicable to the exercises,
practice, and drill.</p>

<p>When the time granted for the execution of any work has expired, the
Director of Studies sends this work to the Professor for his
examination, who establishes the number or credit, showing its
importance, and returns it to the Director of Studies.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page153" id = "page153">153</a></span>
<p>Every work which has been finished and examined, is marked by the
Professor by a number representing its merit, which number may be
fractional.</p>

<p>This is multiplied by the number representing its importance, and the
nearest whole number resulting from this product expresses the value of
the examined work.</p>

<p>Every unfinished work receives a provisional value, and is then
returned to the person executing it, and as soon as it has been
completed a second evaluation is made, but only two-thirds of the
difference between the first and second evaluations is added to the
first; the same principle is applied to the works which have been valued
below seven, or to those which have been amended or recommenced.</p>

<p>Every work which has not been executed by the student is marked 0;
but the grounds for its non-execution are placed before the Jury of
Examination.</p>

<p>In the event of two papers being so similar that it is evident one
must have been copied from the other, and that it is not possible to
decide which has been copied from the other, both are marked 0.</p>

<p>And on the other hand, if it is proved that there was no complicity
between the authors of the two papers, the copied paper is the only one
canceled.</p>

<p>At the end of each year’s study, the Council of the School makes a
classification of the students of the two divisions.</p>

<p>Each of these classifications is formed of the following
elements:&mdash;</p>

<p>1st. Notes of conduct given by the General commanding and the Colonel
Second in Command.</p>

<p>2nd. Notes of appreciation given by the General Commanding, and the
Colonel Second in Command, and by the Officers of the Staff of the
School.</p>

<p>3rd. Tables of credits given by two Field Officers of the Artillery
and Engineers on the theoretical and practical instruction with which
they are charged.</p>

<p>4th. Tables of credits given by each Professor for the works of all
kinds, interrogations, &amp;c., of his course.</p>

<p>The classification of the first year comprehends all the works,
drill, and practice, executed during the first year, which have been
valued, as well as the notes of appreciation and of conduct.</p>

<p>The number appropriated to these notes at the end of the first year
is equal to the moiety of the total number allowed for the two years of
study.</p>

<p>The classification of the students of the second year presents the
reunion of the works executed by them since their entrance into the
school.</p>

<p>The maximum number of credits appropriated to all the Officers of the
Staff, as a note of appreciation, is equal to one-sixth of the total of
all the courses taken together.</p>

<p>The same number, divided into two equal parts, is assigned to the
notes of appreciation given by the General commanding and the Second in
Command.</p>

<p>Lastly, the notes of conduct given by the General commanding and the
Second in Command form one-fiftieth of the total value.</p>

<p>For the classification of each division the Director of Studies
abstracts into a Table, for each arm, all the elements which should
enter into this classification. Below the name of each student are
inserted all the credits which belong to him, and the total, reduced in
the ratio of the maximum 20, is the definitive number of the
classification of each student.</p>

<p>The Director of Studies appends to these Tables a report containing
everything which affords a means of estimating the work, the conduct of
each
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page154" id = "page154">154</a></span>
student, the delays, and the causes, &amp;c. In giving the names of the
students whose credits are less than 7, he proposes, conformably with
the Regulations, the measures that should be taken with regard to
them.</p>

<p>The Superior Council of the School being assembled, the different
Tables furnished by the Professors and by the Officers of the Staff, as
well as those in which they are summed up, are collated, and the list of
classifications for each division and for each arm is fixed separately,
with the definitive numbers representing the credits.</p>

<p>These classified lists indicate for each arm the new rank of the
Students, their rank at admission to the School of Application and of
passage to the first division, the sum of the values for the works
executed by them, and all the elements which would tend to enable a
proper judgment to be formed of their merits and conduct.</p>

<p>The Superior Council adds to it, if there be any necessity for it,
notes, exposing the grounds which have contributed to the principal
alterations in the relative position of the Student, and points out
those whose credit is less than 7, as well as those who by their bad
conduct deserve to become the object of exceptional measures.</p>


<p class = "heading"><i>Examination for Leaving.</i></p>

<p>Each year the General commanding the School determines by lot, at
least one month in advance, the order in which the examinations for the
promotions in the Artillery and Engineers are to take place. The
Students belonging to the same arm can change among themselves, but
eight days after the lots have been drawn the list of the order of
examination is definitely closed. The General commanding the School
makes known at the same period the order of the examinations and the
division of the subjects between these examinations.</p>

<p>The General commanding the School places before the General of
Division, President of the Jury of Examination, the
following:&mdash;</p>

<p>1st. The division of the subjects between the three examinations.</p>

<p>2nd. The order of examination of the Arms, and of the students of
each Arm.</p>

<p>3rd. The provisional classification of the students of the first
division made by the Superior Council.</p>

<p>4th. The particular reports relating to each student made by the
General commanding the School.</p>

<p>5th. The list of the propositions made by the Superior Council and
the proceedings of the sitting at which it was agreed to.</p>

<p>6th. The classification of the Students of the second Division.</p>

<p>7th. Tables of questions established for each course.</p>

<p>8th. The abstracts of the sittings of the Superior Council held since
the last examination.</p>

<p>The Student Sub-lieutenants are successively examined in all the
branches composing the theoretical and practical instruction of the
School. The theoretical knowledge is grouped in three series, each of
which is the object of a particular trial.</p>

<p>The drill and practice are executed in the presence of the Jury, who
cause the command to be given to the Sub-lieutenant, in order to satisfy
themselves of the amount of their instruction, and to assign marks of
merit to them individually.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page155" id = "page155">155</a></span>
<p>The subjects of the three examinations are divided in the following
manner:</p>

<p>First. Examination, made by the Field Officer of Artillery in
the&mdash;</p>

<div class = "in-text">
<p>Course of Military Art.</p>
<p>Course of Artillery.</p>
<p>Course of Veterinary Art.</p>
<p>Sham Siege (part relating to Artillery.)</p>
<p>Course of Military Law and Administration.</p>
</div>

<p>Second. Examination, held by the Field Officer of Engineers.</p>

<div class = "in-text">
<p>Course of Permanent Fortification and the Attack and Defense of
Places.</p>
<p>Course of Construction.</p>
<p>Sham Siege (part relating to the Engineering.)</p>
</div>

<p>Third. Examination, held by the third Examiner, taken either from the
Artillery or Engineers, in the&mdash;</p>

<div class = "in-text">
<p>Course of Mechanics.</p>
<p>Course of Applied Sciences.</p>
<p>Course of Topography and Geodesy.</p>
<p>German Language.</p>
</div>

<p>Every Student, on presenting himself before the Examiners, submits
for their approbation the drawings and manuscripts relating to the
subjects on which the examination is to bear. Independent of the
questions which are placed before him by the Examiners, the Student
Sub-lieutenant must reply to any objections or questions which the
members of the Jury may think fit to address to him.</p>

<p>The German Master directly questions the Students, if the Jury wish
it. The Professors or their Assistants must be present at the
examinations relating to their course.</p>

<p>As soon as the examination is ended, the members of the Jury retire
to an adjoining room with closed doors, to determine on the amount of
marks to be given to the Student examined.</p>

<p>When the trials of all kinds are finished, the Jury proceed to the
definitive classification of the Students belonging to each arm. In
making this classification, regard is had to the following
considerations:&mdash;</p>

<p>1st. Each examination has a co-efficient of importance equal to the
sum of all the different courses which are included in it.</p>

<p>2nd. The co-efficient of importance for drawing is equal to the 1/20
of the sum of the co-efficients of the three examinations.</p>

<p>3rd. The co-efficient of importance of the practice, drill, &amp;c.,
is, as for the courses, the sum of the co-efficients appropriated to the
works taught in the School.</p>

<p>By multiplying the co-efficients of importance by the mean number of
marks of merit obtained by the Students in the different examinations,
the definitive credit which must be assigned to each Student in the
Table of Classification is obtained.</p>

<p>The classification of the School enters into the definitive
classification for a value equal to one-third of the total number of the
three examinations, without comprising the valuation of the drawings;
this value is added to the credits determined above.</p>

<p>The Jury give an account of the proceedings of the examinations in a
“<i>procès-verbal</i>” addressed to the Minister by the General acting
as President.</p>

<p>The tracing of batteries is executed by the students of both arms,
the other tasks by the artillery students alone.</p>


<p class = "smallhead">I. DRAWING ORDNANCE (12 DAYS.)</p>

<p>The survey of ordnance consists in constructing accurate sketches of
a gun, howitzer, and mortar, in measuring their dimensions, and in
giving a description of each of the pieces drawn. It is on this occasion
that the students are practiced in the management of instruments to
insure precision, such as the <i>étoile mobile</i>, and the sliding
compass, &amp;c. One day is devoted to this work.</p>

<p>The tracing of ordnance consists in the execution of a drawing upon
colombier paper, containing an exact and detailed representation of a
gun, a howitzer, and a mortar, with their projectiles.</p>

<p>This work is performed with the help of the tables for the
construction of ordnance. Eleven days are devoted to it.</p>


<p class = "heading"><i>Detailed Programme of the Drawing.</i></p>

<p>1. For each gun, howitzer, or mortar, a longitudinal section in the
direction of the axis, and at right angles to the axis of the trunnions,
and a plan parallel to the axis of the bore and of the trunnions.</p>

<p>Besides this, for those cannon and howitzers which have dolphins, a
transverse section taken across the middle of the dolphins and the axis
of the trunnions. For mortars, a transverse section made by a plane
passing in front of the dolphins, the whole on a scale of one-fifth.</p>

<p>2. Detail of the button (comprising the cascable and breeching loop
for naval ordnance) on a scale of two-fifths.</p>

<p>3. Detail of the tracing of a dolphin, on the scale of
two-fifths.</p>

<p>4. Tracing of the bush of a gun, on a scale of two-fifths, and
tracing of a priming-pan at the real size.</p>

<p>5. For garrison ordnance, in cast-iron, detail of the widening of the
base ring on a scale of two-fifths.</p>

<p>6. Tracing of a cannon-ball, of a howitzer-shell, and of a shell, on
a scale of one-fifth.</p>

<p>Tracing of the lugs of a shell, ring and lug at the real size.</p>

<p>All the parts of the drawing must be colored in uniform tints in
conformity to the table of conventional colors; the annexation of the
figures of measurement is not required.</p>

<p>This work is preceded by three or four lectures intended to make the
students familiar with the tracings which they have to execute, and the
solution of the problems in geometry and descriptive geometry, to which
the representation on paper of pieces of ordnance and their projectiles
give rise.</p>


<p class = "smallhead">II. DESIGN FOR ORDNANCE (24 DAYS.)</p>

<p>The design for ordnance has for its object the complete determination
of the nature of a projectile, and of a piece of ordnance in accordance
with certain special conditions, inquiring into the laws of the motion
of the projectile, and into its principal destructive effects, and the
settlement of practice-tables for the
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page176" id = "page176">176</a></span>
gun. The general case for treatment is that of a howitzer, which
comprehends the gun and the mortar as particular cases.</p>

<p>The data usually adopted are,&mdash;</p>

<div class = "inlist">
<p>1. For the projectile, its weight and the quantity of powder which it
is capable of containing.</p>

<p>2. For the piece, the initial velocity of its projectile. This
operation comprises calculations, a drawing, and a memoir.</p>
</div>

<p>The drawing, on colombier paper, which must be figured in all its
parts, contains,&mdash;</p>

<div class = "inlist">
<p>1. The tracing of the profile of the piece, as it is determined by
calculation, so as to satisfy the different conditions of resistance, on
a scale of one-fifth.</p>

<p>2. The complete tracing of the piece executed in conformity with the
rules laid down for the tracing of ordnance on a scale of one-fifth.</p>

<p>3. Tracing of the projectile on a scale of one-fifth.</p>

<p>4. Tracing of the wooden bottom and of the fuse of the projectile,
executed in the case of each of these objects in two figures&mdash;the
one on a large scale (two-thirds, or even the size of nature,)
representing the inquiry into their forms and dimensions, the other
giving on a scale of one-fifth the results of this inquiry. To this is
added, for the mountain howitzer, or any other howitzer for which it is
admissible, a tracing of the mounted howitzer carriage.</p>

<p>5. The representation in drawing of the laws of the motion of the
projectile, the trajectory, inclinations, remaining velocities,
durations of the passage.</p>

<p>In addition, the scale of the elevations and that of the angles of
fire, for an object of aim placed at different distances.</p>

<p>6. An inscription showing all the essential elements by which the
projectile and the piece are distinguished.</p>
</div>

<p>The final tracings of the gun, the projectile, the bottom, and the
fuse, must be colored in uniform tints conformably to the table of
conventional colors.</p>

<p>As to the tracing of the profile founded upon the calculation, it
should receive merely an edging of the color which represents the metal
used.</p>

<p class = "smallhead">III. APPLICATION OF THE THEORIES OF THE ARTILLERY
COURSE (6 DAYS.)</p>

<p>This study is intended to apply to the students those theories of the
course which have not found their application in the design for
ordnance. It comprises the solution by arithmetical calculations of
certain questions on the effects of powder, the balistic pendulum, the
effects of recoil, the science of projectiles, the draught of carriages,
&amp;c. The number of the questions may vary according to their nature
and the time which their solution requires. The stating of the questions
and the results of the calculations are inscribed on separate papers.
This study is preceded by a lesson in which the students have recalled
to them the formulas which they have to employ.</p>


<p class = "smallhead">IV. DRAWING OF ARTILLERY MATERIAL (26 DAYS.)</p>

<p>The drawing of artillery material has for its object the
representation by figured sketches of a gun-carriage, carriage, or other
furniture of artillery material. The sketches, on paper put together in
the form of a book, and headed by a special programme for the object to
be drawn, consist of plans, sections, or elevations of the object,
executed on certain scales, and of detailed projections of the principal
iron-work and joints. The whole fixed by the special programme in
question.</p>

<p>All the simultaneous projections of any one part of the object drawn
(fore part or hind part for carriages) must be completely figured; they
are accompanied by explanatory inscriptions, with letters of reference
to show the names of the pieces in wood or metal which they
comprise.</p>

<p>Each collection of sketches must contain as well a notice in
confirmation of the drawing, giving the complete description and the
properties of the object to which it refers.</p>

<p>The students make two surveys of the same kind; eight days are
allowed for each of these surveys, including the composition of the
confirmatory notice.</p>

<p>The first survey is followed by the execution of an unfigured
drawing, containing a complete representation of the object surveyed
(elevation and plan,) obtained by the combination of the partial
projections contained in the sketch. The drawing should be colored in
the conventional uniform tints, and accompanied by an explanatory
inscription, with letters of reference. Ten days are devoted to this
work of composition.</p>


<p class = "smallhead">V. TRACING OF BATTERIES (4 DAYS.)</p>

<p>This work consists in executing sketches showing, each in accordance
with a separate programme, the complete plan of a battery and the
essential data having reference to its construction and to its armament.
The sketches, made by scale and completely figured, must comprise in the
case of each battery to be represented&mdash;</p>

<div class = "inlist">
<p>1. The general plan of the battery, on the scale of 1/200.</p>

<p>2. The sections or elevations necessary for the understanding of this
plan, including the detail of the powder magazines, lines of
communication, &amp;c., on the scale of 1/100.</p>

<p>3. An inscription giving the object of the battery, its armament, its
general arrangement (<i>terre-plein</i>, embrasures, revetment,
communications,
<span class = "pagenum">

magazines, &amp;c.,) the workmen, materials, and tools necessary for its
construction, and finally the duration of the labor and its distribution
by day and night.</p>

<p>Four days are devoted to this work, which must be executed on a half
sheet of colombier paper. The separate programmes relating to each of
these batteries are shown on the study orders of the rooms.</p>

<p class = "heading"><i>Programme of the Project of Field
Fortification.</i></p>

<p>This project is made by the Sub-Lieutenants, according to certain
data given to each of them. It has for its object to cause them to
study:&mdash;1st. The trace. 2d. The complete organization necessary for
its defense. 3d. The details of construction of a field-work. In
consequence, the work comprises three Plates of Drawings and a Memoir
divided into three parts.</p>


<p class = "heading"><i>Programme of the Drawings.</i></p>

<p>Plate 1.&mdash;Plan of the whole. This plate has for its object the
research of a trace and of a combination of suitable works for the
fortification of a certain portion of ground under certain circumstances
of war defined by particular data. Each Sub-Lieutenant receives a
lithographed sheet representing the ground to be fortified, and he has
to exhibit on this sheet the works he proposes, in tracing in plain
lines the horizontal projections of the interior crests and superior
limits of the ditch, and in dotted lines the stockades or palisades; to
show in black figures at the angles of the works the relief of the
interior crests; the sites of barbettes, embrasures, traverses,
barriers, &amp;c., being indicated by reference letters and explanatory
notes, the lines in red showing the directions and objects of the line
of fire.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page186" id = "page186">186</a></span>
<p>Plate 2.&mdash;Organization of a work.</p>

<p>This plate has for its object the study of the details of the
interior and exterior organization of a work of a certain form, in order
to render it susceptible of making a good defense.</p>

<p>Each Sub-Lieutenant will draw a complete plan of such one of the
works shown on Plate 1, as may be pointed out by the Professor. He will
represent the ditches, parapets, embrasures, accessory defenses, small
entrenchments, descents into the ditch, &amp;c., according to the
particular data furnished to him; the figures of the relief of the
crests of all kinds, the deblais and remblais being marked at all the
angles. The figures of the natural ground will be underlined. The same
plate will contain figured profiles which have served for the
determination of the complete projection of the work. Scale 1/250.</p>

<p>Plate 3.&mdash;Details of construction.</p>

<p>The object of this plate is to show the composition of workshops and
the manner that should be adopted in the construction of field-works,
according to circumstances, for the execution of the deblais and
remblais.</p>

<p>Each Sub-Lieutenant will indicate the manner in which the work drawn
on Plate 2 should be constructed:&mdash;1st. To render it durable and
solid. 2d. To arrive rapidly at a useful result, even with limited
resources of workmen and tools. 3d. To finish the work in the shortest
possible time, by making use of all the necessary means. A&nbsp;plan
will show the composition of the workshops under each of these
hypotheses, and the successive advancement of the work will be
represented by certain profiles supposed to be made at certain periods
of the construction through the center of one of the faces of the work.
In these profiles a firm trace, figured with altitudes, will show the
limits of the deblais and remblais at the period represented by the
profiles; and in addition by dotted lines, the final results proposed to
be obtained. All these projects must be accompanied by a figured plan,
showing the principal altitudes in meters. The remblais will be colored
with gamboge, the undisturbed earth in bistre, and the deblais will be
left white.</p>


<p class = "heading"><i>Programme of the Memoir.</i></p>

<p>Each Sub-Lieutenant will write at the head of his Memoir the text of
the particular programme, to which he is obliged to conform in the
preparation of his project, and he should add to the text of the Memoir
all the sketches properly figured, which are necessary for the proper
appreciation of the dispositions which are not sufficiently detailed on
the Drawings.</p>

<p>The Memoir is divided into three parts, corresponding to the three
Plates of Drawings.</p>


<p class = "smallhead">FIRST PART.&mdash;CONSIDERATIONS RESPECTING THE
WHOLE PROJECT.</p>

<h5><a name = "metz_fortif_ext" id = "metz_fortif_ext" href =
"#metz_fortif">III. PROGRAMME OF EXTERIOR WORKS.</a></h5>

<p>These works consist of an exercise in tracing out a camp, and an
exercise on the profiling and defilement of field-works.</p>

<p>The exercise on tracing camps has no particular programme, but is
preceded by a lecture given by the Professor.</p>


<p class = "heading"><i>Programme of Practical Exercises on the
Defilement and Profiling of Field Works.</i></p>

<p>This exercise comprehends: 1st, work on the ground; 2d, a Memoir.</p>

<p>The work on the ground has for its object: 1st, the trace of the
projections of the interior crest of a work, whose position and form are
known; 2d, the determination of the relief of the interior crest; 3d,
the profiling of the different parts, so that the relief of the
different parts of the parapet, barbettes, traverses, &amp;c., may all
be fixed.</p>

<p>The Sub-Lieutenants for this kind of work are divided into groups of
six or eight, employed together on the same work, each group being
divided into two squads. The work may be a lunette or a redan of given
dimensions, having a
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page188" id = "page188">188</a></span>
parapet of three meters thick, and a natural slope of one to one.</p>

<p>1st. The direction of the capital will be marked out in front by two
numbered pickets.</p>

<p>2d. The tracing will be executed by means of poles or pickets placed
at all the angles, and at the extremities of the gorge; the relief will
be determined by the practical methods of defilement adverted to in the
lecture which preceded the work.</p>

<p>3d. The relief obtained by the defilement will be marked on all the
poles or pickets placed at the angles, and at the extremities of the
sides of the work.</p>

<p>4th. On each face two vertical profiles will be executed,
perpendicular to the horizontal projections of its interior crest. In
order that these profiles shall not interfere with those placed at the
angles, they must be established at several meters distant from the
extremity of each face.</p>

<p>5th. The profiles of the angles will be deducted by simple
prolongations, and the same for the profiles of the gorge. If the
homologous crests of two contiguous faces do not meet each other, they
should be reconciled by joining two points taken on each of them at half
a meter from the intersection of their projections.</p>

<p>6th. On the traverse, designed to secure the defenders from a reverse
fire, two profiles are constructed, near to its extremities if its crest
is a right line, but if it is bent, another profile must be set up at
the junction.</p>

<p>7th. The data of all these profiles are, the relief of the interior
crest at the point where it is encountered by the profile, the thickness
of the parapet, the constant parts of every profile, and the natural
slope of the ground; the portion of the slope of the traverses exposed
to the view of the dominant heights should not be reveted, the others
should be.</p>

<p>8th. At the points of intersection of the profiles with the
projections of the ridges of the works, as well as at the points used
for adjusting, poles or pickets are placed, on which the points
belonging to the ridges are marked. These points will be joined together
in each profile by twine, indicating the different planes of the
work.</p>

<p>9th. The form and dimensions of the batteries, either of barbettes or
embrasures, will be equally determined by poles or pickets placed at all
their angles, and united together by twine in the manner that will be
subsequently explained.</p>

<p>10th. For the barbette batteries, the first thing to be done is to
establish and to construct the front coupé of the salient of the
interior crest, and substitute an interior horizontal crest throughout
the extent of the barbette for that situated in the plane of defilement.
The necessary adjustments are then made between the slope of the parapet
of the barbette and that of the rest of the face, and indicate by means
of twine the intersections of the terre-plein of the barbette and of its
slope with the different planes of the work.</p>

<p>11th. For the embrasures, after having determined their direction,
the intersections of the cheeks and bottom, with the interior and
exterior slope of the parapet, and with its slope; also the slope which
terminates the interruption of the banquette throughout the extent of
the battery. In the case where the platform is formed more than
0<sup>m</sup> 4 elevated above the soil, a ramp is constructed with its
slope, and the intersections with the slope from the platform are
shown.</p>

<p>12th. After the batteries, the slope of the ends of the traverses and
of the passages for entry and exit are constructed.</p>

<p>13th. The traverse will be finished by adjusting its different planes
with
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page189" id = "page189">189</a></span>
those of the parapet. In the particular case, where it was interfered
with to make a passage over the banquette, it is finished by reveting
the slope passing by the crest of the banquette of the work.</p>

<p>14th. At the passages of entry and exit from the work, the parapets
will be finished by the slope of the revetment, whose intersections with
the different planes of the parapets must be determined.</p>

<p>15th. For each squad of workmen, the distance of the salient of the
work to the point on which it will be defiladed must be determined.</p>

<p class = "smallhead">MEMOIR.</p>

<p>1st. Object of defilement&mdash;which is considered to be dangerous
ground, dangerous point, plane of defilement.</p>

<p>2d. Position of the dangerous point relatively to the work which is
to be defiladed. Practical method on the ground. Results to which it
leads.</p>

<p>3d. On the field this method is not always applicable to an isolated
work, and never is so to entrenchments of a great development, such as
lines, large têtes-de-pont, &amp;c. By what proceeding is it generally
expedient to attempt to fulfill in war the indisputable condition of
defilement.</p>

<p>The first part contains a description of the various works of
permanent fortification, their respective uses, and the changes that
have been successively made in them, together with a short history of
ancient fortification prior to the invention of powder, and the changes
introduced by the use of fire-arms.</p>

<p>The systems of Errard, Beville, Pagan, Vauban, Cochorn, and
Cormontaigne.</p>

<p>The first section of the second part describes the principles on
which the various parts of a front of fortification on level ground, and
according to Cormontaigne’s system, are regulated, such as the command,
relief, defilement, form, length, and material of which the various
parts should be constructed; the modifications required by the absence
or presence of water; the changes which are necessary as regards
exterior or advanced works, and ending with a comparison of a front of
fortification according to Cormontaigne, with a modification of the same
system introduced by the French engineers.</p>

<p>The second section commences with the principles of defilement and
its application under various given circumstances, proceeds with the
description of an imaginary work founded on certain given data, and
furnishes the data of its proposed construction. It then supplies the
theory relating to mines, and their use in the attack, defense, and
destruction of places, and points out the particular duties of engineers
in fortified places, and the proper and most efficient manner of
carrying them on.</p>

<p>The third section relates to the preparation of projects for the
improvement of inefficiently fortified places, and to the utility,
particular organization, and proper position of fortified places on a
frontier line. It then explains the necessity for military law in
providing for the security of fortified places and districts along the
frontiers of a state.</p>

<p>The third part describes the various operations connected with the
attack and defense of a bastioned fortification, commencing with the
operations preliminary to the siege and investment of the place, and
continuing to describe the
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page191" id = "page191">191</a></span>
several processes to be employed in the attack of the place, with the
corresponding efforts that should be made during its defense, and ending
with an historical account of certain sieges.</p>

<h4><a name = "metz_topo" id = "metz_topo" href = "#special_metz"><b>VI.
PROGRAMME OF THE COURSE OF TOPOGRAPHY.</b></a></h4>

<p>The course of Topography comprehends two parts.</p>

<p>The first relates to the art of topographical drawing, and the second
to the art of making topographical surveys. Both parts are carried on
<i>pari passu</i>; but as the order in which the different branches of
the instruction can be given depends very much on the other works
carried on in the School, it will be more convenient to give the
programme for each separately.</p>


<p class = "smallhead">FIRST PART.&mdash;INSTRUCTION IN TOPOGRAPHICAL
DRAWING.</p>

<p>The instruction in topographical drawing comprehends lectures and
exercises in graphical representation. It is based on a complete
exposition of the conventional principles of this species of drawing,
and it is illustrated by engraved examples of the characteristics
adopted for the representation of the various details.</p>


<p class = "heading"><i>First Section.&mdash;Lectures.</i></p>

<p>The lectures have for their object the explanation of the general
principles of the instruction in topographical drawing, and the
geometrical conditions which should regulate the shading of maps and
their reduction. They immediately precede the exercise to which they
relate.</p>

<p>Lecture 1 relates to small maps, copies, and reductions of these; and
it explains the object of topographical maps, the various kinds and the
different scales generally used. The manner in which the form of the
ground is represented by equi-distant contour or level lines is also
explained, and mention is made of the conventional tints used, and the
species of writing and value of the scale employed.</p>

<p>Lectures 2 and 3 relate to the execution of shaded plans by the brush
and the pen, under different circumstances of light and shade.</p>

<p>Lecture 4 explains the different methods for reducing topographical
maps, also the description, mode of using, and verification of
pentagraphs.</p>


<p class = "heading"><i>Second Section.&mdash;Exercises.</i></p>

<p>These exercises are intended to teach the students the conventional
signs used in topographical drawing, and to give them facilities with
the pencil and brush for producing shaded maps, and in reducing them
from one scale to another.</p>


<p class = "smallhead">SECOND PART.&mdash;INSTRUCTION IN TOPOGRAPHICAL
SURVEYING.</p>

<p>This instruction comprises:</p>

<div class = "inlist">
<p>1st. Lectures given in amphitheatre.</p>
<p>2d. Practical lectures or exercises.</p>
<p>3d. The execution of topographical surveys.</p>
</div>

<p class = "heading"><i>First Section.&mdash;Oral Lectures.</i></p>

<p>These lectures are divided in two classes, which
comprehend:&mdash;</p>

<div class = "inlist">
<p>1st. Those relating to the description of the instruments, and of the
methods used in topography.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page195" id = "page195">195</a></span>
<p>2d. Those which have reference to the manner in which the students
should proceed in the execution of the work, and principally of surveys
of limited extent.</p>
</div>

<p>Eight lectures are devoted to the description of the various
instruments, the method of adjusting their errors, and the manner of
using them, as well as to the different ways of proceeding in
topography; touching also on the various modes of measuring distances,
with descriptions of the compass, plane table, and instruments used for
leveling, and on the taking observations for and preparation of
sections, and the orientation of maps.</p>

<p>Four preparatory lectures are given, showing the manner in which the
students should proceed when on the ground to make a survey of small
extent.</p>

<p>Two lectures relate to the methods that should be employed in making
a survey of considerable extent, and on the appropriate scales.</p>

<p>Two lectures on military reconnaissance plans; instruments and scales
employed.</p>

<p>Two preparatory lectures relate to the execution of a reconnaissance
plan, in which the operations of a sham siege are intended to be
recorded.</p>


<p class = "heading"><i>Second Section.&mdash;Practical Lectures or
Exercises.</i></p>

<p>The object of these lectures, which take place on the glacis of the
fortification, is to show the students the practical modes of using the
instruments, and the precautions which must be taken, together with the
most elementary proceedings in topography. They are given to ten or
twelve students at the same time, and the Professor is assisted by an
officer of the staff. Each lecture lasts two and a half hours.</p>


<p class = "heading"><i>Third Section.&mdash;On the Execution of
Topographical Surveys.</i></p>

<p>The object is to familiarize the students with the use of the
principal instruments and the principal operations, and they comprehend
out-of-door work, of which the results are sketches, registers, and
minutes made in pencil, and in the construction of plans, and inking in
of the minutes in the Halls of Study.</p>

<p>The out-of-door work is performed under the superintendence of
officers of the staff, who assist the students in their work. The
construction of the plans is not commenced until the pencil minutes have
been examined by the Professor.</p>

<p>These exercises comprise:&mdash;</p>

<div class = "inlist">
<p>1st and 2d. Construction of plans by the aid of the compass.</p>
<p>3d. The plan of a fortification made with the plane table.</p>
<p>4th. The determination of the variation of the compass.</p>
<p>5th. The execution of a second survey by the aid of the compass.</p>
<p>6th. <span class = "dittomark">The execution of a</span> rapid survey
by pacing the distances.</p>
<p>7th. <span class = "dittomark">The execution of a</span>
reconnaissance survey.</p>
<p>8th. <span class = "dittomark">The execution of a</span> an itinerary
and reconnaissance sketch.</p>
<p>9th. The preparation of a plan on which the whole of the operations
of a sham siege may be laid down, as the works of attack and defense
proceed.</p>

"#special_metz">VII. PROGRAMME OF THE COURSE OF GEODESY AND
DIALLING.</a></h4>

<p>This course is divided into two parts&mdash;the one part special for
the engineers, and the other common to the artillery and engineers.</p>

<p>The first comprises:&mdash;</p>

<div class = "inlist">
<p>1st. The study of the execution of a triangulation of some extent,
and of its connection with the general triangulation of France, executed
under the superintendence of the Dépôt de la Guerre, and</p>

<p>2d. Leveling with the barometer.</p>
</div>

<p>The second contains:&mdash;</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>1st. The study of reflecting instruments.</p>

<p>2d. The principles of dialling.</p>
</div>

<p>Each of these parts comprehend:&mdash;</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>1st. Lectures given in the amphitheatre.</p>

<p>2d. Practical lectures or exercises.</p>

<p>3d. An application.</p>
</div>


<h5><a name = "metz_geodesy_eng" id = "metz_geodesy_eng" href =
"#metz_geodesy">FIRST PART.&mdash;SPECIAL FOR ENGINEERS.</a></h5>

<p>1st Section&mdash;Lectures.</p>

<p>These Lectures include:&mdash;</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>1st. A description of the principal geodesical instruments.</p>

<p>2d. The establishment of the triangulation.</p>

<p>3d. The survey and the calculations connected with it.</p>

<p>4th. The orientation of the triangulation.</p>

<p>5th. The calculation of the co-ordinates of the points and their
construction from the minutes of the survey.</p>

<p>6th. The geodesical and barometrical leveling.</p>
</div>

<p>The first lecture is devoted to the explanation of the different kind
of signals used under various circumstances; on the method of measuring
bases and angles, and the principles on which these operations are
performed; and concluding with the description and mode of using certain
instruments for measuring angles.</p>

<p>The second lecture continues and enlarges on the subject of the
measurement of angles, horizontal and vertical, with different kinds of
instruments.</p>

<p>The third lecture relates to the corrections and reductions which
must be made to observed angles, such as the correction for the
eccentricity of the instruments, to the reduction of the angles to the
horizon, and to the center of the station, and also on the adjustments
of the instruments, or the application of corrections for certain
errors.</p>

<p>The fourth lecture discusses the calculation of the triangles and
their errors, and points out the best organization that can be given to
the triangulation, and the exactitude which can be expected from it.</p>

<p>The fifth lecture also relates to the calculation and the development
of the triangulation, and explains the nature of the geodesical
operations for the map of France.</p>

<p>The sixth lecture explains the manner of observing for, and
determination of the azimuthal bearing, for the orientation of the
triangulation.</p>

<p>The seventh lecture has reference to the convergence of meridians,
calculation of rectangular co-ordinates, sundry problems, and geodesical
leveling.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page198" id = "page198">198</a></span>
<p>The eighth lecture shows in what manner the barometer is made use of
for the determination of differences of altitude, the nature of the
corrections to be applied to the instrument, and the degree of
exactitude to be found in the results of this process.</p>

<p>The ninth lecture points out the order in which geodesical
calculations should be performed and the verifications which should be
exacted.</p>

<p>The Second Section contains five lectures or exercises, and they have
for their object to familiarize the students with the use of the various
kinds of instruments employed in carrying on the operations which have
been shortly described in the first section.</p>

<p>The Third Section relates to the practical application of the
preceding principles, and mostly consists of geodesical
applications.</p>


<h5><a name = "metz_geodesy_common" id = "metz_geodesy_common" href =
"#metz_geodesy">SECOND PART.&mdash;COMMON TO THE ARTILLERY AND
ENGINEERS.</a></h5>

<p>The First Section consists of lectures given in the amphitheatre, and
relates to reflecting instruments, such as the sextant, reflecting
circle, and the method of using them, and also on the principles of
dialling, and its connection with various problems in astronomy;
describes also the different kinds of dials.</p>


<p class = "smallhead">SECOND SECTION.&mdash;PRACTICAL EXERCISES.</p>

<p>In which the students are called upon, in the presence of the
Professor, to adjust the sextant, and to use it in connection with an
artificial horizon for the measurement of the angle between any two
objects of the altitude of these objects above the horizon, and also the
same altitude.</p>

<p>Third Section contains the practical application of the principles
enunciated in the preceding sections, in the preparation by the students
of two drawings, in which they will exhibit the graphical representation
of the hour in terms of the altitude of the sun previously observed, and
show the various constructions of a sun-dial, according to the specified
conditions based on the observation of the hour angle.</p>

interfere with the current work in the halls. The first excursion will
have for its object the study of the lias and lower oolite, met with in
the vicinity of Metz. If the time will admit of it, a reconnaissance
will be made to the great oolite at Taumont or at Amanvillers.</p>

<p>The second excursion will be made in the direction of Gorze for the
study of the lower oolitic formation and to trace it up to Bradford
clay, where an important fault occurs in this direction near to Metz.
The study of this fault will be the great object of this excursion.</p>

<p>The third excursion will be made in the direction of Forbach, meeting
with the lias, chalk-colored freestone, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Three entire days will be devoted to these excursions, and each
Sub-Lieutenant will enter his observations in a note-book, and make a
certain number of

<p>The instruction on horseback can, under certain circumstances, be
considered as connected with this course; and questions are asked during
the time when the sub-lieutenants are not engaged in actual riding
exercise. This instruction is described under the head of Practical
Military Instruction; it comprises at the maximum 272 attendances, and
its credit of influence is valued at 240.</p>

"#france_special">ARTILLERY AND ENGINEERS’ REGIMENTAL SCHOOLS.</a></h3>

<h4><a name = "special_reg_art" id = "special_reg_art" href =
"#special_reg">I. ARTILLERY REGIMENTAL SCHOOLS.</a></h4>

<p>These are intended for the theoretical and practical instruction of
officers, <i>sous-officiers</i>, and gunners.</p>

<p>Each School is under the orders of the General of Brigade commanding
the Artillery in the military division in which it is situated.</p>

<p>Independent of the general officer, the school has the following
staff:&mdash;</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>A Lieutenant (associated assistant to the General.)</p>
<p>A Professor of Sciences, applying more particularly to the
Artillery.</p>
<p>A Professor of Fortification, of drawing, and construction of
buildings.</p>
<p>Two <i>Gardes</i> of Artillery (one of the first, and the other of
the second class.)</p>
</div>

<p>There are, in addition, attached to each school the number of
inferior officers (captains, lieutenants, or <i>sous-lieutenants</i>)
required for carrying on the theoretical courses, which are not placed
under the direction of the professors.</p>

<p>A captain of the first class, assisted by two first lieutenants, is
the director of the park of the school. Another captain, also of the
first class, but taken from the regiment of Pontooneers, has the
direction of that portion of the bridge equipage necessary for the
special instruction of this corps, as well as of the material of the
artillery properly belonging to this instruction.</p>

<p>The lieutenant-colonel, assistant to the general, fulfills,
independent of every other detail of supervision with which he may be
charged, the functions of <i>ordonnateur secondaire</i>, in what
concerns the expenses of the school and their propriety
(<i>justification</i>.) He corresponds with the minister of war for this
part of the service.</p>

<p>The instruction is divided into <i>theoretical</i> and
<i>practical</i>, and the annual course is divided into half-yearly
periods, or into summer and winter instructions.</p>

<p>The summer instruction commences, according to different localities,
from the 1st of April to the 1st of May, and that of the winter from the
1st of October to the 1st of November.</p>

<p>The winter and summer instruction is subdivided into school and
regimental instruction.</p>

<p>The school instruction comprehends all the <i>theoretical</i> and
<i>practical</i> instruction common to the different corps which require
the
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page222" id = "page222">222</a></span>
assistance of the particular means of the school, the employment of its
professors, locality, and material, as that of the practical instruction
in which the troops belonging to the different corps of the army are
united to take part.</p>

<p>The regimental instruction is that which exists in the interior of
the regiments and the various bodies of the artillery. It is directed by
the chiefs of these corps, who are responsible for it, with the means
placed at their disposal, under the general surveillance of the
commandant of the school.</p>

<p>The special instruction of the Pontooneers not admitting of their
following the same instruction as the other regiments of artillery, the
chief of this corps directs the special instruction according to certain
bases prescribed by the regulations.</p>

<p>There are for the captains of artillery, each year during the winter
half-year, six conferences for the purposes of considering and
discussing projects for the organization of different equipages and
armaments for the field service, and for attack and defense of
places.</p>

<p>In a building belonging to each school of artillery, under the name
of the hotel of the school, are united the halls and establishments
necessary for the theoretical instruction of the officers and
sous-officers, such as halls for <i>théorique</i> drill and drawing,
library, depots of maps and plans, halls for machines, instruments and
models, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Each school is provided with a physical cabinet and a chemical
laboratory. There is also a piece of ground, called a polygon, for
exercising artillerymen to the manœuvers of cannon and other firearms of
great range. Its extent is sufficient in length to furnish a range of
1,200 meters, and in breadth of 600 meters.</p>

<p>Permanent and temporary batteries are established on this ground, and
they seem not only for practice, but also to accustom the men to the
construction of fascines, field batteries, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The administration of each school, and the accounts relating to it,
are directed by an administrative council, consisting of&mdash;</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>The General Officer commanding the Artillery (President.)</p>

<p>The Colonels of the regiments of Artillery in the towns where two
regiments of the Artillery are quartered, and in other towns, the
Colonel and Lieutenant-Colonel of the regiment.</p>

<p>The Colonel of the regiment of Pontooneers in the town where the
principal part of the corps may be stationed, and in any other town the
Lieutenant-Colonel or the Major.</p>

<p>The Lieutenant-Colonel associated assistant with the General
Commandant.</p>
</div>

<p>The functions of secretary of the council are intrusted to a
<i>grade</i> of the first class.</p>

<p>The functionaries of the corps of intendants fulfill, in connection
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page223" id = "page223">223</a></span>
with the administrative councils of the artillery schools, the same
duties as are assigned by the regulations relating to the interior
administration of bodies of troops. They will exercise over the
accounts, both of money and material of the said schools, the same
control as over the administration connected with the military interests
of the state.</p>


<h4><a name = "special_reg_eng" id = "special_reg_eng" href =

<p>The colonel of each regiment has the superior direction of the
instruction.</p>

<p>The lieutenant-colonel directs and superintends, under his orders,
the whole of the details of the regimental instruction.</p>

<p>A major, selected from among the officers of this rank belonging to
the <i>état-major</i> of this arm, directs and superintends, under the
orders of the colonel, the whole of the details of the special
instruction.</p>

<p>The complete instruction consists of&mdash;</p>

<p>General instruction, or that of the regiment, by which a man is made
a soldier.</p>

<p>Special or school instruction, having for its object the training of
the miner or sapper.</p>

<p>The instructions are each separated into <i>theoretical</i> and
<i>practical</i> instruction.</p>

<p>The theoretical instruction of the regiment comprehends the
theories:&mdash;</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>On the exercises and manœuvers of infantry. On the interior service.
On the service of the place. On field service. On the maintenance of
arms. On military administration. On military penal legislation.</p>
</div>

<p>The practical instruction of the regiment comprises:&mdash;</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>The exercises and manœuvers of infantry. Practice with the musket.
Military Marches. Fencing.</p>
</div>

<p>The teaching of these various duties is confided to officers,
<i>sous-officiers</i>, and corporals of the regiments, as pointed out by
the regulation, and the orders of the colonel.</p>

<p>The fencing school is organized in a similar manner to those of the
infantry, and the military marches are also made in the same way as in
those corps.</p>

<p>The <i>special</i> and <i>theoretical</i> instruction consists
of:&mdash;</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>Primary instruction. Mathematics. Drawing. Geography. Military
history of France. Fortification and the various branches of the
engineering work.</p>
</div>

<p>Three civil professors (appointed by competition) are attached to
each regimental school, for the special theoretical instruction, as
regards the primary instruction, drawing, and mathematics.</p>

<p>The courses are distributed and taught in the following manner:</p>

<p>At the end of each course the colonel of the regiment causes a
general examination to be made in his presence of the whole of the men
who have followed this course, and has a list made out in the order of
merit, with notes of the capacity and aptitude of each.</p>

<p>These lists are consulted in the formation of tables of promotion,
and placed with the said tables before the inspector-general.</p>

<p>Each captain and lieutenant are obliged to give in at least a single
treatise on five different projects, consisting of a memoir discussing
or the journal of a siege, with drawing of the whole, and of details in
sufficient number to render them perfectly intelligible.</p>

<p>The <i>special practical</i> instruction is composed of seven
distinct schools, relating to:&mdash;</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>Field Fortification. Saps. Mines and Fireworks. Bridges. Ovens.
Topography. Gymnastics.</p>
</div>

<p>And they comprehend, in addition, sham sieges, and underground war.
Each of these seven schools is taught in accordance with the special
instructions annexed to the regulation, which, however, are not
published.</p>

<p>Winter is more especially devoted to the course of special
theoretical instruction, which commences on the 1st November, and
usually finishes on the 15th March, and the course of <i>special
practical</i> instruction is carried on during the summer from the 15th
March to the 15th September. The second fortnight of September and the
month of October are devoted to sham sieges and underground war, to the
leveling of the works executed, and to the arrangement of magazines.</p>

STAFF.</a></h4>

<p><span class = "firstword">It</span> will have been seen in the
accounts of the Polytechnic School and the School of Application at
Metz, in what manner young men destined for commissions in the artillery
and engineers receive their previous education, and under what
conditions appointments as officers in these two services are made in
France. The regulations for the infantry, the cavalry, and the marines
are of the same description. There are in these also the same two ways
of obtaining a commission. One, and in these services the more usual
one, is to rise from the ranks. The other is to pass successfully
through the school at St. Cyr. Young men who do not enter as privates
prove their fitness for the rank of officers by going through the course
of instruction given, and by passing the examinations conducted in this,
the principal, and putting aside the School of Application at Metz, the
one Special Military School of the country.</p>

<p>The earliest foundation of the kind in France was the Ecole Royale
Militaire of 1751. Like most other similar institutions of the time, it
was intended for the young nobility. No one was to be admitted who could
not prove four generations of <i>Noblesse</i>. The pupils were taught
free of charge, and might enter at eight years old. Already, however,
some marks of competition are to be discerned, as the best
mathematicians were to be taken for the Artillery and Engineers.
Buildings on the Plain of Grenelle (the same which still stand,
occupying one end of the present Champs de Mars, and retaining, though
only used as barracks, their ancient name,) were erected for the
purpose. The school continued in this form till 1776, when it was
dissolved (apparently owing to faults of discipline,) and replaced by
ten Colleges, at Sorrèze, Brienne, Vendôme, and other places, all
superintended by ecclesiastics. A&nbsp;new Ecole Royale Militaire,
occupying the same buildings as the former, was added in 1777.</p>

<p>This came to an end in 1787; and the ten colleges were suppressed
under the Republic. A&nbsp;sort of Camp School on the plain
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page226" id = "page226">226</a></span>
of Sablons took their place, when the war had broken out, and lasted
about a year under the name of the Ecole de Mars.</p>

<p>Under the Consulate in 1800, the Prytanée Français was founded,
consisting of four separate Colleges. The name was not long after
changed to the Prytanée Militaire; and after some time the number was
diminished, and La Flèche, which had in 1764 received the youngest
pupils of the old Royal Military School, became the seat of the sole
remaining establishment; which subsequently sunk to the proportions of a
mere junior preparatory school, and became, in fine, the present
establishment for military orphans, which still retains the title, and
is called the Prytanée Militaire de la Flèche.</p>

<p>A <i>special</i> Military School, in the meantime, had been set up at
Fontainebleau in 1803, transferred in 1808 to St. Cyr, and thus taking
the place of the Prytanée Militaire and of its predecessor, the original
Ecole Royale Militaire, gradually assumed its present form.<a class =
"tag" name = "tag1_15" id = "tag1_15" href = "#note1_15">15</a></p>

<p>The course of study lasts two years; the usual number of cadets in
time of peace is five, or at the utmost six hundred; the admission is by
competitive examination, open to all youths, French by birth or by
naturalization, who on the first of January preceding their candidature
were not less than sixteen and not more than twenty years old. To this
examination are also admitted soldiers in the ranks between twenty and
twenty-five years of age, who, at the date of its commencement, have
been actually in service in their regiments for two years.</p>

<p>The general conditions and formalities are the same as those already
stated for the Polytechnic. It may be repeated that all the candidates,
in accordance with a recent enactment, must have taken the usual degree
which terminates the task at the <i>lycées</i>&mdash;the baccalaureate
in sciences.</p>

<p>Those who succeed in the examination and are admitted, take an
engagement to serve seven years either in the cavalry or infantry, and
are thus under the obligation, if they are judged incompetent at the
close of their two years’ stay at the school to receive
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page227" id = "page227">227</a></span>
a commission, to enter and serve as common soldiers. The two years of
their stay at the school counts as a part of their service. It is only
in the special case of loss of time caused by illness, that permission
is given to remain a third year.</p>

<p>The ordinary payment is 60<i>l.</i> (1,500 francs) per annum. All
whose inability to pay this amount is satisfactorily established, may
claim, as at the Polytechnic, an allowance of the whole or of half of
the expenses from the State, to which may be added an allowance for the
whole or for a portion of the outfit (from 24<i>l.</i> to 28<i>l.</i>)
These <i>bourses</i> or <i>demi-bourses</i>, with the <i>trousseau</i>,
or <i>demi-trousseau</i>, have during the last few years been granted
unsparingly. One-third of the 800 young men at the school in February
1856 were <i>boursiers</i> or <i>demi-boursiers</i>. Candidates admitted
from the Orphan School of La Flèche, where the sons of officers wounded
or killed in service receive a gratuitous education, are maintained in
the same manner here.<a class = "tag" name = "tag1_16" id = "tag1_16"
href = "#note1_16">16</a></p>

<p>It was the rule till lately that cadets appointed, on leaving St.
Cyr, to the cavalry should be placed for two years at the Cavalry School
at Saumur. This, however, has recently been changed; on entering St. Cyr
those who desire appointments in the cavalry declare their wishes, and
are put at once through a course of training in horsemanship. Those who
are found unfit are quickly withdrawn; the remainder, if their place on
the final examination allows of their appointment to the cavalry, are by
that time sufficiently well practiced to be able to join their regiments
at once.</p>

<p>Twenty-seven, or sometimes a greater number, are annually at the
close of their second year of study placed in competition with
twenty-five candidates from the second lieutenants belonging to the
army,<a class = "tag" name = "tag1_17" id = "tag1_17" href =
"#note1_17">17</a> if so many are forthcoming, for admission to the
Staff School at Paris. This advantage is one object which serves as a
stimulus to exertion, the permission being given according to rank in
the classification by order of merit.</p>

<p>The school consists of two divisions, the upper and the lower,
corresponding to the two years of the course. Each division is divided
again into four companies. In each of these eight companies there are
sub-officers chosen from the <i>élèves</i> themselves, with
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page228" id = "page228">228</a></span>
the titles of <i>Sergent</i>, <i>Sergent Fourrier</i>, and
<i>Caporal</i>; those appointed to the companies of the junior division
are selected from the second year cadets, and their superiority in
standing appears to give these latter some considerable authority,
exercised occasionally well, occasionally ill. The whole school, thus
divided into eight companies, constitutes one battalion.</p>

<p>The establishment for conducting the school consists of&mdash;</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>A General as Commandant.</p>

<p>A Second in Command (a Colonel of Infantry.)</p>

<p>A Major, 4 Captains, 12 Lieutenants, and 5 Second Lieutenants of

Battalion.</p>

<p>A Major, 1 Captain, 34 Lieutenants, and 3 Second Lieutenants of
Cavalry to superintend the exercises, the riding, &amp;c.</p>

<p>One Assistant ditto.</p>

<p>One Professor of Topography and Mathematics.</p>

<p>One Professor of Military Administration, Military Art, and Military
History.</p>

<p>One Professor of Fortification.</p>

<p>One Professor of Military Literature.</p>

<p>Two Professors of History and Geography.</p>

<p>One Professor of Descriptive Geometry.</p>

<p>One Professor of Physics and Chemistry.</p>

<p>Three Professors of Drawing,</p>

<p>One Professor of German.</p>

<p>Eleven Military and six Civilian Assistant Teachers
(<i>Répétiteurs</i>.)</p>
</div>

<p>There is also a Quartermaster, a Treasurer, a Steward, a Secretary of
the Archives, who is also Librarian, an Almoner (a&nbsp;clergyman,) four
or five Surgeons, a Veterinary Surgeon, who gives lessons on the
subject, and twelve Fencing Masters.</p>

<p>The professors and teachers are almost entirely military men. Some
difficulty appears to be found by civilians in keeping sufficient order
in the large classes; and it has been found useful to have as
<i>répétiteurs</i> persons who could also be employed in maintaining
discipline in the house. Among the professors at present there are
several officers of the engineers and of the artillery, and of the staff
corps.</p>

<p>There is a board or council of instruction, composed of the
commandant, the second in command, one of the field officers of the
school staff, the director of studies, one of the assistant directors,
and four professors.</p>

<p>So, again, the commandant, the second in command, one of the field
officers, two captains, and two lieutenants, the last four changing
every year, compose the board or council of discipline.</p>

<p>St. Cyr is a little village about three miles beyond the town of
Versailles, and but a short distance from the boundary of the park. The
buildings occupied by the school are those formerly used by Madame de
Maintenon, and the school which she superintended.
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page229" id = "page229">229</a></span>
Her garden has given place for the parade and exercise grounds; the
chapel still remains in use; and her portrait is preserved in the
apartments of the commandant. The buildings form several courts or
quadrangles; the Court of Rivoli, occupied chiefly by the apartments and
bureaux of the officers of the establishment, and terminated by the
chapel; the Courts of Austerlitz, and Marengo, more particularly devoted
to the young soldiers themselves; and that of Wagram, which is
incomplete, and opens into the parade grounds. These, with the large
stables, the new riding school, the exercising ground for the cavalry,
and the polygon for artillery practice, extend to some little distance
beyond the limit of the old gardens into the open arable land which
descends northwards from the school, the small village of St. Cyr lying
adjacent to it on the south.</p>

<p><a name = "special_stcyr_buildings" id =
"special_stcyr_buildings">The ground floor</a> of the buildings forming
the Courts of Marengo, Austerlitz, and Wagram appeared to be occupied by
the two refectories, by the lecture-rooms or amphitheaters, each holding
two hundred pupils, and by the chambers in which the ordinary
questionings, similar to those already described in the account of the
Polytechnic School, under the name of <i>interrogations
particulières</i>, are conducted.</p>

<p>On the first floor are the <i>salles d’étude</i> and the <i>salle des
collections</i> the museum or repertory of plans, instruments, models
and machines, and the library; on the second floor the ordinary
dormitories; and on the third (the attics,) supplementary dormitories to
accommodate the extra number of pupils who have been admitted since the
commencement of the war.</p>

<p>The commission, when visiting the school, was conducted on leaving
the apartments of the commandant to the nearest of the two refectories.
It was after one o’clock, and the long room was in the full possession
of the whole first or junior division. A&nbsp;crowd of active and
spirited-looking young soldiers, four hundred at least in number, were
ranged at two long rows of small tables, each large enough, perhaps, for
twelve; while in the narrow passage extending up and down the room,
between the two rows, stood the officers on duty for the maintenance of
order. On passing back to the corridor, the stream of the second year
cadets was issuing from their opposite refectory. In the adjoining
buttery, the loaf was produced, one kilogramme in weight, which
constitutes the daily allowance. It is divided into four parts, eaten at
breakfast, dinner, the afternoon lunch or <i>gouter</i>, and the supper.
The daily cost of each pupil’s food is estimated at 1f. 80c.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page230" id = "page230">230</a></span>
<p>The lecture rooms and museums offer nothing for special remark. In
the library containing 12,000 books and a fine collection of maps, there
were a few of the young men, who are admitted during one hour every
day.</p>

<p>The <i>salles d’étude</i> on the first floor are, in contrast to
those at the Polytechnic, large rooms, containing, under the present
circumstances of the school, no less than two hundred young men. There
are, in all, four such rooms, furnished with rows of desks on each side
and overlooked in time of study by an officer posted in each to preserve
order, and, so far as possible, prevent any idleness.</p>

<p>From these another staircase conducts to the dormitories, containing
one hundred each, and named after the battles of the present
war&mdash;Alma, Inkerman, Balaclava, Bomarsund. They were much in the
style of those in ordinary barracks, occupied by rows of small iron
beds, each with a shelf over it, and a box at the side. The young men
make their own beds, clean their own boots, and sweep out the
dormitories themselves. Their clothing, some portions of which we here
had the opportunity of noticing, is that of the common soldier, the
cloth being merely a little finer.</p>

<p>Above these ordinary dormitories are the attics, now applied to the
use of the additional three hundred whom the school has latterly
received.</p>

<p>The young men, who had been seen hurrying with their muskets to the
parade ground, were now visible from the upper windows, assembled, and
commencing their exercises. And when, after passing downwards and
visiting the stables, which contain three hundred and sixty horses,
attended to by two hundred cavalry soldiers, we found ourselves on the
exercising ground, the cavalry cadets were at drill, part mounted, the
others going through the lance exercise on foot. In the riding-school a
squad of infantry cadets were receiving their weekly riding lesson. The
cavalry cadets ride three hours a-day; those of the infantry about one
hour a week. The exercising ground communicates with the parade ground;
here the greater number of the young men were at infantry drill, under
arms. A&nbsp;small squad was at field-gun drill in an adjoining square.
Beyond this and the exercising ground is the practice ground, where
musket and artillery practice is carried on during the summer. Returning
to the parade ground we found the cadets united into a battalion; they
formed line and went through the manual exercise, and afterwards marched
past; they did their exercise remarkably well. Some had been only three
months at the school. The
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page231" id = "page231">231</a></span>
marching past was satisfactory; it was in three ranks, in the usual
French manner.</p>

<p>Young men intended for the cavalry are instructed in infantry and
artillery movements and drill; just as those intended for the infantry
are taught riding, and receive instruction in cavalry, as well as
artillery drill and movements.</p>

<p>It is during the second year of their stay they receive most
instruction in the arms of the service to which they are not destined,
and this, it is said, is a most important part of their instruction. “It
is this,” said the General Commandant, “that made it practicable, for
example, in the Crimea, to find among the old <i>élèves</i> of St. Cyr,
officers fit for the artillery, the engineers, the staff; and for
general officers, of course, it is of the greatest advantage to have
known from actual study something of every branch.”</p>

<p>The ordinary school vacation last six or seven weeks in the year. The
young men are not allowed to quit the grounds except on Sundays. On that
day there is mass for the young men.</p>

<p><a name = "special_stcyr_routine" id = "special_stcyr_routine">The
routine of the day</a> varies considerably with the season. In winter it
is much as follows:&mdash;At 5 A.M. the drum beats, the young men quit
<ins class = "correction" title = "text has ‘theis’">their</ins> beds;
in twelve minutes they are all dressed and out, and the dormitories are
cleared. The <i>rappel</i> sounds on the <i>grand carré</i>; they form
in their companies, enter their <i>salles</i>, and prepare for the
lecture of the day until a quarter to 7.&nbsp;At 7 o’clock the officers
on duty for the week enter the dormitories, to which the pupils now
return, at a quarter to 8 the whole body passes muster in the
dormitories, in which they have apparently by this time made their beds
and restored cleanliness and order. Breakfast is taken at one time or
other during the interval between a quarter to 7 and 8 o’clock.</p>

<p>They march to their lecture rooms at 8, the lecture lasts till a
quarter past 9, when they are in like manner marched out, and are
allowed a quarter of an hour of amusement. They then enter the halls of
study, make up their notes on the lecture they have come from, and after
an hour and a half employed in this way, for another hour and a half are
set to drawing.</p>

<p>Dinner at 1 is followed by recreation till 2. Two hours from 2 to a
quarter past 4 are devoted to military services.</p>

<p>From 4 to 6 P.M. part are occupied in study of the drill-book
(<i>théorie</i>,) part in riding or fencing: a quarter of an hour’s
recreation follows, and from 6¼ to 8½ there are two hours of study in
the <i>salles</i>. At half-past 8 the day concludes with the supper.</p>

<p>The entrance examination is much less severe than that for the
Polytechnic; but a moderate amount of mathematical knowledge is
demanded, and is obtained. The candidates are numerous; and if it be
true that some young men of fortune shrink from a test, which, even in
the easiest times, exacts a knowledge of the elements of trigonometry,
and not unfrequently seek their commissions by entering the ranks, their
place is supplied by youths who have their fortunes to make, and who
have intelligence, industry, and opportunity enough to acquire in the
ordinary <i>lycées</i>, the needful amount of knowledge.</p>

<p>Under present circumstances it is, perhaps, more especially in the
preparatory studies that the intellectual training is given, and for the
examination of admission that theoretical attainments are demanded. The
state of the school in a time of war can not exactly be regarded as a
normal or usual one. The time of stay has been sometimes shortened from
two years to fifteen months; the excessive numbers render it difficult
to adjust the lectures and general instruction so as to meet the needs
of all; the lecture rooms and the studying rooms are all insufficient
for the emergency; and what is yet more than all, the stimulus for
exertion, which is given by the fear of being excluded upon the final
examination, and sent to serve in the ranks, is removed at a time when
almost every one may feel sure that a commission which must be filled up
will be vacant for him. Yet even in time of peace, if general report may
be trusted, it is more the drill, exercises, and discipline, than the
theory of military operations, that excite the interest and command the
attention of the young men. When they leave, they will take their places
as second lieutenants with the troops, and they naturally do not wish to
be put to shame by showing ignorance of the common things with which
common soldiers are familiar. Their chief incentive is the fear of being
found deficient when they join their regiments,
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page233" id = "page233">233</a></span>
and, with the exception of those who desire to enter the staff corps,
their great object is the practical knowledge of the ordinary matters of
military duty. “Physical exercises,” said the Director of Studies,
“predominate here as much as intellectual studies do at the
Polytechnic.”</p>

<p>But the competition for entrance sustains the general standard of
knowledge. Even when there is the greatest demand for admissible
candidates, the standard of admission has not, we are told, been much
reduced. No one comes in who does not know the first elements of
trigonometry. And the time allotted by the rules of the school to
lectures and indoor study is far from inconsiderable.</p>

SCHOOL.</a></h4>

<p>The examinations for admission are conducted almost precisely upon
the same system which is now used in those for the Polytechnic School.<a
class = "tag" name = "tag1_18" id = "tag1_18" href = "#note1_18">18</a>
There is a preliminary or pass examination (<i>du&nbsp;premier
degré</i>), and for those who pass this a second or class examination
(<i>du&nbsp;second degré</i>.) For the former there are three examiners,
two for mathematics, physics, and chemistry, and a third for history,
geography, and German. The second examination, which follows a few days
after, is conducted in like manner by three examiners. A jury of
admission decides. The examination is for the most part oral; and the
principal difference between it and the examination for the Polytechnic
is merely that the written papers are worked some considerable time
before the first oral examination (<i>du&nbsp;premier degré</i>,) and
are looked over with a view to assist the decision as to admissibility
to the second (<i>du&nbsp;second degré</i>.) Thus the <i>compositions
écrites</i> are completed on the 14th and 15th of June; the preliminary
examination commences at Paris on the 10th of July; the second
examination on the 13th.</p>

<p>The subjects of examination are the following:&mdash;</p>

<div class = "in-one hanging">
<p><i>Arithmetic</i>, including vulgar and decimal fractions, weights
and measures, square and cube root, ratios and proportions, interest and
discount, use of logarithmic tables and the sliding rule.</p>

<p><i>Algebra</i>, to quadratic equations with one unknown quantity,
maxima and minima, arithmetical and geometrical progressions, logarithms
and their application to questions of compound interest and
annuities.</p>

<p><i>Geometry</i>, plane and solid, including the measurement of areas,
surfaces, and volumes; sections of the cone, cylinder, and sphere.</p>

<p><i>Plane Trigonometry:</i> construction of trigonometrical tables and
the solution of triangles; application to problems required in
surveying.</p>

<p><i>Geometrical representations</i> of bodies by projections.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page234" id = "page234">234</a></span>
<p><i>French</i> compositions.</p>

<p><i>German</i> exercises.</p>

<p><i>Drawing</i>, including elementary geometrical drawing and
projections; plan, section, and elevation of a building; geographical
maps.</p>

<p><i>Physical Science</i> (purely descriptive:) cosmography; physics,
including elementary knowledge of the equilibrium of fluids; weight,
gravity, atmospheric pressure, heat, electricity, magnetism, acoustics,
optics, refraction, microscope, telescope.</p>

<p><i>Chemistry</i>, elementary principles of; on matter, cohesion,
affinity; simple and compound bodies, acids, bases, salts, oxygen,
combustion, azote, atmospheric air, hydrogen, water; respecting
equivalents and their use, carbon, carbonic acid, production and
decomposition of ammonia, sulphur, sulphuric acid, phosphorus, chlorine;
classification of non-metallic bodies into four families.</p>

<p><i>History:</i> History of France from the time of Charles VII. to
that of the Emperor Napoleon I. and the treaties of 1815.</p>

<p><i>Geography</i>, relating entirely to France and its colonies, both
physical and statistical.</p>

<p><i>German:</i> the candidates must be able to read fluently both the
written and printed German character, and to reply in German to simple
questions addressed to them in the same language.</p>
</div>

<p>The general system of instruction at St. Cyr is similar to that of
the Polytechnic; the lectures are given by the professors, notes are
taken and completed afterwards, and progress is tested in occasional
<i>interrogations</i> by the <i>répétiteurs</i>. One distinction is the
different size of the <i>salles d’étude</i> (containing two hundred
instead of eight or ten;) but, above all, is the great and predominant
attention paid to the practical part of military teaching and training.
It is evident at the first sight that this is essentially a military
school, and that especial importance is attached both by teachers and
pupils to the drill, exercise, and manœuvers of the various arms of the
service.</p>

<p>The course of study is completed in two years; that of the first year

<p>In addition to the above, there is a course of drawing between the
time when the students join the school early in November and the 15th of
August.</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>The course of <i>drawing</i> consists in progressive studies of
landscape drawing with the pencil and brush, having special application
to military subjects, to the shading of some simple body or dress, and
to enable the students to apply the knowledge which has been
communicated to them on the subject of shadows and perspective. This
course is followed by the second or junior division during the first
year’s residence.</p>

<p>The course of lectures in <i>descriptive geometry</i> commences with
certain preliminary
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page235" id = "page235">235</a></span>
notions on the subject; refers to the representation of lines on curved
surfaces, cylindrical and conical, surfaces of revolutions, regular
surfaces, intersection of surfaces, shadows, perspective, vanishing
points, &amp;c., construction of geographical maps, and <i>plan
côté</i>.</p>

<p>The lectures in <i>physical science</i> embrace nine lectures on the
general properties of bodies; heat, climate, electricity, magnetism,
galvanism, electro-magnetism, acoustics.</p>

<p>There are twelve lectures in <i>chemistry</i>; on water, atmospheric
air, combustibles, gas, principal salts, saltpetre, metallurgy, organic
chemistry.</p>

<p>There are fourteen lectures in <i>mechanics applied to machines</i>;
motion, rest, gravity, composition and resolution of forces, mechanical
labor, uniform motion, rectilinear and rotatory, projectiles in space,
mechanical powers, drawbridges, Archimedean principle, military bridges,
pumps, reservoirs, over and under-shot wheels, turbines, corn mills,
steam-engines, locomotives, transport of troops, materials, and
munitions on railways.</p>

<p>The twenty lectures in <i>military literature</i> refer to military
history and biography, memoirs of military historians, battles and
sieges, the art of war, military correspondence, proclamations,
bulletins, orders of the day, instructions, circulars, reports and
military considerations, special memoirs, reconnaissance and reports,
military and periodical collections, military justice.</p>

<p>The thirty-five lectures in <i>history</i> principally relate to
France and its wars, commencing with the Treaty of Westphalia and ending
with the Treaty of Vienna.</p>

<p>The twenty-seven lectures in <i>geography</i> and <i>military
statistics</i> are subdivided into different parts; the first eight
lectures are devoted to Europe and France, including the physical
geography and statistics of the same; the second six lectures are
devoted to the frontiers of France; and the third part of thirteen
lectures to foreign states and Algeria, including Germany, Italy, Spain,
Portugal, Poland, and Russia.</p>

<p>One lesson weekly is given in drawing, in order to render the
students expert in landscape and military drawing with the pencil, pen,
and brash.</p>

<p>We must not omit to call attention to the fact that mathematics are
not taught in either yearly course at St. Cyr.</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>The course in <i>topography</i>, of ten lectures, has reference to
the construction of maps, copies of drawings, theory, description, and
use of instruments for measuring angles and leveling, the execution for
a regular survey on the different systems of military drawing, drawing
from models of ground, on the construction of topographical drawing and
reconnaissance surveys, with accompanying memoirs.</p>

<p>Twenty-seven lectures are devoted to <i>fortification</i>; the first
thirteen relate principally to field fortification, statement of the
general principles, definitions, intrenchments, lines, redoubts,
armament, defilement, execution of works on the ground, means necessary
for the defense, application of field fortification to the defenses of
<i>têtes de pont</i> and inhabited places, attack and defense of
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page236" id = "page236">236</a></span>
intrenchments, &amp;c., castramentation; six lectures have reference to
permanent fortification, on ancient fortifications, Cormontaigne’s
system, exterior and detached works, considerations respecting the
accessories of defense to fortified places; eight lectures relate to the
attack and defense of places, preparations for attack and defense,
details of the construction of siege works from the opening of the
trenches to the taking of the place, exterior works, as auxiliaries,
sketches, and details of the different works in fortifications, plans,
and profile, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The students also execute certain works, such as the making of
fascines, gabions, saucissons, repair of revetments of batteries,
platform, setting the profiles, defilement, and construction of a
fieldwork, different kinds of sap, plan and establishment of a camp for
a battalion of infantry, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Under the head of <i>artillery</i>, fifteen lectures are given,
commencing with the resistance of fluids, movement of projectiles,
solution of problems with the balistic pendulum, deviation of
projectiles, pointing and firing guns; small arms, cannon, materials of
artillery, powder, munition, fireworks for military purposes; range of
cannon, artillery for the attack or defense of places or coasts, field
artillery, military bridges.</p>

<p>The students are practically taught artillery drill with field and
siege guns, practice with artillery, repair of siege batteries, bridges
of boats or rafts.</p>

<p>The ten lectures allowed for the course of <i>military
legislation</i> have for their object the explanation of the principles,
practice, and regulations relating to military law, and the connection
with the civil laws that affect military men.</p>

<p>The twelve lectures on what is called <i>military administration</i>
relate to the interior economy of a company, and to the various matters
appertaining to the soldier’s messing, mode of payment, necessaries,
equipment, lodging, &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>Military art and history</i> is divided into three parts. The
first, of five lectures, relates to the history of military institutions
and organization. The second, of fifteen lectures, refers to the
composition of armies and to considerations respecting the various arms,
infantry, cavalry, état-major, artillery and engineers, and the minor
operations of war. The third part, of seven lectures, gives the history
of some of the most celebrated campaigns in modern times. In the
practical exercises, the students make an attack or defense of a work or
of a system of fieldworks during their course of fortification, or of a
house, farm, village, in the immediate vicinity of the school, or make
the passage of a river.</p>

<p>The students receive twenty lectures in <i>German</i>, and are
required to keep up a knowledge of German writing.</p>

<h4><a name = "special_stcyr_exam" id = "special_stcyr_exam" href =
"#special_stcyr">EXAMINATIONS AT THE SCHOOL.</a></h4>

<p>The examinations at the end of the first year take place under the
superintendence of the director and assistant director of studies. They
are conducted by the professor of each branch of study, assisted by a
<i>répétiteur</i>, each of whom assigns a credit to the student under
examination, and the mean, expressed as a whole number, represents the
result of the student’s examination in that particular branch of study.
The examination in military instruction for training (in&nbsp;drill and
exercises) is carried on by the officers attached to companies, under
the superintendence of the commandant of the battalion, and that
relating to practical artillery by the officer in charge of that
duty.</p>

<p>The pupils’ position is determined, as at the Polytechnic, partly by
the marks gained at the examination, partly by those he has obtained
during his previous studies. In other words, the half of the credit
obtained by a student at this examination in each subject is added to
the half of the mean of all the credits assigned to him,
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page237" id = "page237">237</a></span>
in the same subject, for the manner in which he has replied to the
questions of the professor and <i>répétiteur</i> during the year; and
the sum of these two items represents his total credit at the end of the
year. The scale of credit is from 0 to 20, as at the Polytechnic.</p>

<p>Every year, before the examinations commence, the commandant and
second in command, in concert with the director and assistant director,
and in concurrence with the superior officer commanding the battalion
for military instruction, are formed into a board to determine the
amount of the minimum credit which should be exacted from the students
in every branch of study. This minimum is not usually allowed to fall
below eight for the scientific, and ten for the military
instruction.</p>

<p>Any student whose general mean credit is less than <i>eight</i> for
the scientific, or <i>ten</i> for the military instruction, or who has a
less credit than <i>four</i> for any particular study in the general
instruction, or of <i>six</i> for the military instruction, is retained
at the school to work during the vacation, and re-examined about eight
days before the re-commencement of the course, by a commission composed
of the director and assistant director of studies for the general
instruction, and of the second in command and the commandant of the
battalion, and of one captain for the military instruction.
A&nbsp;statement of this second examination is submitted to the minister
of war, and those students who pass it in a satisfactory manner are
permitted by him to proceed into the first division. Those who do not
pass it are reported to the minister of war as deserving of being
excluded from the school, unless there be any special grounds for
excusing them, such as sickness, in which case, when the fact is
properly established before the council of instruction, they are
permitted to repeat the year’s studies.</p>

<p>Irregularity of conduct is also made a ground for exclusion from the
school. In order to estimate the credit to be attached to the conduct of
a student, all the punishments to which he can be subjected are
converted into a specific number of days of punishment drill. Thus,</p>

<p>For each day confined in the police chamber, 4 days’ punishment
drill.</p>

<p>For each day confined in the prison, 8 days’ punishment drill.</p>

<p>The statement is made out under the presidency of the commandant of
the school, by the second in command, and the officer in command of the
battalion. The credits for conduct are expressed in whole numbers in
terms of the scale of 0 to 20, in which the 20 signifies that the
student has not been subjected to any punishment
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page238" id = "page238">238</a></span>
whatever, and the 0, that the student’s punishments have amounted to 200
or more days of punishment drill. The number 20 is diminished by
deducting 1 for every 10 days of punishment drill.</p>

<p>The classification in the order of merit depends upon the total
amount of the sum of the numerical marks or credits obtained by each
student in every branch of study or instruction. The numerical credit in
each subject is found by multiplying the credit awarded in each subject
by the co-efficient of influence belonging to it.</p>

<p><a name = "special_stcyr_merit" id = "special_stcyr_merit">To
facilitate this classification in order of merit</a>, three distinct
tables are prepared,&mdash;</p>

<div class = "inlist">
<p>The first relating to the general instruction;</p>
<p>The second relating to the military instruction; and</p>
<p>The third relating to the conduct;</p>
</div>

<p>and they respectively contain, one column in which the names of the
students are arranged by companies in the order in which they have been
examined; followed by as many columns as there are subjects of
examination, for the insertion of their individual credit and the
co-efficient of influence, by which each credit is multiplied; and
lastly by a column containing the sum of the various products belonging
to, and placed opposite each student’s name.</p>

<p>These tables are respectively completed by the aid of the existing
documents, the first for the general instruction, by the director of
studies; the second for the military instruction, by the officer
commanding the battalion; the third for conduct, under the direction of
the commandant of the school, assisted by the second in command.</p>

<p>A jury formed within the school, composed of the general commandant,
president, the second in command, the director of studies, and the
officer commanding the battalion, is charged with the classification of
the students in the order of merit.</p>

<p>To effect it, after having verified and established the accuracy of
the above tables, the numbers appertaining to each student in the three
tables are extracted and inserted in another table, containing the name
of each student, and, in three separate columns, the numbers obtained by
each in general instruction, military instruction, and conduct, and the
sum of these credits in another column.</p>

<p>By the aid of this last table, the jury cause another to be compiled,
in which the students are arranged in the order of merit as established
by the numerical amount of their credits, the highest in the list having
the greatest number.</p>

<p>If there should be any two or more having the same number of total
credits, the priority is determined by giving it to the student who has
obtained a superiority of credits in military instruction, conduct,
general instruction, notes for the year; and if these prove
insufficient, they are finally classed in the same order as they were
admitted into the school.</p>

<p>A list for passing from the second to the first division is forwarded
to the minister at war, with a report in which the results for the year
are compared with the results of the preceding year; and the minister at
war, with these reports before him, decides who
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page240" id = "page240">240</a></span>
are ineligible from incompetency, or by reason of their conduct, to pass
to the other division.</p>

<p>The period when the final examinations before leaving the school are
to commence, is fixed by the president of the jury, specially appointed
to carry on this final examination, in concert with the general
commandant of the school.</p>

<p>The president of the jury directs and superintends the whole of the
arrangements for conducting the examination; and during each kind of
examination, a member of the corps, upon the science of which the
student is being questioned, assists the examiner, and, as regards the
military instruction, each examiner is aided by a captain belonging to
the battalion.</p>

<p>The examination is carried on in precisely the same manner as that
already described for the end of the first year’s course of study. And
the final classification is ascertained by adding to the
<i>numerical</i> credits obtained by each student during his second
year’s course of study, in the manner already fully explained,
<i>one-tenth</i> of the numerical credits obtained at the examinations
at the end of the first year.</p>

<p>The same regulations as to the minimum credit which a student must
obtain in order to pass from one division to the other, at the end of
the first year, which are stated in page 160, are equally applicable to
his passing from the school to become a second lieutenant in the
army.</p>

<p>A list of the names of those students who are found qualified for the
rank of second lieutenant is sent to the minister at war, and a second
list is also sent, containing the names of those students that have,
when subjected to a second or revised examination, been pronounced by
the jury before whom they were re-examined as qualified.</p>

<p><a name = "special_stcyr_choice" id = "special_stcyr_choice">Those
whose names appear</a> in the first list are permitted to choose
according to their position in the order of merit, the staff corps or
infantry, according to the number required for the first named service,
and to name the regiments of infantry in which they desire to serve.</p>

<p>Those intended for the cavalry are placed at the disposal of the
officer commanding the regiment which they wish to enter.</p>

<p>Those whose names appear in the second list are not permitted to
choose their corps, but are placed by the minister at war in such corps
as may have vacancies in it, or where he may think proper.</p>

<p>The students who are selected to enter the staff corps, after
competing successfully with the second lieutenants of the army, proceed
as second lieutenants to the staff school at Paris. Those who fail pass
into the army as privates, according to the terms of the engagement made

<p><span class = "firstword">This</span> school was established in 1826,
and is considered<a class = "tag" name = "tag1_19" id = "tag1_19" href =
"#note1_19">19</a> the most perfect and extensive institution of the
kind in Europe,&mdash;perhaps the only one really deserving the title,
the others being more properly mere schools of equitation.</p>

<p>It is under the control of the Minister of War, and was established
for the purpose of perfecting the officers of the cavalry corps in all
the branches of knowledge necessary to their efficiency, and especially
in the principles of equitation,&mdash;and to diffuse through the corps
a uniform system of instruction, by training up a body of instructors
and classes of recruits intended for the cavalry service.</p>

<p>The instruction is entirely military, and is based upon the laws and
regulations in force with regard to the mounted troops. It includes;
1st. The regulations for interior service; 2nd. The cavalry tactics;
3rd. The regulations for garrison service; 4th. The regulations for
field service applied, as far as possible, on the ground, especially
with regard to reconnaissances; 5th. A&nbsp;military and didactic course
of equitation, comprising all the theoretical and practical knowledge
required for the proper and useful employment of the horse, his
breaking, application to the purposes of war, and various civil
exercises; 6th. A&nbsp;course of hippology, having for its object
practical instruction, by means of the model breeding-stud attached to
the school, in the principles which should serve as rules in crossing
breeds and in raising colts, to explain the phases of dentition, to
point out the conformation of the colt which indicates that he will
become a good and solid horse, the method to be pursued to bring the
colt under subjection without resistance, and, finally, to familiarize
the officers and pupils with all the knowledge indispensable to an
officer charged with the purchase and care of remount horses. This
course includes also a knowledge of horse-equipment, illustrated in the
saddle factory connected with the school; 7th. Vaulting, fencing, and
swimming. The non-commissioned officers are also instructed in the
theory of administration and accountability. The course
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page242" id = "page242">242</a></span>
of instruction continues one year, commencing in the month of October.
The pupils at the school are:&mdash;</p>

<p>1st. A division of lieutenants, (<i>lieutenants
instructeurs</i>.)</p>
<p>2nd. <span class = "dittomark">A division</span> of sub-lieutenants,
(<i>sous-lieutenants d’instruction</i>.)</p>
<p>3rd. <span class = "dittomark">A division</span> of sub-officers,
(<i>sous-officiers élèves instructeurs</i>.)</p>
<p>4th. <span class = "dittomark">A division</span> of non-commissioned
officers, (<i>brigadiers élèves</i>.)</p>
<p>5th. <span class = "dittomark">A division</span> of cavalry recruits,
(<i>cavaliers élèves</i>.)</p>

<p>The lieutenants are chosen out of the regiments of cavalry and
artillery, as well as from the squadrons of the park-trains and military
equipages, from the lieutenants who voluntarily present themselves for
the appointment to the General Board of Inspectors. Their age must not
exceed thirty-six years.</p>

<p>The sub-lieutenants are appointed from the cavalry regiments, must be
graduates of the Special Military School, not above thirty-four years of
age, and have served at least one year with the regiment.</p>

<p>The sub-officers are selected from the cavalry corps&mdash;one from
every two regiments of cavalry and artillery, and every two squadrons of
the park-trains and military equipages.</p>

<p>The non-commissioned officers are chosen annually by the
inspectors-general&mdash;one from each regiment of cavalry:&mdash;from
among those that show a peculiar aptness for equitation and are
distinguished by good conduct, information, zeal, and intelligence;
those who are recommended for promotion in their corps are selected in
preference. Their age must not exceed twenty-five years, and they must
have served at least one year in the ranks.</p>

<p>These pupils, numbering about four hundred, are sent to the school by
order of the Minister of War. They continue connected with their corps,
from which they are regarded as detached while they remain at the
school. They receive additional pay. Those who after due trial are found
deficient in the necessary qualifications, are sent back to their
regiments.</p>

<p>Upon the recommendation of the inspector-general of the school, the
officers who are serving as pupils, compete for promotion by choice with
the officers of the corps from which they are detached.</p>

<p>The cavalry lieutenant, who graduates first in his class, is
presented for the first vacancy as captain-instructor that occurs in the
cavalry, provided he has the seniority of rank required by law. The
lieutenant who graduates second obtains, under the same condition, the
second vacancy of captain-instructor, provided his division consisted of
more than thirty members. The sub-lieutenant graduating first, provided
he is not lower than the tenth in the general classification
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page243" id = "page243">243</a></span>
of the officers of both grades, is presented for promotion to the first
vacant lieutenancy that occurs in his regiment.</p>

<p>The non-commissioned officers who pass a satisfactory final
examination, are immediately promoted to vacancies that have been
preserved for them in their regiments&mdash;those who have graduated
among the first ten of the class, being presented for promotion as
sub-lieutenants, as soon as they have completed their required term of
service as non-commissioned officers. Those who attend the school as
non-commissioned officers, frequently return as officers for
instruction, and again in a higher grade on the staff of the school.</p>

<p>Officers transferred from the infantry to the cavalry are generally
sent to this school for a short time at least. The captains-instructor
of the cavalry regiments, and the instructors of equitation in the
artillery regiments, are mostly selected from the graduates.</p>

<p>The school also receives by voluntary enlistment, such young men, not
above the age of twenty-one years, as desire to enter the cavalry
service. They are not admitted until they have been subjected to an
examination before a committee, by whom they are classified according to
their fitness. These volunteer enlistments for the cavalry school are
made at Saumur, at least a month before the commencement of the course,
on presentation of the certificate of classification and of approval by
the commandant of the school. The number is limited to fifty each
year.</p>

<p>Such of these cavalry pupils as are distinguished for diligence and
good conduct and pass a satisfactory final examination are transferred
to the regiments of cavalry, for promotion to the rank of
noncommissioned officers by their respective colonels. Those who have
not been found fit for admission are sent back simply as privates.</p>

<p>A council of instruction is charged with the direction of the
studies. They propose useful changes, and direct the progress of the
studies. They are also charged with the examinations.</p>

<p><a name = "special_saumur_recit" id = "special_saumur_recit">The
recitations</a> are by sections of about thirty each. In reciting upon
the general principles of tactics, equitation, hippology, &amp;c., the
manner is as in our Military Academy; when reciting upon the movements
in tactics, all the commands and explanations of the instructor to the
troops are repeated “verbatim et literatim,” and in the tone and pitch
of voice used in the field. Perfect uniformity of tone and manner is
required. The object of thus reciting is to teach the pupils the proper
tone and pitch of voice, to accustom them to hear their own voices, and
to enable them to repeat the text literally at this pitch of voice,
without hesitation or mistake.</p>

OF THE FRENCH STAFF.</a></h4>

<p><span class = "firstword">The</span> staff is the center from which
issue and to which are addressed all orders and military
correspondence.</p>

<p>The officers of the staff are divided into chiefs of the staff,
sub-chiefs, staff-officers, and aides-de-camp.</p>

<p>The colonels and lieutenant-colonels are employed as chiefs of the
staff in the different military districts of France, and in the
divisions of the army on active service. The ordinary posts of the
majors and captains is that of aides-de-camp to general officers.</p>

<p>When several armies are united together under a commander-in-chief,
the chief of the general staff takes temporarily the title of
<i>Major-Général</i>, the general officers employed under him that of
<i>Aide-Major-Général</i>.</p>

<p>The duties of the chief of the staff are to transmit the orders of
the general; to execute those which he receives from him personally, for
field-works, pitching camps, reconnaissances, visits of posts, &amp;c.;
to correspond with the commanding officers of the artillery and the
engineers, and with the commissariat, in order to keep the general
exactly informed of the state of the different branches of the service;
to be constantly in communication with the different corps, so as to be
perfectly master of everything relating to them; to prepare for the
commander-in-chief and for the minister of war, returns of the strength
and position of the different corps and detachments, reports on marches
and operations, and, in short, every necessary information.</p>

<p>The distribution of the other officers of different ranks, when it
has not been made by the minister of war, is regulated by the chief of
the general staff.</p>

<p>In every division of the army an officer of the staff is specially
charged with the office work; the others assist him when necessary, but
they are more usually employed in general staff duties, in
reconnaissances, drawing plans of ground, missions, the arrangement of
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page246" id = "page246">246</a></span>
camps and cantonments, superintending the distribution of the rations,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>The officers of the staff may further be charged with the direction
of field-works thrown up to cover camps and cantonments.</p>

<p>Staff officers of all ranks may be employed on posts and detachments.
On special missions they command all other officers of the same rank
employed with them. When a staff officer is charged with the direction
of an expedition or a reconnaissance, without having the command of the
troops, the officer in command concerts with him in all the dispositions
it may be necessary to make to ensure the success of the operation.</p>

<p>The staff of generals of artillery and of engineers is composed of
officers of their respective arms.</p>

<p><a name = "special_staff_depot" id = "special_staff_depot">The war
depot</a> (<i>Dépôt de la Guerre</i>) was founded for the purpose of
collecting and preserving military historical papers, reconnaissances,
memoirs, and plans of battles; to preserve plans and MSS. maps useful
for military purposes, and to have them copied and published.</p>

<p>It is divided into two sections&mdash;one charged with
trigonometrical surveying, topography, plan drawing, and engraving; the
other with historical composition, military statistics, the care of the
library, the archives, plans, and maps. Each of these sections is under
the direction of a colonel of the staff corps, who has under his orders
several officers of his corps.</p>

<p>The war depot has taken a large share in the preparation of the map
of France. The first idea of undertaking this important work dates from
1808. After various delays and difficulties, the trigonometrical survey,
which had been for a time suspended, was recommenced in 1818. The work
was placed under the war depot, intrusted to the corps of geographical
engineers. Since this period the geographical engineers have been
incorporated in the staff corps, by the officers of which the work has
been continued. The primary triangulation was finished in 1845; the
secondary is now finished; the filling in the details will occupy
several years to come. The number of officers of the staff corps
employed on the survey has varied from twenty-six to ninety.</p>


<h5><a name = "special_staff_corps" id = "special_staff_corps" href =

number present, regimental officers may be temporarily employed, but
they return to their regiments as soon as officers of the staff corps
arrive to replace them. The division of the staff into
adjutant-general’s and quartermaster-general’s department does not exist
in the French service.</p>

<p>The only means of entering the staff corps is through the Staff
School of Application. Of the fifty student-officers which the School of
Application usually contains, twenty-five leave annually to enter the
staff corps, and are replaced by an equal number. Three of these come
from the Polytechnic, the remaining twenty-two are selected from thirty
pupils of the Military School of St. Cyr, who compete with thirty second
lieutenants of the army, if so many present themselves; but, in general,
the number of the latter does not exceed four or five.</p>

<p>The course of study in the Staff School of Application lasts two
years. The students have the rank of second lieutenant. On passing the
final examination they are promoted to the rank of lieutenant; they are
then sent to the infantry to do duty for <i>two years</i>, at the
expiration of which time they are attached for an equal period to the
cavalry. They may finally be sent for a year to the artillery or
engineers.</p>

<p>This routine can not be interrupted except in time of war, and even
then the lieutenant can not be employed on staff duty until he has
completed his <i>two years</i> with the infantry. However, officers who
have a special aptitude for the science of geodesy or topography, may
even earlier be employed on the map of France or other similar duty;
and, further, two of the lieutenants, immediately on quitting the Staff
School of Application, are sent to the war depot (<i>Dépôt de la
Guerre</i>) to gain a familiarity with trigonometrical operations.</p>

<p>The General Officers at their Inspections are required to report
specially to the Minister of War on the captains and lieutenants of the
staff corps doing duty with the regiments in their districts, both as to
their knowledge of drill and manœuvres, and their acquaintance with the
duties of the staff. They are to require these officers to execute a
military reconnaissance, never allowing more than forty-eight hours for
the field sketch and its accompanying report.</p>

<p>Officers of all arms of the rank of captain or under, are permitted
to exchange with officers of equal rank in the staff corps; but they
must previously satisfy the conditions of the final examinations of the
Staff College.</p>

<h4><a name = "special_staff_admit" id = "special_staff_admit" href =
"#special_staff">CONDITIONS OF ADMISSION.&mdash;ENTRANCE
EXAMINATIONS.</a></h4>

<p>The entrance to the Staff School of Application in France is, as is
the case in all the French military schools, by means of a competitive
examination, or, rather, by the results of three distinct examinations,
and by the selection of different sets of successful candidates.
<i>Three</i> are taken from the students leaving the Polytechnic, who
have an absolute right to the three first places in the Staff School,
and <i>twenty-two</i> are selected from the thirty best students leaving
St. Cyr, and an equal number of sub-lieutenants of the line under
twenty-five years of age, if so many present themselves. The
sub-lieutenants must have one year of service in that rank, and they
must make known their request to be allowed to compete for admission to
the Staff School to the Inspector General, and, through him, to the
Minister of War. It should be added, that their number is generally
extremely small.</p>

<p>The usual number of young officers admitted yearly to the school in
time of peace is twenty-five, but this number is sometimes considerably
exceeded, and we found no less than ninety present. The <i>three</i>
Polytechnic students select the Staff School after their final
examination, and the St. Cyr students make known their desire when the
whole are examined by a Board of Examiners, and the thirty best are then
selected as competitors for admission into the Staff School of
Application.</p>

<p>The sub-lieutenants also repair to St. Cyr, where they are examined
separately by the same examiners who have just conducted the examination
of the St. Cyr students, and in the same subjects.</p>

<p>Their marks or credits are then compared with those of the St. Cyr
pupils; and the relative position of the two sets of candidates is
ascertained, and the list of those to be admitted to the School of
Application determined accordingly.</p>

<p>These examinations take place before a Commission of Officers,
composed of,&mdash;</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>A Lieutenant-General President, appointed by the Minister of War.</p>

<p>The Director or Chief of the Dépôt de la Guerre.</p>

<p>The Commandant of the School of Application.</p>

<p>Four Colonels or Lieutenant-Colonels of the Staff, appointed by the
Minister of War.</p>

<p>A Field Officer chosen from among the Officers employed at the Dépôt
de la Guerre, as permanent Secretary.</p>
</div>

<p>This Commission is also charged with drawing up and proposing
regulations for the approval of the Minister of War concerning the
interior organization and the course of study to be followed in the
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page250" id = "page250">250</a></span>
school, and to make changes in the programmes for admission and for
leaving the school.</p>

<p>A very detailed account of the subjects of the <a name =

<p>The marks assigned and the influence allowed to each of these
subjects are the same as those given in the final examination at St.
Cyr. The entrance examination places the students in order of merit.</p>


<h5><a name = "special_staff_studies" id = "special_staff_studies" href
= "#special_staff">THE STUDIES.</a></h5>

<p>All the details of the teaching are in the hands of a Council of
Instruction, similar to that of the Polytechnic, and consisting of the
General Commandant (President,) the Director of Studies, and three
Military Professors, appointed yearly by rotation. Other professors and
assistant professors, or officers of the staff of the school, may be
called in to assist the Council, but (except in deciding the list at an
examination) they have no votes.</p>

<p>This council does not interfere directly with the administration, the
common work of the school. It draws up, indeed, the list of lectures,
making any alterations in them, or in the books to be used which may
seem from time to time desirable. But the officer accountable for the
daily working of the school is the Director of Studies. His functions
appeared to us to bring him into more constant connection with the
pupils than was the case with the director of the Polytechnique. In all
the schools the General Commandant and the Director of Studies live in
the establishment; but at the <i>Ecole d’Application</i> and at St. Cyr
the director “examines the methods of teaching, and proposes to the
Council of Instruction any modifications or improvements which may raise
or quicken the instruction. He inspects the work of the
student-officers, both in
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page251" id = "page251">251</a></span>
and out of the school. He keeps a register of the marks given by the
professors, and at the end of every three months brings the sum of them
before the General Commandant in a detailed report.” In fact, his school
functions are not modified, as at the Polytechnic, by a body of able
professors.</p>

<p>As already stated, there are fifteen professors, without reckoning
those of equitation, and thirteen of them are officers; but the system
of <i>Répétiteurs</i>, which we have seen so influential at the
Polytechnic, does not exist here.</p>

<p><a name = "special_staff_daily" id = "special_staff_daily">The hours
of work</a> are, in summer, <i>i.e.</i> from May to November, from six
to five, and in winter from eight to five, with the exception of one
hour for breakfast and one hour for <i>étude libre</i>, which appears to
mean very little indeed. From seven to nine hours daily may be taken as
the amount, but (as&nbsp;is the case with most French schools) there is
a constant change, not only in the subjects taught but in part of the
work being <i>out</i> and part <i>in</i> doors, some really head work,
much purely manual. There does not appear to be the same intense
application as at the Polytechnic; indeed, the work for three months in
the year is almost entirely in the open air, consisting in making plans
and military sketches, either in the neighborhood of Paris or in the
more distant parts of the country; eight months are devoted to the
in-door studies, one month to the examinations.</p>

<p>The in-door studies are entirely conducted in the halls of study
(<i>Salles d’étude</i>), in each of which we found parties of twelve or
fifteen students seated. They are inspected constantly by the director
or some of the professors. None of the regular work may be done in
private. It seems everywhere a fixed belief in the French Military
Schools that very much would be done idly and ill if done in private.
This presents a striking contrast to the feeling on the subject in
England.</p>

<p>The severer and preparatory studies of mathematics are supposed to
have been completed prior to entrance into the Polytechnic or St. Cyr.
Some, however, of the studies of applied science occupy considerable
time at the School of Application.</p>

<p>The following analysis will show the time assigned to each
branch:&mdash;</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>1. <i>Astronomy</i> occupies 1½ hours weekly for the pupils of the
first year; afterwards it ceases entirely.</p>

<p>2. To <i>Applied Descriptive Geometry</i> a good deal of time is
given, but still only by the pupils of the first year. 12 hours a week
are spent upon it in the first half year, 10 in the second.</p>

<p>3. <i>Military Topography</i> occupies about 10½ hours in the first
year, 6 in the second.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page252" id = "page252">252</a></span>
<p>4. A good deal of time is devoted to <i>Field Fortifications</i>. The
junior division, it is true, only begin it in their second half year of
study, and then only work at it for 1½ hours weekly. But the senior
division are occupied 4½ hours weekly in their first half year, and 7½
hours in their second.</p>

<p>5. <i>The Study of Military Administration and Legislation</i> is
begun immediately upon entrance. It occupies during both years 1½ hours
weekly.</p>

<p>6. <i>Lectures on Military Art and Tactics</i> are also given for 1½
hours weekly during both years, and after hearing these lectures the
students are occasionally required to write a military memoir on a
campaign, descriptions of reconnaissances, or of fields of battle, and
to make sketches of ground with accompanying reports. This course was
noted by General Foltz, the director of the school, as defective, on the
ground that it was too difficult to find a teacher for, or indeed to
teach military art; and he thought that lectures on military history, or
such works as Napoleon’s Memoirs, would be more useful to the
pupils.</p>

<p>7. <i>Drawing</i> occupies throughout 4½ hours weekly, and great
attention is bestowed upon it. “We were shown a large number of works
done by the young officers of the school. To enumerate some of the most
important&mdash;there were specimens of objects, with shadows;
perspective of the exterior and interior of buildings, with shadows;
perspective views of country; machinery drawings, plan, section, and
elevation; in fortification, a plan of comparison of a portion of ground
with proposed field-works for defense; military bridges; reconnaissance,
and memoir of a route, with accompanying notes and sketches, done both
on foot and on horseback; plan of a portion of country made with a
compass by parties of ten, under the direction of a Captain (for this
the trigonometrical points and distances were furnished, and it was
filled up by a minor triangulation;) plan of a field of battle, made
without points; and a description of the <ins class = "correction" title
= "close quote missing">battle.”</ins></p>
</div>

<p>These drawings were mostly executed with great care, and we were told
that the course was fully as much as the student could accomplish in two
years. Some parts of it are done entirely in the <i>Salle d’étude</i>;
sketches are made on horseback in the neighborhood of Paris, always
under the direction of the professors, others again at great distances,
such as one at Biarritz last year, and the one on which the pupils are
to be engaged this year, is the line of operations of Wellington from
the Spanish frontier to Toulouse. The two last kinds of work are roughly
sketched, and finished at Paris. These summer occupations seem to stand
in place of vacations, of which there are none.</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>(1.) To <i>Fencing</i>, three hours a week are given throughout.</p>

<p>(2.) To the <i>Cavalry Drill</i> two hours weekly in the first
division. It is replaced by <i>Infantry Drill</i> in the second.</p>
</div>

<p>The studies which none but the senior division pursue are,&mdash;</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>(1.) <i>Artillery</i> studies, which occupy 4½ hours weekly.</p>

<p>(2.) <i>Geography</i>, meaning chiefly the military geography of a
country, with a few lectures on statistics and political economy; these
take 1½ hours weekly.</p>

<p>(3.) <i>Geodesy</i>, or trigonometrical surveying, also for 1½
hours.</p>
</div>

<p>The only strictly literary occupation is the study of German for
about three hours per week during the whole time. We were told that a
large proportion of the pupils unite among themselves to learn English
privately, but no public course is given.</p>

<h5><a name = "special_staff_exam" id = "special_staff_exam" href =
"#special_staff">THE EXAMINATIONS.</a></h5>

<p>The students have two examinations to go through in each year; the
first commencing about the first of June, the last in November, and each
of the first year’s examinations is held before a jury consisting
of&mdash;</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>(1.) The General Commandant, or the Director of Studies;
President.</p>

<p>(2.) The Professor of the Course examined in.</p>

<p>(3.) Two Officers appointed by the Council of Instruction.</p>
</div>

<p>The last examination in each year is, of course, the most important,
inasmuch as the passage from the Second or Junior to the First or Senior
Division, and in part from the Senior into the Staff Corps, is regulated
by the results of these examinations; and the value allowed to the last
examination in each year is just double of that assigned for the
examinations in June.</p>

<p>The examinations of the first year are confined to the subjects of
study followed during that year, viz.:&mdash;</p>

<p>Descriptive Geometry, Astronomy, Topography, Artillery,
Fortification, Military Art and Administration, German, Drawing,
Register of Notes and Memoranda.</p>

twenty.</p>

<p>In the classification of the graphical representations in topography,
a mean of eight out of twenty, and in each of the other courses a mean
of six out of twenty; and as the general result of his various works and
of his examinations (the mean of the year being combined with the number
obtained before the jury in the proportion adopted by the Council of

<p>The School of Musketry, formed by the Ministerial Order of 29th
March, 1842, was only intended at first to supply instructors to the ten
battalions of Chasseurs who were armed with rifles. The results of its
establishment were, however, found so valuable, that the benefits of the
instruction it afforded were by degrees extended to the whole army.</p>

<p><a name = "special_musket_origin" id = "special_musket_origin">In
1845, the Duc d’Aumale</a>, who had taken a special interest in the
improvement of fire-arms and the better instruction of the soldier in
their use, was nominated Inspector-General of Schools of Musketry.
Besides the chief school at Vincennes, others were formed in the
principal garrisons; and eventually a regimental School of Musketry was
established in every regiment of infantry.</p>

<p>Some changes have been made in the system established under the Duke.
The School of Musketry at Vincennes has only been regularly organized on
its present footing since 1852. A&nbsp;portion of the fortress affords
the accommodation required for the theoretical instruction, while the
Polygon offers admirable facilities for practical instruction and target
practice.</p>

<p><a name = "special_musket_staff" id = "special_musket_staff">The

<div class = "in-one">
<p>A Commandant, a Lieut.-Colonel of Infantry.</p>

<p>A Professor, a Captain of Artillery.</p>
<p>An Assistant Professor, a Captain of Artillery.</p>
<p>A Sub-Instructor in Musketry, a Captain of Infantry.</p>
</div>

<p>Each regiment sends an Officer (a Sub-Lieutenant or a Lieutenant) to
Vincennes, to go through the course of instruction. The course commences
on the 1st of March, and lasts four months. Two hours a day three times
a week are devoted to lectures on the construction and use of fire-arms,
and the theory of projectiles. Each officer is required to complete a
certain number of drawings of the separate parts of arms. At the
termination of the course, certificates are given, and, if favorable, go
towards the officer’s claim to be promoted “<i>au choix</i>.”</p>

<p>We were conducted over the rooms of the fortress set apart for the
school by the officer charged with the Theoretical Instruction (Captain
Févre, of the Artillery.) They consist of a large paved
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page260" id = "page260">260</a></span>
room, where the officers perform their small-arm exercise in bad
weather; of the study-room, in which the drawings are executed; of a
lecture-room or amphitheater; of the library, chiefly supplied with
technical works on arms; and of a model-room, containing a very good
collection of French and foreign arms, and of portions of arms, to
illustrate the lectures. There are, besides, private rooms for the
instructors, and a room for the orderlies. On the ground floor a small
forge has been fitted up for the purpose of giving practical instruction
in some of the details of the manufacture of arms.</p>

<p><a name = "special_musket_course" id = "special_musket_course">To
produce accurate marksmen</a> is not the only object of the School of
Musketry. Its staff may be considered a description of standing
committee, to whom inventions in arms and ammunition are submitted, to
have their qualities practically tested. On the day of our visits
experiments on the relative merits of three forms of balls were being
carried on, which we witnessed.</p>

<p>Quitting the fortress by a bridge over the ditch, in an angle of
which the Duc d’Enghien was shot, we entered on the Polygon or practice
ground. In a few minutes two detachments of troops, one from the
Chasseurs de Vincennes, the other from the 20th regiment of the line,
arrived and took up their ground in front of the practice butts. Of the
balls between which comparisons were to be made, one was proposed by M.
Minié, who was himself present, another by M. Nessler, the third was
named the ball “<i>de la garde</i>.” There were six targets in line in
front of the butt; the Chasseurs fired at three of them, and the 20th
regiment at the other three. A trench runs along parallel to the butts,
and at a few yards in front of them. The line of targets is in the space
between the trench and the butts. The trench gives cover to the range
party, one of whom is stationed opposite to each target, in a rude
recess cut into the side of the trench, to afford shelter in wet
weather. Each time a target is struck, the man opposite to it raises his
banderol, which is then seen by the firing party, and acknowledged.</p>

<p>The trench is continued to some distance beyond the butts, and is
there met by another trench at right angles to it; so that one may go up
from the firing party to the range party without any risk.</p>

<p>On the cessation of the firing, the officer in command of the range
party numbered the hits in each target. He marked separately the hits
where the balls had arrived sideways (shown by the form of the
perforation,) a very important consideration in comparative experiments
with oblong balls.</p>

<p>Prizes and honorable mentions are bestowed annually on the best
shots. The number of the regiment and the names of the men thus
distinguished are inserted in the official military journal.</p>

<p><span class = "firstword">The</span> practice of gymnastics is an
essential part of the training both of officers and men in the French
army, and constitutes a portion of the regular exercise in every
military school. There are also several schools specially devoted to
this department of physical education, and one styled the Imperial
School of Military Gymnastics at the Redoute de la Faisanderie, part of
the fortifications near Vincennes, may be regarded as the Normal School
for training both officers and privates in order to act as monitors or
instructors in their respective regiments and battalions. The following
account of the instruction given, is abridged from an article in the
<i>New York Tribune</i>, under the heading, “How the French and the
English make their Soldiers.” The writer says that Military Gymnastics,
in the form and to the extent taught in this school, is exclusively
French, and is thought to have an important bearing on the more frequent
and deadly use of the bayonet in future warfare.</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>About three hundred privates and officers compose the School of
Military Gymnastics near Vincennes, where three professors of the
science and art of gymnastics give a course of practical instruction for
about six months each year. The school is under the same regulations as
the School of Musketry&mdash;each colonel being responsible for the
instruction of his regiment, and the lieutenant-colonel directs the
application of the rules and regulations.</p>


<h4><a name = "special_gymnastics_elementary" id =

ELEMENTARY GYMNASTICS.</a></h4>

<p>The gymnastic exercises are divided into “elementary gymnastics,” and
“gymnastics applied,” that is, applied to special military purposes.
A&nbsp;general progression regulates all the exercises.</p>

<p><a name = "special_gymnastics_class" id =
"special_gymnastics_class">The men are divided into three classes.</a>
The third class comprises all the recruits. These are exclusively
practiced in the first lessons of elementary gymnastics during the first
fortnight of their enlistment, and before they proceed to regimental
drill. The first class consists of those who are proficient in the first
four lessons of the general progression; and the second class, of those
who are preparing for the first. The first class practices twice a week;
the second, three times a week; the third class twice a day, until the
men have commenced their regimental drill, and then once a week. Each
practice lasts one hour and a half. “Returns” are drawn up recording the
zeal and progress of the men, as in musketry instruction; and the
captain instructor of gymnastics has to send in, every month, to the
lieutenant-colonel, similar returns as to
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page266" id = "page266">266</a></span>
the general progress of the instruction, so that the number of
effectives of each company may be accurately known.</p>

<p><a name = "special_gymnastics_spirit" id =
"special_gymnastics_spirit">None but the prescribed exercises</a> are
permitted by the instructor. He must never allow the men to attempt any
extraordinary or exaggerated feats, that might cause accidents. His aim
must be to develop the strength, agility and dexterity of the soldier by
a wisely regulated exertion, and inspire him with that self-reliance
which the various occasions of his military life may demand. He must
strive to rouse his pluck and emulation by rendering the exercises as
agreeable and as easy as possible, taking all necessary precautions to
prevent him from injuring himself or becoming discouraged. He must never
forget that the perfect safety of the soldier under training, the
pleasure of the various exercises, and, above all, the soldier’s own
desire to excel, are the first and secret elements of success in
gymnastics. Harsh treatment must be carefully avoided, much more
anything like turning his efforts into ridicule when he fails, or
punishing him for involuntary awkwardness. In conclusion, he must not
expect more than regularity, precision, and relative perfection in these
exercises, to which a military form has been given merely to facilitate
their study and their application to the whole army.</p>

<p>The men practice in their fatigue dress, in squads of ten or fifteen,
and are provided with belts.</p>

<p>The first exercises are intended to make the body supple from head to
foot, turning the head from right to left, forward and backward, or
merely toward right and left, bending the body, raising the arms
vertically, with and without bending them; flinging out the right or
left arm, fists clenched, and describing a circle of which the arm is
the radius.</p>

<p><a name = "special_gymnastics_march" id =
"special_gymnastics_march">No soldier marches so easily as the
French.</a> It is the result of his method of learning to march. In the
moderate and quick cadence the foot comes flat to the ground, the point
of the foot touching it first; in the running cadence the movement is an
alternate hopping on the points of the feet. It is obvious that this
mode of teaching to march must enable the soldier to avoid the great
cause of universal bad marching and walking, namely, bringing the heel
to the ground, thus shaking the whole body, especially the spine, and
consequently distressing the brain and lungs. By the great elevation of
the legs the soldier must habituate himself to bringing the toes first
to the ground, instinctively, to avoid the shock, especially in the
running cadence. During the practice the soldier repeats the words
“<i>one</i>&mdash;<i>two</i>,” as each foot comes to the ground, in
order to practice the lungs at the same time, and also to give a rhythm
to the performance.</p>

<p>In order still more to direct locomotion to the fore-part of the
foot, so essential to good and easy marching, there is the following
practice:&mdash;1.&nbsp;Attention. 2.&nbsp;Flexion of the lower limbs.
3.&nbsp;Commence. 4.&nbsp;Cease. At the second command the soldier
brings both feet together, throwing the weight of the body forward. At
the word <i>commence</i>, he slowly lowers his body by bending his hams,
so that the thighs touch the calves of the leg, the arms falling beside
the body, the weight of the body being entirely thrown on the points of
the feet. He then gradually rises to the erect position.</p>

<p><a name = "special_gymnastics_chain" id =
"special_gymnastics_chain">There is also what is called the “gymnastic
chain.”</a> Circles are traced on the ground contiguously; the men are
posted in these circles, in a single rank, three paces apart. The
instructor commands:&mdash;1.&nbsp;Squad will advance. 2.&nbsp;Double.
3.&nbsp;March. 4.&nbsp;Halt. At the first word the soldier throws the
whole weight of
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page267" id = "page267">267</a></span>
his body on the right leg. At the word <i>march</i>, he throws the left
foot smartly forward, the leg slightly bent, bringing the point of the
foot to the ground, thirty-nine inches from the right, and so in like
manner with the right, always keeping the weight of the body on the leg
which feels the ground, allowing the arms to take their natural motion
for equilibrium. The first man (a&nbsp;monitor, one of the best trained)
runs successively through all the windings of the chain of contiguous
circles without stopping; the others follow, preserving the distance.
When the men meet each other at the intersections of the circles, they
shorten or lengthen the pace, so as not to jostle each other, and so
that two men shall not pass by the same interval.</p>

<p><a name = "special_gymnastics_pyrrhic" id =
"special_gymnastics_pyrrhic">To deliver a thrust or a blow</a> with the
bayonet, sword, or fist to the best advantage, requires training of the
subsidiary muscles, and such scientific practice as places the body in
the best position to aid and intensify the effect. This is done by the
“Pyrrhic Exercise.” The command is:&mdash;1.&nbsp;Pyrrhic Exercise
(right or left limb forward.) 2.&nbsp;Ready. 3.&nbsp;March.
4.&nbsp;Halt. At the word <i>ready</i>, the soldier faces to the left,
carries the right foot forward, the heel sixteen inches from the hollow
of the left foot, the right knee bent, the left leg stretched, the right
arm extended forward, the fist clenched, on a line with the shoulder,
the nails slightly upward, the left arm in a line with the left side and
but little bent, fist clenched, and about six inches from the thigh, the
nails toward the thigh, the upper part of the body inclined forward, the
head erect, the eyes looking to the front, the left shoulder lowered. At
the word march, the soldier straitens his body, bringing the right heel
near the hollow of the left foot without touching the ground, turns at
the same time his right forearm, so that describing a circle from below
upward, the fist lightly touches the right breast, then flinging the
fist smartly forward, the nails a little upward, and advancing the right
leg to about twenty-five inches, the foot striking the ground with
force, or an “attack,” as we call it in sword exercise, the upper part
of the body inclining forward, the left leg stretched, the foot flat,
the left arm turned outward and along the thigh as before. These
movements are continued until the words “company&mdash;halt” are given,
when the soldier faces to the right and comes to attention. The left
arms are practiced in like manner, and a rhythm is given to the
performance by the repetition of the numbers 1, 2, 3, by the
soldier.</p>

<p>A soldier must not be easily knocked off his legs; so there are six
positions for the practice devised to teach the soldier how to maintain
his equilibrium. He stands alternately on the right or left leg, bending
the other against the body with his locked fingers, or he stands on one
leg, the other bent behind, or he comes slowly to the kneeling position
and springs up smartly, flinging his arms suddenly above his head, the
nails turned inward, and then comes to attention, or he bends forward on
one foot, or backward in like manner, and to the right or left, all on
one foot.</p>

<p>The elementary development of the muscles forms a most important part
of the training. By word of command the soldiers strike their breasts
with the right or left fist&mdash;strike out with the right and left as
in boxing&mdash;support cannon balls in the hand, one or both arms
extended, and hurl the balls to a distance. They fling an iron bar, held
by the middle; they support a heavy club in every possible position, at
the shoulder, behind the back, one with the left hand, another with the
right, at right-angles, or two together, one in each hand. They swing
the club horizontally and overhead, or vertically and behind, or round
and round the body.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page268" id = "page268">268</a></span>
<p>Preparatory to leaping, the proper muscles must be taught their
necessary contractions, and this is done to the words of
command&mdash;“Simultaneous flexion of the legs,” “Simultaneous flexion
of the thighs and legs,” whereat they hop on the right or the left leg
singly, and then on both together. They are practiced in advancing on
the position of kneeling on one leg alternately, obviously a very useful
mode of progression for a skirmisher in stealthily changing position
behind a low wall or a hedge.</p>

<p>They are taught to walk systematically on the heels alone and on
tiptoe, and to fling a cannon ball with the foot by means of a strap
attached to it. As practice alone can habituate us to the proper
inclination of the body in ascending and descending, both these modes of
marching are carefully taught, attention being fixed to throwing the
weight of the body on the point of the feet in the former, and on the
heels in the latter.</p>

<p><a name = "special_gymnastics_wrestling" id =
"special_gymnastics_wrestling">Their wrestling</a> takes every shape and
mode of contest. With extended arms, the fingers interlocked, the left
leg advanced, they push against each other; or, holding each other by
the hands or by the wrists, they pull against each other; or, each man
holding his left wrist with his right hand, the thumb underneath, seizes
with his left hand the wrist of his antagonist, and then at the word
“wrestle,” he pulls or pushes uniformly or by jerks, to the right, to
the left, forward, to the rear, upward and downward, striving to
displace his antagonist.</p>

<p>Furnished with appropriate handles, with a short cord attached, they
pull against each other, each striving to drag his antagonist with one
hand, then with both hands; and then three wrestle together in like
manner, the central man pulling or resisting the outer two, or both of
these pulling against him in opposite directions.</p>

<p>Then two wrestle in a sitting posture. They sit, closing the legs,
feet to feet, and sole to sole, with the aforesaid handle and cord
between their feet, and at the word of command pull away, striving to
raise each other. As soon as one is raised the contest ends, and the
victor holds the handle in his left hand. The instructor then makes all
those wrestle together successively who have won the handle, until only
two remain, and then ascertains the strength of these two by a
dynamometer, and makes a note of it.</p>

<p><a name = "special_gymnastics_traction" id =
"special_gymnastics_traction">The last of the elementary exercises are
those of traction</a>, or drawing against each other, holding on by a
rope, either in pairs, or several together pulling against a fixed
point, which may be a dynamometer, indicating the force of the combined
pull resulting, or the men are divided into two squads and pull against
each other.</p>

<p>As most of these exercises admit of a rhythm or cadenced sound
emitted by the men themselves, this vocal accompaniment is strongly
recommended. It certainly gives additional animation to the scene.
Indeed the cultivation of the voice is considered eminently essential in
the course of gymnastics. Singing exerts a salutary influence on the
chest, and, moreover, it is incontestable that it will be the means of
powerfully acting on the <i>morale</i> of the French soldier, by
teaching him songs of patriotic and martial import. The singing-lesson
at which I was present was particularly interesting. The system is one
recently invented, wherein the ordinary notes are represented by
arithmetical numbers&mdash;thus occupying about one-third of the usual
space. Pointing by means of two canes to each representative number is
all that is required by the instructor. The pupils, about 300 men and
officers, intoned the notes with admirable
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page269" id = "page269">269</a></span>
precision. When the instructor opened out the canes they made a
crescendo&mdash;swelling to the loudest&mdash;and when he closed them
gradually it was a beautiful diminuendo, “in linked sweetness long drawn
out.” There was then sung a concerted piece in two parts, extemporized
by the highly-gifted Commandant, who figured it on the blackboard. It
was at once most accurately sung&mdash;first and second so admirably
concerted that the whole seemed as it were an organ of human
stops&mdash;alto, tenor, and bass most harmoniously blending.</p>

<p>Such are the elementary gymnastics of the course.</p>


<h4><a name = "special_gymnastics_applied" id =
"special_gymnastics_applied" href = "#special_gymnastics">II. APPLIED
GYMNASTICS.</a></h4>

<p>The exercises of applied gymnastics must be directed with extreme
prudence. Care must be taken by the instructor that the emulation of the
pupils should not degenerate into a spirit of rivalry, instigating them
to dangerous efforts.</p>

<p><a name = "special_gymnastics_leap" id =
"special_gymnastics_leap">During cold weather</a> they must abstain from
executing leaps that require violent efforts; at all times those who are
not perfectly disposed should not be required to leap at all.
Carelessness and inattention to the rules can alone cause those
accidents apprehended in these exercises.</p>

<p>The dimensions of the obstacles to be leaped over must be gradually
increased; but no downward leap must ever exceed sixteen feet&mdash;five
meters. Such is the regulation; but really to leap down sixteen feet
seems no small matter, considering that the height of an ordinary
room&mdash;some ten or twelve feet&mdash;would make the nerves tingle if
we had to leap down that height; however, the French soldiers perform
such leaps with ease, and therefore we must conclude that all
Anglo-Saxons here or elsewhere can “go and do likewise.”</p>

<p>The words of command are: 1. Attention. 2.
Forward&mdash;leap&mdash;one, two, three. At the second word, the man
closes the points of the feet; at the word one, he stoops on his lower
extremities, slightly raising the heels and stretching his arms to the
rear, the fists clenched; he then rises again, the arms hanging
naturally down. At the word two, he repeats the movement; at three, he
recommences the same movement, stretches the hams vigorously, throwing
his arms forward, leaps the distance, or over the obstacle, falls on the
point of his feet, stooping down, and then comes to attention.</p>

<p>The same principle is observed in all leaping, whether to a height,
downward, or forward and downward&mdash;the only difference being in the
position of the arms. In leaping upward, the arms are flung overhead to
aid the ascent&mdash;the same in a downward leap; but if the leap be
forward and downward, the soldier begins with his arms in advance, and
then places them perpendicularly for the fall. The reverse takes place
when in leaping forward and upward.</p>

<p>Thus they practice leaping in every possible direction&mdash;upward
and downward combined&mdash;upward, forward, and downward&mdash;to the
right or to the left&mdash;to the right and to the left and downward
combined&mdash;the arms being directed accordingly. They leap backward
precisely in the <ins class = "correction"
title = "text has ‘some’">same</ins> directions, and according to the same rules. In
leaping backward from the top of a wall, the man first takes a glance at
the descent, turns, closes his feet&mdash;the heels projecting over the
wall, stoops&mdash;the upper part of the body being forward, places his
hands outside his feet and seizes the edge of the wall, the four fingers
above, the thumb underneath, and thus flings himself backward, his arms
overhead. When there is width as well as depth in the backward leap, the
body and the legs are flung off almost horizontally.</p>

<p>The running leap is performed in a similar manner&mdash;the run being
quickened
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page270" id = "page270">270</a></span>
more and more up to the moment of springing forward. Some of the leaps I
saw performed were from fifteen to twenty feet. As a complement to these
leaping exercises, the ground may be prepared with various objects to
leap over, such as benches, tables, heaps of stones, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The men are also progressively practiced in all these leaps, carrying
their arms and baggage. In such cases the downward leap must be
restricted to thirteen feet. The soldier holds his rifle balanced at the
trail with the right hand, the muzzle slightly raised, so as to prevent
it from touching the ground; he holds his sword (as&nbsp;the French
soldier has a sword) with his left hand. When the soldiers have become
familiar with leaping, the difficulty is increased by rendering movable
first the point of departure, and then the point of the fall, and,
finally, both these points are made movable. To leap from a body in
oscillation, the soldier leaps at the moment when the body is sinking.
There is great danger in leaping from an object in rapid motion. In case
of necessity, the soldier must face in the direction of the motion, and
at the moment of quitting it he must lay hold of it, shortening his
arms, and so push himself backward, lengthening his arms.</p>

<p>It is a general principle that in leaping from a height of any
extent, the soldier should avail himself of anything at hand to diminish
the shock of the fall.</p>

<p>The circumstances in which leaping must be resorted to are often
unforeseen, and require prompt decision; it is therefore important that
the men should be taught the following principles&mdash;useful to
everybody&mdash;to apply them spontaneously on all occasions:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>First.</i> To form a rapid judgment of the <ins class =
"correction" title = "text has ‘obstable’">obstacle</ins>, and also of
the ground on either side. We scan the ground in advance of the
obstacle, in order to make a good choice of a footing for the leap; if
the ground is too smooth the foot may slip; on soft ground there can not
be a good footing for the leap. By scanning the ground beyond the
obstacle, we select our landing-place, and we foresee what difficulties
we shall meet with. A&nbsp;difference of level between the point of
departure and the fall modifies considerably the extent of the leap.</p>

<p><i>Second.</i> During the leap the breathing must be restrained, and
the air with which the lungs have been previously filled must be expired
the moment the man reaches the ground.</p>

<p><i>Third.</i> In leaps in width and height, fling out the clenched
fists in the direction the body is to take, so as to augment the impulse
given by the legs.</p>

<p>To prove the utility of this principle, the men, in leaping,
sometimes hold in each hand a grenade of two-pounds weight, or a
four-pound shot; with this auxiliary the width of the leap is
augmented.</p>

<p><i>Fourth.</i> In downward leaps, raise the arms vertically as soon
as the body begins to descend, in order that the body, reaching the
ground on the point of the feet, may sink vertically without losing its
equilibrium. If a man leaps into water, he places his arms at his side,
his hands on his hips, the feet close together, the points of the feet
lowered, the body stiff and rigid.</p>

<p><i>Fifth.</i> During the whole time of the leap keep the arms in the
parallel position they have at its commencement, in order to preserve
the equilibrium of the body.</p>

<p><i>Sixth.</i> In forward or wide leaps incline the body forward, in
order that the oblique action of the legs on the body may be more
efficient.</p>

<p>The recommendation to precipitate the last movements of the run
preceding the leap, has the important advantage of enabling the soldier
to incline his body as much as possible.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page271" id = "page271">271</a></span>
<p><i>Seventh.</i> Fall on the point of the feet, the legs being close
together, bending all the articulations of the body from above downward,
in order that the shock be not transmitted to the head without being
lessened and attenuated by numerous decompositions of the force. The
articulations of the feet concur efficaciously with this result, and it
would be dangerous not to avail ourselves of them by falling on the
soles of the feet, especially the heels, as previously explained.</p>

<p><i>Eighth.</i> Avoid too rough a fall by giving to all the
articulations a general and supple “setting up,” so as to make a light
bound on landing.</p>

<p><i>Ninth.</i> On landing avoid all useless motion, allow the muscles
to relax; their continued contraction and rigidity would interfere with
the body’s equilibrium.</p>

<p>They also practice leaping with poles. These are of different
dimensions, beginning with the smallest&mdash;not longer than the
rifle&mdash;and finished with long ones from nine to twelve feet in
length. He then seizes the pole higher or lower, according to the
distance of the leap. Of course perfect success in this exercise depends
greatly upon the energy of the effort, and the long and rapid run by
which it is preceded. They also leap with two poles together from a
height, the poles being planted parallel and about two feet apart.</p>

<p>Suspension-bars are made subservient to the training of the French
soldier. This exercise enables him to use his body as he pleases, in any
possible position, provided he can get hold of anything. Its beautiful
and splendid result is extraordinary strength of arms, legs, hands, and
fingers. Indeed, these suspensions of the body by the hands, the elbow,
the legs, by one hand, one leg, one finger, in every possible position,
show how the men are prepared for the thousand casualties of the
assault.</p>

<p><a name = "special_gymnastics_climb" id =
"special_gymnastics_climb">They climb ropes</a> after the manner of
sailors, and horizontal beams are raised at various heights from the
ground, in which they learn to preserve a perfect
equilibrium&mdash;sitting, moving along them by the hands, supporting
the body, which is free to fall, and, finally, walking erect upon them
like a rope-dancer without his balance-pole! In these ticklish positions
they meet and pass each other&mdash;simulate a fall and recover; the
beams may be inclined or even set in motion, it matters not&mdash;they
hold on and do their work equally well&mdash;and drop to the ground
without injury.</p>

<p>They are taught to pick their way over scattered stones or stakes
driven into the ground; and it has even been thought expedient to teach
them how to walk systematically on stilts.</p>

<p><a name = "special_gymnastics_swim" id =
"special_gymnastics_swim">They are taught swimming</a>&mdash;all its
necessary movements before they go into the water; and many, I&nbsp;was
told, strike out at once, at the first trial, thus proving the
physiological or anatomical efficacy of the well-considered mode of
tuition. In the water they are practiced in performing the feats
required in actual warfare, carrying their arms and accoutrements in a
variety of ways, according to the supposed circumstances of the
campaign.</p>

<p>Of course, if the men are taught to swim they must be sent regularly
into the water. This regulation, therefore, insures personal
cleanliness&mdash;the first rule of health, which is much needed in all
armies. The morality of most armies is generally above the average; it
should naturally be less&mdash;as nothing conduces more to long life
than exercise, regular hours, and a rational <ins class = "correction"
title = "text has , for .">discipline.</ins> But cleanliness, personal
cleanliness is wanting, and we have to deplore the consequences.</p>

<p><a name = "special_gymnastics_escalade" id =
"special_gymnastics_escalade">With a view to escalading</a>, the French
soldier is assiduously trained in all the
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page272" id = "page272">272</a></span>
shifts of ladder-mounting&mdash;with ladders of wood and ladders of
rope&mdash;and he becomes as good as a sailor in pulling himself up a
rope, either looped, knotted, or smooth, from the ground to any
reasonable or unreasonable height. If a scaling-ladder be not at hand, a
tent-pole or any pole will do to enable him to get to the top of a wall
or the crest of a parapet. He is actually taught nine different modes of
performing this achievement so flattering to the ambition of the French
soldier.</p>

<p>The scaling of a represented turret was something beautiful to see.
“In the twinkling of an eye” or “done in no time,” can alone describe
the rapidity of the exploit.</p>

<p>Every appliance may, however, be wanting on certain occasions in
war&mdash;it matters not&mdash;the French soldiers are taught how to
mount a wall without any instrument whatever&mdash;with their feet and
the hands and the fingers alone. Bullets and cannon balls leave holes
and indentations in the hardest walls&mdash;these are represented on the
walls of the Gymnasium&mdash;and thus they practice this last resort of
the resolute and determined besiegers. If there be no holes&mdash;no
<i>points d’appui</i> for the ascent&mdash;what then? Why, then they
build a <i>pyramid of men</i>&mdash;four men stand as a base, two or
four more perch themselves on the shoulders of these, and then one
mounts to the top on the shoulders of the latter by way of apex!</p>

<p>They have adopted all the fetes of the <i>trapèze</i>, as performed
by acrobats. These tend to strengthen the arms and promote that
self-reliance and confidence which are the prime elements of a good
soldier. Some of their swinging leaps with the <i>trapèze</i> were
prodigious, from one end of the long gymnasium to the other, where they
alighted, and caught on the top of the wall, and descended to the
ground, with hands and fingers, by mimic bullet holes, as before
described.</p>

<p>Flying leaps on and over a wooden horse are practiced in every
possible direction, and the French cavalry are required to be able to
leap on their horses from the rear while galloping, and to leap over a
hedge or barrier together with the horses, but on foot, holding the
reins! It is impossible to believe that very many can do this; but that
is the aim, and the higher the aim the greater the effort, and something
worth having is sure to be done, even if we fail of the highest
attainment.</p>

<p><a name = "special_gymnastics_carry" id =
"special_gymnastics_carry">The most laborious</a> of the practices is
probably that of carrying, at the top of their speed, all the implements
of war, fascines, sand-bags, gabions, projectiles, &amp;c., whose weight
is progressively increased from twenty to fifty pounds. They must also
practice carrying ladders, beams, caissons, dragging gun-carriages,
&amp;c., and they are equally habituated to carry rapidly and skillfully
the wounded from the field of battle, by placing men on litters, or any
substitute at hand, in the gymnasium.</p>

<p>Sword exercise, bayonet exercise, boxing and fencing are also taught,
but only the rudiments. In the regiments and battalions they have more
opportunities of perfecting themselves in these accomplishments.</p>

<p>Such is a succinct account of the military gymnastics of the French.
The 300 various fetes and practices have only one object in view,
preparation for the possible and probable casualties of war, but they
have, meanwhile, the positive and immediate effect of giving the men the
utmost freedom of motion, <i>aplomb</i>, self-reliance, and that very
useful self-estimate in the soldier, namely, that he is superior to
every other in the world. It will take a vast deal to knock that conceit
out of him.</p>

<p><span class = "firstword">The</span> English Commissioners in their
Report on “The best Mode of Reorganizing the [English] System of
Training Officers for the Scientific Corps, together with an Account of
Foreign and other Military Education,” close with the following general
remarks on French Military Education:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class = "firstword">The</span> following summary may close our
account of French Military Education.</p>

<p><a name = "special_remarks_1" id = "special_remarks_1">1.</a> The
French army combines a considerable proportion of officers
professionally educated, with others, who form the majority, whose
claims to promotion consist in their service, proved ability, and
conduct. One-third of the officers in the line, two-thirds of those in
the scientific corps, and the whole of the staff, receive a careful
professional education; the remainder are taken upon the recommendation
of their superior officers, from the ranks. But it was stated to us
expressly that such officers do not often rise above the rank of
captain.</p>

<p><a name = "special_remarks_2" id = "special_remarks_2">2.</a> There
are no junior military schools in France, and no military education
commences earlier than sixteen. This is the very earliest age at which
pupils can be received at the Polytechnic or at St. Cyr, and the
<i>usual</i> age is later; whilst in the case of the Special Corps,
strictly professional education does not begin till twenty or
twenty-one. The best preparation for the military schools is found to be
that <i>general</i> (in&nbsp;France chiefly <i>mathematical</i>)
education which is supplied by the ordinary schools of the country,
directed as these are and stimulated by the open examinations for
admission to St. Cyr and the Polytechnic.</p>

<p><a name = "special_remarks_3" id = "special_remarks_3">3.</a> The
professional education for commissions in the line is that given at the
school of St. Cyr. A&nbsp;fair amount of mathematics is required at
entrance, but the chief instruction given at the school is of a
professional character. Active competition, however, which is the
principle of all French military education, is kept up amongst young men
educating for the line by the competitive entrance to the school, by the
system of examinations pursued in it, and in particular, by the
twenty-five or thirty places in the Staff School which are practically
reserved for the best pupils on leaving.</p>

<p><a name = "special_remarks_4" id = "special_remarks_4">4.</a> In the
Staff School itself the competitive system is acted upon; there are
strict examinations, and the pupils are ranged in the order of merit on
leaving the College.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page274" id = "page274">274</a></span>
<p><a name = "special_remarks_5" id = "special_remarks_5">5.</a> The
officers of artillery and engineers may be said to be in quite a
peculiar position in France, owing to the high education given at the
Polytechnic School. The consequence is, that the preparatory education
of French artillery and engineer officers is of the highest scientific
character. We have already spoken largely on this point, and need do no
more than allude to it.</p>

<p><a name = "special_remarks_6" id = "special_remarks_6">6.</a> We may
remark, that preparatory military education in France is mainly
mathematical&mdash;at the Polytechnic almost wholly so. The literary and
classical elements, which enter so largely into all education in England
and Prussia, are in French military education very much thrown aside.
Lectures in military history and literature are said, however, to
succeed at St. Cyr.</p>

<p><a name = "special_remarks_7" id = "special_remarks_7">7.</a> The
system of State foundations (<i>Bourses</i>) existing in the Polytechnic
and St. Cyr, and affording a curious parallel to the military
foundations in the Austrian schools, requires some notice. Every pupil,
in both the Polytechnic and St. Cyr, who can prove poverty, is entitled
to State support, either entire or partial. At the present time, not
less than one-third of the students in each of these schools receive
such maintenance. The system of civil <i>Bourses</i> is of old standing
in France; most of these were destroyed at the Revolution. They were
renewed and greatly devoted to military purposes by Napoleon. The extent
to which they are given may seem excessive, but it must prove a powerful
incentive and assistance to talent.</p>

<p><a name = "special_remarks_8" id = "special_remarks_8">8.</a> It has
been remarked that there is comparatively little practical teaching in
the School of Application for Artillery and Engineers at Metz. But a
very extensive practical training is in fact supplied to these officers
after they enter the service, remaining as they must do with the troops
until promoted to the rank of second captain, and subsequently being
employed in the arsenals, workshops, fortified places, &amp;c.</p>

<p><a name = "special_remarks_9" id = "special_remarks_9">9.</a> The
French have no “senior departments” for military education. In this
respect their practice differs from that of England and Germany.</p>

MILITARY EDUCATION IN 1869.</a></h3>

<p>The following remarks on French Military Education are from the
Report of the English Military Education Commission submitted to
Parliament, and printed in 1870:</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p><a name = "france_1869_1" id = "france_1869_1">1.</a> The proportion
of professionally educated officers in the line is greater now than in

one-third.</p>

<p><a name = "france_1869_2" id = "france_1869_2">2.</a> The
professional education for commissions in the line is given by a two
years’ course at St. Cyr, admission to the school being dependent on
competitive examination. Admission to the Artillery and Engineers is
obtained through the Polytechnic, where young men intended for
commissions in those arms receive a preparatory education of a highly
scientific character, in common with candidates for many other branches
of the public service. Admission to the school is obtained by
competition, and the choice of services is
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page275" id = "page275">275</a></span>
dependent on the results of another competitive examination at the end
of the two years’ course. Commissions are then obtained in the
respective corps, and the young officers go for a further period of two
years to the School of Application at Metz, there to receive their
strictly professional instruction. The course of teaching at Metz is
still mainly of a theoretical character, and the main portion of the
practical training of the officers is deferred until they join their
regiments. The Staff Corps is recruited entirely from the Staff School;
a very small number of pupils from the Polytechnic have a claim to
admission to the school, but the great majority of the students are
admitted by competitive examination, open nominally to the
sub-lieutenants of the army and to the best students of St. Cyr, but in
practice almost entirely confined to the latter. The students join the
school with commissions as officers; at the end of the two years’ course
they are definitely appointed to the Staff Corps in the order in which
they stand in a competitive examination, but before being employed upon
the staff they are sent to do duty for five years with the various
arms.</p>

<p><a name = "france_1869_3" id = "france_1869_3">3.</a> The military
schools in France are not, as in England and in Prussia, placed under
the control of a special department. They are all under the immediate
management of the Minister of War. There is, however, for each branch of
the service in the French army a consulting committee (<i>comité
consultatif</i>), or board of general officers, attached to the War
Department, for the purpose of giving advice to the Minister, and in
matters affecting the individual schools the Minister generally consults
the <i>comité consultatif</i> of that branch of the service for which
the school is specially preparatory.</p>

<p><a name = "france_1869_4" id = "france_1869_4">4.</a> Each school has
its own <i>conseil d’instruction</i>, composed of officers and
professors of the establishment, which exercises a general supervision
over the course of instruction, and has the power of suggesting
alterations or improvements in it. The financial business of the school
is managed by another board (<i>conseil d’administration</i>); and there
is generally also a similar board (<i>conseil de discipline</i>), which
exercises more or less authority in questions of discipline. The effect
of this arrangement is to give the various officers and professors of
each school to some extent a voice in the general management of the
institution.</p>

<p><a name = "france_1869_5" id = "france_1869_5">5.</a> The staff of
officers and instructors employed appears, in most cases, very large in
proportion to the number of the students; 48 for 270 in the Polytechnic;
33 for 170 in the school at Metz; 62 for 600 in St. Cyr, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Though there is in all the schools a military staff separate from the
staff of professors and instructors, and more especially charged with
the maintenance of discipline, the line of separation between the two
bodies is not, except at the Polytechnic, so distinctly drawn as in the
English military schools. The military professors exercise disciplinary
powers; while, on the other hand, the members of the strictly military
staff in almost all cases take some part in instruction. The latter
appear to be more utilized for this purpose than is the case either at
Sandhurst or Woolwich.</p>

<p><a name = "france_1869_6" id = "france_1869_6">6.</a> Considerable
care is exercised in the appointment of professors; at the Polytechnic
the candidates are selected by the <i>Conseil de Perfectionnement</i>;
at La Flèche they are recommended to the Minister of War by the Minister
of Public Instruction; at the Staff School and St. Cyr the appointments
are thrown open to competition.</p>

<p><a name = "france_1869_7" id = "france_1869_7">7.</a> The discipline
maintained at all the schools is of a very strict nature;
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page276" id = "page276">276</a></span>
except for the youngest pupils at La Flèche it is entirely military; the
punishments are similar to those inflicted in the army, and even include
imprisonment. The maintenance of discipline is considerably facilitated
by the fact that the pupils at most of the schools are actually subject
to military law; and those of St. Cyr, if dismissed from the school, are
sent into the ranks as private soldiers. There appears, however, in all
the schools to be an absence of the moral control over the young men
which is exercised in the Prussian schools. The Commandant of each
school has very extensive powers in regard to discipline, but in no case
has he authority to dismiss a student from the school without the
sanction of the Minister of War.</p>

<p><a name = "france_1869_8" id = "france_1869_8">8.</a> The principle
carried out in France is that special military education should not be
begun until a comparatively late age, and should be founded upon a
groundwork of good general education in civil schools. The only approach
to a junior military school in France is that of La Flèche, and this is
mainly a charitable institution; the pupils, it is true, learn drill,
but beyond this no special military instruction is given them. The
course of study is the same as that at the <i>Lycées</i> or ordinary
civil schools, and the pupils are under no obligation to enter the
military service. Nor can the Polytechnic be called an exclusively
military school; even those who enter the Artillery and Engineers from
it have their education in common with civilians at the very least until
the age of 18, and in the great majority of cases their strictly
professional instruction at Metz does not begin till 20 or 21.&nbsp;The
very earliest age at which a special military education commences in
France is 17, which is the age of admission to St. Cyr, and
comparatively few enter the school before 18 or 19.&nbsp;The knowledge
required for admission to St. Cyr is entirely such as is acquired at
civil schools, and so much importance is attached to a good general
education that the degree of either <i>bachelier ès sciences</i> or
<i>bachelier ès lettres</i> is made a necessary qualification for
admission to the examination, while the possession of both degrees gives
considerable advantage to a candidate. The principle of deferring the
commencement of special instruction has even received extension since
1856; the age of admission to St. Cyr, which was then 16, has been now
increased to 17, and the junior school of La Flèche has been made even
less military in its character than it was at that time.</p>

<p><a name = "france_1869_9" id = "france_1869_9">9.</a> When a
professional education has once commenced, the principle appears to be
that it should be almost entirely confined to subjects which have a
practical bearing on military duties. Mathematics, as a subject by
themselves, do not form part of the ordinary course of instruction at
any of the special schools. The previous course at the Polytechnic
secures of course very high mathematical attainments in the candidates
for the Artillery and Engineers who enter Metz; but at Metz itself the
study of mathematics is no longer continued. In the same way at the
Staff School a knowledge of mathematics as far as trigonometry is
required for admission, and their practical applications to operations
of surveying enter into the school course; but no part of the time spent
at the school is devoted to mere theoretical instruction in pure
mathematics; yet the officers of the Staff Corps are intrusted with the
execution of those scientific surveys which in our service are in the
hands of the Engineers.</p>

<p>St. Cyr offers to some extent an exception to the rule that the
course of study at the special schools should be of an exclusively
professional character, as the instruction given there during the first
year is partly of a general nature,
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page277" id = "page277">277</a></span>
embracing history and literature. This, however, arises from the fact
that the students from the <i>Lycées</i> generally show a deficiency in
the more literary subjects of a liberal education, and a portion of the
time at the school is therefore spent in completing and improving their
general acquirements. A&nbsp;knowledge of arithmetic, algebra, and plane
trigonometry is required as a qualification for admission, but beyond a
very <ins class = "correction" title = "text has ‘beief’">brief</ins>
revision of these subjects, and a voluntary course for <ins class =
"correction" title = "text has ‘condidates’">candidates</ins> for the
Staff Corps, mathematics are not taught at the school. It would seem
indeed that, except in the case of candidates for admission to the
Artillery and Engineers, mathematics do not hold so prominent a position
in French military education as is generally supposed in England to be
the case. For staff and regimental officers the main requisite demanded
seems to be a practical knowledge of trigonometry as required for
surveying.</p>

<p><a name = "france_1869_10" id = "france_1869_10">10.</a> Much time is
devoted in all the French schools to drawing in its various branches;
some hours daily are invariably given up to the subject; indeed the time
spent upon purely geometrical drawing appears almost to be excessive.
The great importance attached to the drawing of <i>machinery</i> is a
peculiar feature in all the schools. Landscape drawing is one of the
regular subjects taught to candidates both for the line and the Staff
Corps.</p>

<p>The theoretical instruction given at every school is supplemented by
visits to numerous military establishments, manufacturing departments,
and fortresses. This is also a feature in the system of military
education in Prussia; in both countries it seems to be thought desirable
to afford young officers a practical insight into the working of the
various establishments connected with the army. In the case of officers
of the Artillery and Engineers it appears in France to be made a special
object to cultivate a mechanical genius, and to secure a thorough
acquaintance with manufacturing departments with which their
professional duties bring them into contact.</p>

<p>Military law and administration (comprising financial and other
regulations connected with the army), and drill, riding, and fencing in
the way of practical exercises, form part of the education of officers
of all branches of the service; in drill, lectures explanatory of the
drill-book are invariably given in addition to the practical
instruction.</p>

<p><a name = "france_1869_11" id = "france_1869_11">11.</a> The system
of instruction in all the French military schools is more or less that
of the Polytechnic. Lectures attended by large numbers, enforced study
of fixed subjects, the execution of all work under close supervision of
the <ins class = "correction"
title = "text has ‘instrutors’">instructors</ins>, and frequent periodical examinations,
are everywhere found. Active competition is the leading feature of the
system; the students are perpetually being “kept up to the mark.”
A&nbsp;fixed period of two years is in all cases assigned to the course
of study; the course can not be completed in a shorter time, and the
regulated period can not (unless under quite exceptional circumstances)
be exceeded.</p>

<p>It seems also to be thought that, as a necessary consequence of the
strictly competitive system, the subjects upon which the competition
depends should be exactly the same for every student. No choice of
studies is allowed; those which enter into the examination are equally
obligatory for all. The only exception to this rule is at St. Cyr, where
in languages a choice between German and English is given.</p>

<p>No pecuniary rewards are offered to the students at any of the
schools. The bestowal of the numerous <i>bourses</i> which are granted
to those admitted to the
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page278" id = "page278">278</a></span>
Polytechnic and St. Cyr is regulated entirely by the poverty of the
candidates, without any regard to their ability.</p>

<p><a name = "france_1869_12" id = "france_1869_12">12.</a> The
education of officers in France is entirely concluded before any
regimental duty has been done. The French system is in this respect the
exact opposite of that pursued in Prussia, where no professional
instruction, as a rule, is given until a certain amount of service with
the troops has been performed. There are in France no establishments for
the instruction of officers of some years’ service, like the Staff
College in England, or the Artillery and Engineer School and the War
Academy in Prussia.</p>

<p><a name = "france_1869_13" id = "france_1869_13">13.</a> The chief
changes which have taken place in the military schools of France since
the publication of the Report of the Commissioners of 1856 may be
summarized as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>(<a name = "france_13_a" id = "france_13_a" href =
"#france_1869_13"><i>a.</i></a>) The modifications in the course of
instruction at the Polytechnic; the abridgement of the studies
previously pursued; and the slightly increased importance now attached
to literary subjects.</p>

<p>(<a name = "france_13_b" id = "france_13_b" href =
"#france_1869_13"><i>b.</i></a>) At Metz, the introduction of an
examination at the end of the first years’ course of study.</p>

<p>(<a name = "france_13_c" id = "france_13_c" href =
"#france_1869_13"><i>c.</i></a>) At St. Cyr, the alteration of the age
for admission to the school from 16 to 17; the extension of the subjects
of the entrance examination; the modifications in the course of
instruction, and the postponement of the commencement of strictly
military studies almost entirely until the second year; the introduction
of a stricter system of discipline, combined with additional
encouragements to good conduct and industry; and the increased
advantages offered with the view of attracting to the school a higher
class of professors and officers.</p>

<p>(<a name = "france_13_d" id = "france_13_d" href =
"#france_1869_13"><i>d.</i></a>) At La Flèche, the complete
reorganization of the institution with the object of more closely
assimilating its general arrangements to those of a purely civil
school.</p>

<p>(<a name = "france_13_e" id = "france_13_e" href =
"#france_1869_13"><i>e.</i></a>) At the Staff School some modifications
in the course of study and in the mode of admission to the school have
been made; but the most important alterations are those adopted in July
1869, by which the number of students admitted annually to the school is
increased considerably beyond the number of vacancies likely to occur in
the Staff Corps, and the novel principle is introduced that admission to
the school does not carry with it the certainty of permanent employment
on the staff.</p>
</div>

<p>It may be added that there seems a tendency to diminish the
importance of mathematics as an element of preparatory military
education, and to attach slightly more weight to studies of a literary
character. This is more particularly seen at St. Cyr and at La Flèche,
and to a less extent at the Polytechnic. There is also a growing
disposition to increase, in the case of the cavalry and infantry, the
proportion of officers who have received a professional education.</p>

“The complete solution of every question of calculation is necessarily
composed of two successive parts, which have essentially distinct
natures. In the first, the object is to <i>transform</i> the proposed
equations, so as to make apparent the manner in which the unknown
quantities are formed by the known ones; it is this which constitutes
the <i>Algebraic</i> question. In the second, our object is <i>to find
the value</i> of the formulas thus obtained; that is, to determine
directly the values of the numbers sought, which are already represented
by certain explicit functions of given numbers; this is the
<i>Arithmetical</i> question. Thus the stopping-point of the algebraic
part of the solution becomes the starting-point of the arithmetical
part.</p>

<p>In judging, however, of these numbers, it should be borne in mind
that, a very large number of the candidates who succeed have tried more
than once; the successful of this year have been among the unsuccessful
of last year, so that the proportion of individuals who succeed to
individuals who fail, is, of course, considerably larger than one to
four. Of the 170 candidates admitted in November, 1855, 117 had put down
their names for the examination of 1854, and 53 only had not been
previously inscribed. Of the 117 who put down their names, 19 had
withdrawn without being examined at all, 71 had been rejected on the
preliminary examination, 27 had been unsuccessful at that of the second
degree; 98 of the 170 came up for the second time to the
examination.</p>

The examination chamber is a small room in the school buildings, near
the library, ornamented with portraits of Vauban, and of D’Argenson,
under whose ministry the original schools at La Fère and Mézières were
founded. At a large table under these portraits, and extending across
the room, General Morin, President, and four officers, members of the
jury, were seated. The sixth member sat at a small table in front, near
the blackboard, at which the student stood. The Commandant, the Director
of Studies, and the other officers of the school were seated also in
this part of the room.</p>

<p>The student who was first examined was questioned partly by the
examiner, partly by the president, and gave his answers, working
problems and drawing illustrations on the board as he went on. He was
asked questions as to the details of the steam-engine, and as to the
method of casting cannon. The German teacher of the School put him on to
construe from a German book, and tried him in speaking; he succeeded
just passably in both. The whole occupied about three-quarters of an
hour.</p>

<p>The second student, after answering similar scientific questions, had
opportunity given him to show his knowledge, which was considerable, of
the geology of the neighborhood; and having lived in foreign countries,
he was able to make a very good display of his knowledge of German,
Spanish, Italian, and English.</p>

1803.</p>

<p>The four Schools of the Prytanée Français are converted into the
Prytanée Militaire, 1806; and are transferred to La Flèche, 1808.</p>

<p>The Ecole Spéciale Militaire is transferred to St. Cyr, also in
1808.</p>

<p><a name = "note1_16" id = "note1_16" href = "#tag1_16">16</a>
About twenty-five are sent every year from La Flèche. The admissions
from the army (<i>i.e.</i>, of soldiers between twenty and twenty-five
years old) do not amount to more than four or at the utmost five per
cent. They are very frequently young men who have previously failed for
St. Cyr, and who then enter the army as privates, and come in as such.
They have to pass the same examination.</p>

<p><a name = "note1_17" id = "note1_17" href = "#tag1_17">17</a>
Few usually present themselves; and these also, it is said, are very
generally old <i>élèves</i> of St. Cyr, who had not succeeded in
obtaining admission to the Staff School before. They are not examined
<i>with</i> the pupils of St. Cyr, but are intercalated in the list
according to their merit.</p>

<p><a name = "note1_18" id = "note1_18" href = "#tag1_18">18</a>
The system was, in fact, first tried at St. Cyr, and adopted, on the
representation of the Mixed Commission, at the Polytechnic. The previous
method, by which different sets of examiners took different districts,
had created distrust and dissatisfaction.</p>
