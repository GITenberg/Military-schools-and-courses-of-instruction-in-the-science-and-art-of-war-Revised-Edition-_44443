<p>According to the law of the 3rd of September, 1814, which is the
basis of the present military organization of Prussia, every Prussian
above twenty years of age, is bound to service in arms for the defense
of his country.</p>

<p>The military force of the country is made up of three distinct
bodies, and the whole of the adult male population is distributed among
them. It consists of,&mdash;</p>

<p>I. The Standing Army.</p>

<p>II. The National Militia or <i>Landwehr</i>, divided into two
portions, viz., the first <i>Landwehr</i> and the second
<i>Landwehr</i>.</p>

<p>III. The Last Reserve or <i>Landsturm</i>.</p>

<p><a name = "prussia_outline_standing" id =
"prussia_outline_standing">I.</a> The standing army is composed of all
young men between twenty and twenty-five years of age. The period of
service in time of war is for five years, but in time of peace the young
soldiers can obtain leave of absence after three years’
service;&mdash;they belong for the remaining two years to what is termed
the “reserve,” receiving neither pay nor clothing, and they are subject
to be recalled if war should break out.</p>

<p>Encouragement, indeed, is given and advantages held out to induce men
to stay, and to take a new engagement for an additional term of six
years; but it is said that only a small number are thus obtained. The
bulk of the troops are men serving for this short time; and there are
many, it should be added, whose term of service is even yet shorter. For
all educated young men, all, that is, who pass a certain examination,
are allowed, on condition that they pay for their own equipment and
receive no pay, to shorten their service from three years to one. This
privilege appears to be very largely used. It should also be stated,
that young men of any class may volunteer to perform their service at
any age after seventeen.</p>

<p>The Prussian standing army amounts at the present time to
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page282" id = "page282">282</a></span>
about 126,000 men. It is divided into nine army-corps or corps d’Armée,
one of which is named the guard, and the others are numbered from I. to
VIII. In each there is a regiment of artillery and a division of
engineers. A&nbsp;regiment of artillery consists, in time of peace, of
three divisions; each division of one troop of horse artillery and four
companies, of which, one is Fortress artillery with two-horsed pieces.
Each regiment has thus three companies for the service of the fortress
and twelve for field service. The whole of the artillery is under the
command of a general inspector, and it is divided into four inspections.
An engineer division is composed of two companies. There are nine
engineer divisions, one in each army corps. The whole are commanded by a
general inspector, and they are divided into three inspections.</p>

<p>The promotion in the Prussian infantry and cavalry is regimental, and
by seniority, up to the rank of major; after that it is by selection;
and an officer who has been passed over two or three times may consider
that he has received an intimation to retire from the service. In the
artillery the promotion is by regiments; in the engineers it is
general.</p>

<p><a name = "prussia_outline_landwehr" id =
"prussia_outline_landwehr">II.</a> The first Landwehr, or Landwehr of
the <i>first</i> summons (<i>des ersten aufgebots</i>,) consists
principally of young men between twenty-five and thirty-two years of
age, who enter when they have completed their period of service in the
standing army. They are called out once every year for service with the
divisions of the standing army to which they are attached, for a period
varying from a fortnight to a month; and they may be sent in time of war
on foreign service.</p>

<p>Those who have passed through the first Landwehr, enter at the age of
thirty-two in the second Landwehr, or Landwehr of the <i>second</i>
summons (<i>des zweiten aufgebots</i>.) They are called out only for a
very brief service once a year, and they can not at any time be ordered
out of the country, but continue to form a part of the <i>second</i>
Landwehr until they are thirty nine years of age.</p>

<p><a name = "prussia_outline_landsturm" id =
"prussia_outline_landsturm">III.</a> After the age of thirty-nine a
Prussian subject belongs to the last reserve or Landsturm, and can only
be summoned to service in arms upon a general raising, so to say, of the
whole population, when the country is actually invaded by the enemy.</p>

<p>With the standing army, the center of the system, all the other
forces are kept in close connection. For every regiment of the standing
army there is a corresponding regiment of Landwehr, and the two together
form one brigade. In the local distribution, every village and hamlet of
the Prussian dominions belongs to a certain
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page283" id = "page283">283</a></span>
regiment of Landwehr, serving with a certain regiment of the army, and
belonging accordingly to one of the nine army corps.</p>

<p>Such is the military organization, which, from the important part
played in it by the <i>Landwehr</i>, is sometimes termed the Prussian
<i>Landwehr</i> system. The history of its formation is remarkable, and
the circumstances which led to its creation helped also to create the
very peculiar education of the army.</p>

<p><a name = "prussia_outline_militia" id =
"prussia_outline_militia">The Prussian <i>Landwehr</i> or militia</a> is
not of modern origin; in its form at least it is but a revival of the
old feudal military organization, so far as that consisted of raising
the country <i>en masse</i>, instead of keeping up a permanent, trained,
and limited military force. <i>Landwehr</i> or <i>Landsturm</i><a class
= "tag" name = "tag2_2" id = "tag2_2" href = "#note2_2">2</a> was the
old German name for this feudal array, before the system of standing
armies was begun in Europe by Charles VII. of France, with his Scotch
regiments. It was possibly the failure of the trained Prussian
armies&mdash;long reputed the models of military discipline&mdash;in the
attack upon France in 1792, and still more signally at Auerstadt and
Jena, which partly led to the revival of the <i>Landwehr</i> as the
peculiar national force of Prussia. The means by which Stein, and after
his expulsion, Scharnhorst, called it into activity, was a master stroke
of policy under the existing difficulties of the country. The following
outline may be sufficient to explain its effects upon education.</p>

<p>The condition which Napoleon had exacted at Tilsit&mdash;a reduction
of the standing army from 200,000 to 40,000 men&mdash;would have lowered
Prussia at once to the rank of a second-rate power. It was adroitly
evaded by the plan of keeping only 40,000 men in arms at one and the
same time, disbanding these as soon as they were disciplined, and
replacing them constantly by fresh bodies. Thus the whole population of
the country was ready to rise in 1813, after the crisis of Napoleon’s
retreat from Russia. The plan was chiefly due to the genius of
Scharnhorst, whose early death deprived Prussia of her greatest
scientific soldier. The <i>Landwehr</i> then proved itself a most
efficient force, though its success was promoted by the national
enthusiasm, which must prevent our taking such a period as a criterion
of its permanent military working. Since that time it has continued to
be the national army of the country.</p>

<p>We were assured that this peculiarity of the Prussian army system, by
which almost every man in the country serves in his turn in the ranks,
has had a tendency to improve the education of the officers. It seems to
have been felt that the officers would not retain the respect of
intelligent privates unless they kept ahead of
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page284" id = "page284">284</a></span>
them in education. And this impression appears to have been the cause of
the royal edicts passed in 1816, by which it was required that every
Prussian officer should pass two examinations before receiving his
commission, one to test his general education, and the other his
professional knowledge.</p>


<h4><a name = "prussia_history" id = "prussia_history" href =
"#prussia">II. HISTORICAL VIEW OF PRUSSIAN MILITARY EDUCATION.</a><a
class = "tag" name = "tag2_3" id = "tag2_3" href = "#note2_3">3</a></h4>

<p><a name = "prussia_history_basis" id = "prussia_history_basis">The
Prussian system</a> of military education stands in close connection
with the general education of the country, just as the Prussian military
organization is the peculiar creation of that country’s history. And the
greatest improvements in the army and in its scientific teaching have
been made at those remarkable periods when we should most naturally have
looked for them&mdash;the time of Frederick the Great and the Liberation
war of 1813-1814.</p>

<p>The leading principles of Prussian military education consist,
<i>first</i>, in requiring from every officer in the army proof of a
fair <i>general</i> education before his entrance, and of a fair
<i>military</i> education afterwards. <i>Secondly</i>, they encourage a
higher military education in a senior school, which has almost
exclusively the privilege of supplying the staff.</p>

<p>In this requirement of a fair education, both general and military,
<i>universally</i> from its officers, Prussia stands alone among the
great military nations of Europe, and this honorable distinction is in a
great measure the result of the diffused system of education throughout
the country, and of the plan adopted by Stein and Scharnhorst, to make
the officers the leaders of the army both in education and in military
science.</p>

<p><a name = "prussia_history_origin" id = "prussia_history_origin">The
military schools</a> of Germany may be said to have begun with the
Reformation wars. Some such were founded by Maurice of Saxony, the great
political and military genius of Germany in that century; the example
was soon imitated in Baden, Silesia, and Brunswick, and a curious sketch
of military education, by the hand of Duke Albert of Brandenburg, has
been lately published from the Berlin archives, in which theology and
mathematics hold the two most important places.</p>

<p><a name = "prussia_history_1653" id = "prussia_history_1653">The
first school of any real importance</a> was founded in Colberg, by the
great elector, Frederick William, in 1653. This had considerable
success, and both his successors, King Frederick and Frederick William
I., improved it greatly, and finally transferred it to Berlin. It was
the time (about 1705, 1706,) of the great advance in military
engineering under Vauban and Coehorn, and a school
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page285" id = "page285">285</a></span>
for engineering was founded, in which some of their pupils had a great
share. The first Prussian trigonometrical survey also dates as early as
1702; that of England was not begun till 1784. It may indeed be said
that the scientific arms began to take a more favorable place in the
Prussian army about this time. They have held, and even still hold in
some respects, a less distinguished position in Germany than in France,
England, or Sardinia; and the first instance of an artilleryman being
made a general, was in the reign of Frederick William I.</p>

<p>On Frederick the Great’s accession he found several military schools
in existence. These had been chiefly founded by his eccentric father,
who had a passion for Cadet Houses and cadets, and their object is said
to have been to supply an education to the nobility, who at that time
were very ill-taught in Germany. After Frederick’s first wars, his own
attention was much occupied by the need of a better military education,
and he continued to work at the subject very zealously till his death.
His example on this point, as that of a great military authority, is
most instructive, since his object was at first only to educate cadets
<i>before</i> their entrance to the army, but was afterwards extended to
completing the education of officers already on active service. His
views on the last point were carried out by Scharnhorst. They were the
germ of the present Prussian military education.</p>

<p>It is curious to observe that the Austrian Succession War and the
Seven Years’ War, the first great wars since Louis XIV., and which broke
the Thirty Years’ Peace of the eighteenth century, are periods at which
scientific military education made a great step in Europe. A Treatise of
Marshal Count Beausobre’s on the subject first showed the existing want;
it is entitled “<i>Utilité d’une Ecole et d’une Académie Militaire, avec
des Notes, ou l’on traite des Ecoles Militaires de l’Antiquité</i>”. It
attracted great attention on its appearance. Most of the military
academies properly so called, date from about this time. The earliest
warrant for Woolwich, dates in 1741. The Theresianum of Maria Theresa
was begun at Vienna about 1748. The first French school was the
celebrated engineer school of Mezières founded in 1749. This was soon
followed by the old military school of Paris in 1751, and by the school
for artillery at La Fère in 1756. Frederick’s own <i>Ritter Academie</i>
dates from 1764.</p>

<p>Frederick began this institution with his usual energy, immediately
on the close of the Seven Years’ War. “My fire is quenched,” he writes,
“and I am now only busied in improving the practice of
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page286" id = "page286">286</a></span>
my men. * &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; * The position of the common soldier
may be left as it was before the war began, but the position of the
officers is a point to which I am devoting my utmost care. In order in
future to quicken their attention whilst on service, and to form their
judgment, I&nbsp;have ordered them to receive instruction in the art of
war, and they will be obliged to give reasons for all they do. Such a
plan, as you will see, my dear friend, will not answer with every one;
still out of the whole body we shall certainly form some men and
officers, who will not merely have their patent as generals to show,
(<i>die nicht blos patentirte Generale vorstellen</i>,) but some
capacity for the office as well.” He had, in fact, seen with great
admiration the improved military school recently founded by Maria
Theresa; and as it is best on such points to let this great authority be
heard for himself, we shall quote his own words:&mdash;</p>

<p>“In order to neglect nothing bearing on the state of the army, the
Empress founded near Vienna, (at&nbsp;Wiener Neustadt,) a college where
young nobles were instructed in the whole art of war. She drew to it
distinguished professors of geometry, fortification, geography, and
history, who formed there able pupils, and made it a complete nursery
for the army. By means of her care, the military service attained in
that country a degree of perfection which it had never reached under the
Emperors of the House of Austria; and a woman thus carried out designs
worthy of a great man.”</p>

<p>His letters show that he contemplated an improved school, and he says
to D’Alembert: “I&nbsp;send you the rules of my academy. As the plan is
new, I&nbsp;beg you to give me your honest opinion of it.” Accordingly,
the academy was founded. We will describe it in his own
words:&mdash;</p>

<p>“An academy was founded at the same time, in which were placed those
of the cadets who showed most genius. The king himself drew up the rules
for its form, and gave it a plan of instruction, which stated the
objects of the studies of the pupils, and of the education they were to
receive. Professors were chosen from the ablest men who could be found
in Europe, and fifteen young gentlemen were educated under the eyes of
five instructors. Their whole education tended to form their judgment.
The academy was successful, and supplied able pupils, who received
appointments in the army.”<a class = "tag" name = "tag2_4" id = "tag2_4"

<p><a name = "prussia_history_1765" id = "prussia_history_1765">This
school</a>, which was opened in 1765, was Frederick’s only foundation of
the kind; he was occupied with it incessantly. The plan of its studies
was drawn up by his own hand, and we have
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page287" id = "page287">287</a></span>
many of his letters of encouragement to its pupils or professors.
Whether he is writing to Voltaire, Condorcet, or “My Lord Marischal”
Keith, he constantly shows both his well-known attention to the economy
of his new school, and a paternal interest in his young cadets and their
teachers.<a class = "tag" name = "tag2_5" id = "tag2_5" href =
"#note2_5">5</a></p>

<p>Accordingly, both in professors and pupils, the new institution soon
gained an European character. Out of its <ins class = "correction" title
= "text has ‘twenty-first’">twenty first</ins> directors, no less than
ten were distinguished foreigners; one of the best teachers at Berlin
was D’Antoni, a distinguished soldier from the Turin institution and the
artillery school at Alessandria&mdash;schools which were still the
representatives of the military science of the great Italian generals,
of the Duke of Parma, of Spinola, and Montecuculi.</p>

<p>This institution was still, as it would appear, upon the old
principle of juvenile army schools, nor does Frederick seem to have set
on foot any school for officers after entering the service. But he
evidently felt strongly the need of improving his staff officers, and of
raising the science of his artillery and engineers. Thus we find him
referring to the French engineer school at Meziéres; and he endeavored
to raise the intelligence and education of his officers. It may,
however, be suspected that the spirit of the “Potsdamer Côterie,” as it
was called, became gradually, and particularly after Frederick’s death,
too literary and speculative to suit the rough work of war; and it may,
perhaps, be thought that some defect of this kind is still traceable in
the excessive amount of teaching and the abstract nature of some of the
subjects taught in the staff school at Berlin.</p>

<p>Such seems to have been the opinion of Scharnhorst, the virtual
author of the present system of army education, and whom the Prussians
still regard as their first authority on that subject. “Instruction is
given,” he says, “at the military school in all literature, in
philosophy, and in many various sciences. Frederick seems to have wished
to lay in it the foundation of the education at once of an officer and
of a learned man. Few men, however, are able to excel at once in various
branches of human knowledge, and the surest means to do so in <i>one</i>
is not to attempt it in <i>many</i>.”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page288" id = "page288">288</a></span>
<p>We have referred to Frederick and his school rather to show the
interest he felt in military education, than because his institution was
very important. Military education was still very imperfect, and it
completely languished in Prussia till Scharnhorst established it on its
present footing.</p>

<p>Scharnhorst was himself an Hanoverian, but entered the Prussian
service, and had seen by experience the defects of their system in the
campaigns of 1792, 1793, and 1805. He had long devoted especial
attention to military education and to all the scientific part of his
profession. Along with Blucher and Gneisenau, he was considered one of
the first generals of the army, and, on the exhaustion of Prussia after
Jena, he was selected to remodel its whole system. He did not live to
complete his work, having been killed early in 1812; but his statue near
the bridge at Berlin, remarkable for its noble and thoughtful
expression, records the gratitude of Prussia to its greatest scientific
soldier.</p>

<p>“The perfection of the French military organization,” says Mr.
Alison, <ins class = "correction"
title = "open quote missing">appeared</ins> to him in painful contrast beside the numerous
defects of that over which he presided. * &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; *
Boldly applying to the military department the admirable principles by
which Stein had secured the affections of the burgher classes, he threw
open to the whole of the citizens the higher grades of the army, from
which they had been hitherto excluded. * &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; * And
every department of the public service underwent his searching eye.”</p>

<p><a name = "prussia_history_1807" id = "prussia_history_1807">The work
began with the commission of 1807</a>, of which both Stein and
Scharnhorst were members. And the regulation of 1808 laid down the
principle broadly, that the only claim to an officer’s commission must
be, “in time of peace, knowledge and education; in war, courage and
conduct.”</p>

<p>On these principles, during the next three years, Scharnhorst laid
the foundations of the present education. He abolished most of the
existing juvenile schools, with the exception only of the Cadet Houses,
intended almost solely for the sons of officers. He changed the previous
war school into a sort of school <i>d’Elite</i>, consisting of a senior
and junior department, in which the younger soldiers of all arms were to
be imbued with such knowledge as might give them a scientific interest
in their profession, and in which senior officers (also of all arms)
were to have a higher course of a similar nature, success in which was
to form a recommendation for employment on the staff. He began the plan
of the division schools, where all candidates for commissions, but not
yet officers, might conduct their
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page289" id = "page289">289</a></span>
military studies along with the practice of their profession. Its idea
was to make some military study <i>necessary</i>, and successful study
<i>honorable</i>, in the army. Finally, he began the present system of
careful examination on entering the army.</p>

<p><a name = "prussia_history_changes" id =
"prussia_history_changes">The following historical notice</a> of the
origin and successive changes of the division schools is taken from a
communication by Col. Von Holleben, and a member of the General
Inspection of Military Instruction to the English Commission.</p>

<p>The cabinet order of the 6th of August, 1808, laid the foundation of
the present system of military education. It regulates the appointment
of Swordknot ensigns and the selection of officers, and declares that
the only title to an officer’s commission in time of peace shall be
professional knowledge and education, and in time of war distinguished
valor and ability.</p>

<p>The cabinet order of the 6th of August, 1808, could only come
gradually into operation; the system of military examinations had to be
created, and the educational institutions had to receive a new
organization, under the superintendence of a general officer. Four
provincial boards of examination were successively established, and on
the 1st December, 1809, a body of instructions, still very vague and
general, was issued for their guidance.</p>

<p>A cabinet order of the 3rd of May, 1810, remodeled the military
schools, directing, in addition to the cadet schools at Berlin and
Stolpe, the formation of three military schools for Swordknot ensigns,
(<i>Portepée-Fähnriche</i>,) one at Berlin for the marches (<i>Die
Marken</i>,) and Pomerania, a second at Königsberg, for east and west
Prussia, and a third at Breslau, for Silesia; and the formation of a
military school at Berlin for officers. All these institutions were
placed under the general superintendence of Lieutenant-General Von
Diericke, who had also the special superintendence of the boards of
examination. A&nbsp;board of military studies was created and intrusted,
under his control, with the task of carrying the regulations into
effect.</p>

<p>Before, however, the new institutions attained to any stability the
war years of 1813-14-15 intervened, and the operations of the board of
examinations ceased.</p>

<p>Soon after the conclusion of peace directions were given that the
examinations should recommence, with an equitable consideration of the
claims of the Landwehr officers, ensigns, and other young persons who
had grown up during the war.</p>

<p>At first there was only one board of examination at Berlin, with
large discretionary powers as to their mode of procedure. In April,
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page290" id = "page290">290</a></span>
1816, a cabinet order was issued to form boards of examination for the
Swordknot at every brigade, as the present divisions were then called,
besides the existing board at Berlin, for the examination for an
officer’s commission.</p>

<p>Contemporaneously with the nine boards of examination, the board of
military studies, by an order of January, 1816, directed the
establishment of schools for every brigade, and attempted to gradually
regulate the instruction they gave. The schools contained two classes,
the lower to prepare candidates for the Swordknot, the higher to prepare
candidates for the rank of officer. As, however, no standard of
attainment was required for admission into the schools, their
instruction had to commence with the first elements, and was charged
with more work than it could perform. The weaker scholars stayed two,
three, or more years in the lower class, and the education of the better
scholars was impeded.</p>

<p>During this and the following period the authority over the
examination boards (the <i>Præsidium</i>,) was distinct from that over
the schools, (the general inspection,) and it was not till later that
both authorities were vested in a single person. This division of
powers, intended to secure the independence and impartiality of the
examinations, led to the result that the two authorities were
occasionally led, from a difference of principles, to labor in different
directions. Still, in the infancy of military education, the rivalry it
occasioned, was favorable to a rapidity of development.</p>

<p>An order of the 16th of March, 1827, added French to the studies for
the ensigns’ examination, and fixed a higher standard of attainments in
military sciences for the officers’ examination.</p>

<p>Nearly at the same time, a cabinet order of the 27th of March, 1827,
directed that there should be only one class for Swordknot ensigns in
the division schools, and that after October, 1829, the candidate should
obtain a testimonial of fitness for the rank of Swordknot ensign
previous to admission as a student.</p>

<p>Accordingly young men had to be prepared for examination for the
Swordknot at their entrance into their corps, or might prepare
themselves by private studies and instruction during their service.</p>

<p>The task of the schools, still very comprehensive embracing all the
liberal sciences as well as the military, was accomplished during this
period in two courses of nine months, in a higher and a lower class.</p>

<p>A cabinet order of the 31st of January, 1837, introduced the entrance
examination, instead of the examination for the <ins class =
"correction" title = "text has . for ,">Swordknot,</ins>
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page291" id = "page291">291</a></span>
being declared that every candidate for the commission of an officer,
after his reception into a corps, should prove in an examination his
possession of the knowledge requisite for a Swordknot ensigncy before
his actual appointment. At the same time a regulation of the ministry of
war, of the 17th of December 1836, remodeled and more precisely defined
both the entrance (Swordknot ensign) examination, and that for the
commission of an officer. This regulation, while it essentially modified
the instruction given at the division schools, furnished them at the
same time with a more certain clue for their guidance. The preparation
of youths for the Swordknot examination during their service in the
corps was discontinued. But the standard of the entrance examination was
still too low, requiring only a small portion of the branches of a
general liberal education, and that not in the shape in which they are
taught in our gymnasia. Hence the evil result, that young men, previous
to their entrance into a corps, had usually to prepare for the military
profession at private institutions instead of at the gymnasia, and
nevertheless brought with them a very defective amount of preparatory
training; on the other hand, the demands of the officers’ examination
were very multifarious. It still required the general scholastic
sciences by way of formal education, and the military sciences as a
special education for the military profession. Thus the task of the
division schools continued overwhelming, and an aim was set before them
which they could not attain.</p>

<p>A regulation of the 4th of February, 1844, reformed simultaneously
the whole system of military examination and education.</p>

<p>The views which guided these reforms, the improvements and advantages
which were hoped to be thereby obtained, were, in general, the
following:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The military profession, like every other, requires a general
school education intended generally to cultivate the mind, distinct from
the subsequent special and professional education for which the former
is the necessary groundwork.</p>

<p>The former is tested in the examination for the Swordknot, the latter
in the officers’ examination.</p>

<p>2. The preparatory education required from the candidate for a
Swordknot is the function of the ordinary schools of the country.
Nothing but what they can impart is required, and from consideration of
the youthful age of the candidates (seventeen years,) the amount of
preparatory training required is not the attainment of the highest class
of the gymnasium, but only that required for admission into the
Prima.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page292" id = "page292">292</a></span>
<p>3. The required previous training not only gives the candidate a more
certain basis for his subsequent military education, but, as being the
groundwork of all professions, leaves him afterwards at liberty to
cultivate the special knowledge requisite for any profession that he may
prefer.</p>

<p>4. The division schools are freed from a multifarious course of
instruction in the scholastic sciences, a task beyond their power: the
result of which was that the majority of scholars were very little
advanced in formal and general education, and but superficially grounded
in the elements of the professional sciences, while they spent years in
being drilled for an examination, instead of being educated for
life.</p>

<p>5. If the division schools have an able staff of military teachers,
they can give a good professional education. The younger officers, even
if they never received the full training of the gymnasium, may still, by
their professional training, raise themselves above their subordinates,
(a&nbsp;class in Prussia often highly educated,) and are started with an
excellent preparation for their professional career.</p>

<p>6. By the amount of liberal education required in the examination for
the Swordknot, the friends of those destined for the military profession
are admonished to provide them an education equal to that received by
the members of other professions.</p>

<p>7. By the method pursued in the examinations the power is retained of
raising or lowering the standard according to circumstances. When the
supply of officers is deficient, the standard can be lowered; at other
times, as at present, it may be raised. Since the above-mentioned
regulations, the following essential alterations have been
introduced:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The examination for the Swordknot is again placed after admission
into the corps, but no one can be admitted to attend the division
schools without a testimonial of fitness for the rank of Swordknot
ensign.</p>

<p>2. A testimonial of fitness for the university, <i>i.e.</i>, to have
passed the abiturient examination, dispenses with the examination for
the Swordknot. In consequence of this rule fifty abiturients on an
average annually enter the army. These, as well as the selectaner of the
cadet corps, must be considered, in point of scientific education, an
excellent supply of officers. From the powerful impulse that military
instruction has received in the last fifty years, it may be expected
that the time is not distant when the candidate for an officer’s
commission, instead of passing the Swordknot examination,
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page293" id = "page293">293</a></span>
will have to bring the finished training of the gymnasium; in other
words, to have passed the abiturient examination.</p>

<p>3. Instead of the seventeen division schools there are now by the
regulation of 1844, only nine, and a further reduction of their number
to four or three is contemplated, with an improvement of the staff of
teachers and a stricter supervision of the scholars.</p>


<h4><a name = "prussia_system" id = "prussia_system" href =
"#prussia">III. SYSTEM OF MILITARY EDUCATION AND PROMOTION.</a></h4>

<p>The standing army composed in the manner and under the circumstances
already described, is supplied with officers who must have a good
general education, and have served in the ranks, or have obtained a
certain amount of professional instruction. The usual course is as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><a name = "prussia_system_commission" id =
"prussia_system_commission">Young men obtain a nomination</a> from the
colonel of a regiment. This nomination admits them merely to service in
the regiment as privates, with a recognition of their being candidates,
<i>aspiranten</i> or aspirants, for the rank of officer. Before they
obtain that rank, the following conditions must be fulfilled. They must
pass an examination in the common subjects of a good general education,
such as the sons of well-born or wealthy civilians may be supposed to
receive. They must serve six or nine months with the troops; they must
attend nine months at a division school, or twelve months in the
artillery and engineer school, where they receive a course of special
military instruction; and they must pass an examination in professional
subjects before a board sitting at Berlin. They are then eligible for a
vacancy. In order to obtain a commission they require further the
recommendation of the officers of the regiment.</p>

<p>It is obvious to remark, that in obtaining a commission in the
Prussian service the candidate’s chance depends greatly on the
recommendation of the colonel and the after assent of the officers. The
effect of this is to maintain an exclusive character in the army. Above
two-thirds of the commissions are obtained by the course described
above; the remainder are granted to those who pass through the cadet
schools.</p>

<p>Of these there are five altogether, four junior establishments,
situated in certain provincial towns, and one senior or upper school at
Berlin, to which the others are merely preparatory. They are all
supported by the state; mainly for the purpose of educating the children
of meritorious officers in want of assistance; but they are also open to
others. With the exception of the highest class of the upper school, the
<i>Selecta</i> above mentioned, the instruction given is of a perfectly
general character, and there is no obligation even for
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page294" id = "page294">294</a></span>
those who have received the most ample pecuniary assistance to enter the
military profession. The discipline, however, is military, the teachers
are mostly officers, the pupils are regularly drilled, and most of them
actually go into the army. This they do in ordinary cases without going
through the highest or select class in which professional instruction is
given; they merely pass the same preliminary examination as the
candidates nominated by the colonels of regiments; they enter the army
without their commissions, and have to obtain them in the same manner as
the other candidates, by serving six or nine months with the troops, and
by following their professional studies in the division or artillery and
engineer schools, and by passing the officers’ or second examination
before the examining board at Berlin. Those who do remain to go through
the highest or select class receive their professional instruction in it
instead of in the division or artillery and engineer schools, and they
are examined for their commissions by the board while still at the cadet
school.</p>

<p>Thus, in the course usually followed, three requisites are exacted in
Prussia before a commission is given; first, a good general education;
secondly, some actual military service; and, thirdly, professional
knowledge gained by something like a year of military study. But the
military service is not required from the upper thirty students of the
<i>Selecta</i> of the Cadet House.</p>

<p>It will be well to mention, at the commencement, the names of the two
examinations. The first, the preliminary examination, merely testing the
general education, admits to a particular grade among non-commissioned
officers; those holding it rank between sergeants and corporals, and in
consideration of their being candidates (<i>aspiranten</i>) for a
commission wear a different sword-knot, and hence have the name of
Swordknot ensign or <i>Portepée-fähnrich</i>. The first or preliminary
examination is accordingly called the <i>Portepée-fähnrich</i>
examination. The second, the professional one, is the officers’
examination, for the commission of second <ins class = "correction"
title = "text has ‘lieutentant’">lieutenant</ins>.</p>

<p><a name = "prussia_system_boards" id = "prussia_system_boards">These
two examinations</a>, for the grade of <i>Portepée-fähnrich</i> and for
the officer’s commission, are either conducted or controlled by the
Supreme Military examinations Board,
(<i>Ober-Militair-Examinations-Commission</i>) in Berlin, a body partly
composed of military officers, partly of eminent civilians.</p>

<p>The various examining boards, the central and the local ones, which
conduct these two examinations, are quite independent of the military
schools, and were formerly presided over by a different
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page295" id = "page295">295</a></span>
head; but in order that the system should be uniformly carried out, and
as Colonel von Holleben expresses it, that “<i>the examinations should
exercise a salutary influence on education, and that their standard
should be adjusted to the capacities of the schools</i>,” they have now
been placed under the same control as the military schools.</p>

<p><a name = "prussia_system_supreme" id = "prussia_system_supreme">The
whole department</a> of military education is therefore now under the
control of a single high functionary, bearing the title of the general
inspector of the military schools, military education, and military
studies (<i>das Militair Erziehungs-und-Bildungswesen</i>,) who reports
direct to the king on all subjects relating to examination and
instruction. He submits his proposals on matters of administration to
the minister of war, who issues the necessary orders to the boards
charged with the financial control of the various schools.</p>

<p>The general inspector is assisted by a supreme council or board of
military studies, composed of field officers of the general staff and of
the special arms, the directors of the war school, of the supreme board
of military examinations, of the artillery and engineers school, the
commander of the cadet corps, some of the consultative assessors
(<i>Vortragenden Räthen</i>,) of the minister of worship, and of
individuals selected from the general body of learned men
(professors.)</p>

<p><a name = "prussia_system_class" id = "prussia_system_class">The
principal military schools</a> of Prussia may be divided into five
classes:&mdash;</p>

<p>I. Those which give a good general education to the sons of

too poor to provide for them. Such are,&mdash;</p>

<p>9. The Military Orphan Houses (<i>Militair-Waisenhäuser</i>,) at
Annaburg, Potsdam, and Pretzsch.</p>

<p>10. The schools for soldiers’ children.</p>

particularly the Frederick-William’s Institution at Berlin, and the
Knight Academy (<i>Ritter-Academie</i>,) or Noble School, in
Liegnitz.</p>

EXAMINATIONS&mdash;GENERAL AND PROFESSIONAL&mdash;FOR A

<p>Two examinations, one in general and the other in professional
knowledge are required of all candidates for a commission upon or soon
after their entrance into the army, unless they can bring a certificate
of having successfully completed the regular course of a gymnasium, in
which case they are excused from the first.</p>

<p>These two examinations, through which alone admission is obtained to
the rank of officer, are so important, and hold so prominent a position
in the Prussian military system, that we propose to preface our account

"prussia_exams_prelim" href = "#prussia_exams">1. <i>The Preliminary or
Ensign’s (Portepée-fähnrich) Examination.</i></a></h5>

<p>According to a special law, any young man above seventeen and a half
and under twenty-three years of age, whether he be a private or a
corporal, if he has served six months in the army, and can obtain from
the officers of his company a certificate of good conduct, attention,
and knowledge of his profession, may claim to be
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page298" id = "page298">298</a></span>
examined for the grade of ensign or (<i>Portepée-fähnrich</i>.) If he
succeed in this examination, he is recognized as a candidate, an
<i>aspirant</i> for a commission; but his prospect of obtaining a
commission is subject to a variety of subsequent conditions.</p>

<p>In practice, a young man who aspires to a commission applies to the
colonel of the regiment and usually obtains a nomination before he
actually joins; and, as the examination is entirely of a civil
character, he is usually glad to try and pass it at once. Having
recently come from school, he feels probably better prepared than he is
likely to be at any subsequent time: for on joining the corps, he will
have for some time to conform to the life of a private soldier, to sleep
and mess with the men, and to mount guard in his turn; and with the
drill and exercises, and the marching and manoeuvring with the troops,
he will have enough to occupy him to prevent his preparing for the
examination. The two qualifications for the ensign’s grade are, the test
of the examination and the six months’ service; but it appears to be
indifferent in what order they are taken, whether service comes first
and examination after, or <i>vice versâ</i>.</p>

<p>The examinations take place quarterly, at the beginning of every
January, April, July, and October. They are held in the great garrison
towns by local military boards, consisting of a president and five
examiners. Applications for permission to be examined must be made at
least a fortnight before, and must be accompanied by certificates
stating the candidate’s birth, parentage, &amp;c.; certificates of
diligence and good conduct from the schoolmasters or other teachers who
have instructed him; and of bodily fitness from an army surgeon.</p>

<p>The local board of examiners is appointed by the general officer in
command of the army corps, the centers of examination corresponding in
present practice with the localities assigned to the division or
army-corps schools, nine in number, presently to be described.</p>

<p>The first part of the examination is on paper; a <i>vivâ voce</i>
examination follows.</p>

<p>On paper the young men have to write three themes or compositions in
German, to translate two passages, one from Livy or Sallust, another
from Cæsar’s Commentaries, Cicero’s Epistles, or Quintus Curtius; to
translate sixteen or twenty lines from French into German, and two
passages, a longer and a shorter, from German into French. They have one
question in common arithmetic, one in equations, progressions, or
logarithms; one in geometry, one in
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page299" id = "page299">299</a></span>
trigonometry; they have one in mathematical or physical geography, one
in the general geography of Europe and its colonies, and one in that of
Germany and Prussia. There is one question in Greek or Roman history;
one in the earlier German history; one in modern; and one in Prussian
history. They have also to show that they are acquainted with the common
conventional signs used in representing the surface of the earth in
maps; and they have to copy a small map of a group of hills.</p>

<p>The time allowed for each question is about three quarters of an hour
or an hour; for each German theme, it is as much as an hour and a half
or two hours.</p>

<p>The questions are of a comprehensive character; <i>e.g.</i> Give a
history of the campaign of 1813, or of the life of Alexander the Great;
enumerate the rivers flowing into the Mediterranean Sea, with the
principal towns situated upon each of them. The German themes are,
first, a <i>curriculum vitæ</i>, an account of the candidate’s life,
which is, however, not supposed to count in the result, and is merely
for the examiner’s information; second and third, two themes on some
sentence or proverb, for the first of which the examiner assists the
candidate by <i>vivâ voce</i> questions and corrections in drawing up
the preliminary outline of arrangement; for the second he is left
entirely to himself.</p>

<p>There is a subsequent <i>vivâ voce</i> examination in all the
subjects, drawing excepted. The candidates are taken in small classes,
not exceeding seven in number, and are examined together, but not in
public.</p>

<p>The results of the examination are considered according to the system
of <i>predicates</i> or epithets, sometimes also called <i>censures</i>.
The candidates’ answers are characterized as excellent
(<i>vorzüglich</i>,) good (<i>gut</i>,) satisfactory
(<i>befriedigend</i>,) insufficient (<i>nicht hinreichend</i>,) or
unsatisfactory (<i>ungenügend</i><ins class = "correction" title =
"closing ) missing">.)</ins> Numerical values are attached to each of
these epithets; “excellent” is marked with 9; “unsatisfactory” counts as
1; and according to the amount of importance attached to the different
subjects the marks thus given are multiplied by a higher or lower
number, by 5 in one case, by 3 or by 1 in others. German, Latin, and
mathematics have all the highest estimate of 5, and are each five times
more important than drawing, which is marked by 1; geography, history,
and French, are each valued at 3.&nbsp;A young man who gets the
<i>predicate</i> “excellent,” in German, will receive 45 marks, his 9
being multiplied by 5; whereas the same predicate for history would
obtain him only 15, and in drawing only 5 marks.</p>

</table>

<p>A report is then drawn up, and according to the marks or predicates,
the candidates are pronounced as admissible with distinction, admissible
with honor, or simply admissible; or their re-examination after six
months, their re-examination after a year, or their absolute rejection,
is recommended.</p>

<p>This report, with the candidates’ certificates, is forwarded to the
supreme military examinations board at Berlin, and, if approved by them,
is submitted in their quarterly report to the king; and the result, when
sanctioned by him, is communicated to the respective corps.</p>

<p>The candidates are all informed not only of the practical result, but
also of the particulars of their examinations; they are told in what
subjects they have failed, and in what they have succeeded. The
candidates can not, under any circumstances, try more than three
times.</p>

<p>The young men who pass, are thus, so far as their qualification in
point of knowledge is concerned, pronounced admissible to the ensign’s
grade. They have of course to complete their six months’ service with
the troops. Yet even when this is completed, a vacancy in the list of
ensigns must be waited for, and months may pass before the aspirant
receives the distinctive badge, the special Sword-knot, which marks his
superiority to the corporals, and shows that he has gained the first
step that leads to a commission.</p>

<p>The examination that has now been described is obviously one for
which preparation may be made in the common public schools, and under
the usual civilian teachers. A&nbsp;young man of seventeen need not have
been positively destined to the military profession, nor have gone
through special preparation for any length of time beforehand. The
boards of local military examiners are content to take them as they are
offered, inquiry only being made as to their birth and connections, and
their previous behavior at school or under tuition.</p>

<p>In fact, those who have passed successfully through the full course
of a school which prepares for the universities (a&nbsp;gymnasium,) are
excused the ensign’s examination. The certificate they have received on
going away from school, upon the <i>abiturient’s</i> or leaving
examination, as it is called, is considered quite sufficient; except in
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page301" id = "page301">301</a></span>
the case of candidates for the artillery or engineers, who are expected
to show greater proficiency in mathematics; and certainly a boy in the
head class of a gymnasium ought to be able to pass the preliminary
examination with perfect ease and with credit. The amount of knowledge
required and the particular subjects selected are not those of the
first, and are scarcely those of the second class of a gymnasium; and
the assertion was even made that a boy from the upper third class might
very well hope to pass for an ensigncy. Possibly a little extra tuition
from the preparatory establishments, which are said to have sprung up
with the special function of “fabricating Fähnrichs” might in this
instance be required.</p>

<p>The official programme is here given, and may be compared with the
studies prescribed in the upper classes of the Cadet House at Berlin,
(<i>see</i> the account of that school.)</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>1. In their own language, good legible handwriting, a correct style,
free from orthographical or grammatical mistakes, facility of expression
in writing and speaking; some evidence of a knowledge of German
literature.</p>

<p>2. In Latin, facility in understanding the Latin prose writers
ordinarily read in the second class of a Prussian gymnasium.
A&nbsp;written exercise in translation from Latin into German;
grammatical analysis of some passages.</p>

<p>3. In French, facility in reading and in translating from German into
French, and French into German, grammatical analysis of French
sentences, and a knowledge of syntax.</p>

<p>4. Mathematics:&mdash;</p>

<div class = "inlist">
<p>(<i>a.</i>) Arithmetic and Algebra;&mdash;familiarity with the
ordinary rules for the extraction of the square root of whole numbers
and of fractions; Proportion and its applications including questions in
Partnership and Compound Proportion; the theory of powers and roots,
with integral and fractional, positive and negative exponents. Equations
of the two first degrees, with one or more unknown quantities;
Logarithms, Logarithmic Equations, Arithmetical and Geometrical
Progression, and practice in the application of the various
theories.</p>

<p>(<i>b.</i>) The complete elements of Plane Geometry, measuration of
rectilineal figures and of the circle, transformation and division of
figures; the first elements of the application of Algebra to
Geometry.</p>

<p>(<i>c.</i>) Plane Trigonometry, Trigonometrical functions and their
Logarithms. Use of trigonometrical tables. Calculation of particular
cases of triangles, regular polygons, and segments of circles.</p>
</div>

<p>In consideration of the especial importance of this discipline for
officers of the artillery and engineers, a higher predicate (<i>i.e.</i>
a greater number of marks) will be required in the exercises of
candidates for these two services; the knowledge expected in their case
will be, though not more extensive, more thorough and deep.</p>

<p>5. Geography:&mdash;The general principles of Mathematical and
Physical Geography, knowledge of our planetary system, of the motions of
the Earth, and of the phenomena immediately dependent upon them.
Readiness in drawing from memory the outlines of the more important
countries, with their principal mountains, rivers, and cities. General
outlines of Political Geography, in the case of the mere states out of
Europe; a detailed account of the elements of European statistics, more
particularly in the case of Germany and Prussia.</p>

<p>6. History:&mdash;A knowledge of the more remarkable events in the
history of great nations, of the general connection, causes, and
consequences of these events; a knowledge of the remarkable men of all
such nations down to the present time. Special knowledge of the history
of Greece, Rome, Germany, Prussia, with particular reference in this
last case to its external growth, inner
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page302" id = "page302">302</a></span>
development, and to the principal events of the most important wars
since the middle of the eighteenth century.</p>

<p>7. Readiness in general drawing, and in constructing mathematical
figures; some skill in drawing plans of positions and mountains, in the
way of preparation for military plan drawing.</p>

<p>8. The candidate may, in addition, be examined in other subjects, in
which his certificates show that he has been instructed; for example, in
Natural Philosophy, so far as included in his previous course of
instruction.</p>
</div>

<p>It must be remembered that either before or after this examination
some months must be spent in actual service with the troops by all but
the pupils belonging to the <i>Selecta</i> of the cadet school; and that
nine months of study at the division and artillery and engineer schools
intervenes before the officers examination takes place.</p>


<h5 class = "fullsize"><a name = "prussia_exams_second" id =
"prussia_exams_second" href = "#prussia_exams">2. <i>The Second or
Officer’s Examination.</i></a></h5>

<p>The second or final examination for a commission, which generally
ensues when the work of the division school is over, is held in Berlin
only, and is conducted immediately by the central commission, to which
reference has so often been made&mdash;the supreme Military Examinations
Board, the <i>Ober-Militair-Examinations Commission</i>. This board or
commission, a list of the existing members of which is given in page
179, consists, for the purpose now in consideration, of a president and
five examiners, selected from the larger number to examine candidates
for commissions.</p>

<p>The examinations are held continually; two opportunities are afforded
every year to the candidates sent from each of the various army corps.
The requisite papers must be forwarded to the commission eight days at
least beforehand, and the candidates must appear in Berlin, and take up
their quarters in the buildings placed at the disposal of the board on
the Friday preceding the day fixed for the examination. The examination
usually begins on the following Monday, and lasts through the week. The
expenses of the journey are allowed, except, perhaps, when the candidate
comes up a second time.</p>

<p>The certificates to be presented are the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The certificate of birth, age, parentage, &amp;c. (This is called
the <i>Nationale</i>.)</p>

<p>2. The <i>Curriculum Vitæ</i>, (an account of the circumstances of
the candidates’s past life, his education, employment, &amp;c.,
&amp;c.)</p>

<p>3. The certificate that he has already passed through a previous
examination (the <i>Tentamen</i>,) held by the authorities of the
division school.</p>

<p>4. A certificate of conduct during his stay at the division
school.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page303" id = "page303">303</a></span>
<p>5. A military drawing (<i>Croquis</i>,) with an attestation given by
his instructor that it is the candidate’s own doing.</p>

<p>This examination, like the preliminary one, is partly on paper and
partly oral. General directions are given that the examiners in both
cases shall look mainly to the question whether the candidate has
sufficient positive knowledge of his subjects, and capacity to explain
and express himself, that mere lapses of memory shall not be regarded,
and that natural endowments shall be principally looked to.</p>

<p>In the written examination, the candidate has four questions given
him in what is called the knowledge or theory of arms
(<i>Waffenlehre</i>,) including under that term all kinds of ammunition;
three in tactics; one question in the rules and regulations which touch
the duty of a subaltern officer; two questions in permanent and two in
field fortification; one exercise in surveying, to test his acquaintance
with the common instruments, and one to try his knowledge of the
principles of plan drawing (<i>Terrain-Darstellung</i><ins class =
"correction" title = "closing ) missing">;)</ins> while his general
skill in military drawing is proved by his either copying a plan placed
before him, or drawing one from a relief model of a mountainous district
(<i>nach Bergmodellen</i>.)</p>

<p>There is a <i>vivâ voce</i> examination in all the subjects.</p>

<p>The commission meets once every month to consider the examinations
held since their last meeting. The result is announced under the form of
the <i>predicates</i> or epithets already more than once referred to.
Honorable mention is accorded to an <i>excellent</i> examination, and
mention to a <i>good</i> one. If there has been an unsatisfactory result
in one of the subjects, the candidate may compensate for it by
superiority in other subjects, but can only in this case be qualified as
<i>satisfactory (befriedigend,)</i> and an adequate knowledge of “arms”
and tactics is regarded as indispensable in candidates for the infantry
or cavalry, and in “arms” and fortification in those for the artillery
and engineers. No superior work in other subjects is allowed to make up
for a deficiency in these.</p>

<p>If a candidate’s work is marked as <i>insufficient (nicht
hinreichend,)</i> he is sent back for another half-year, and if he has
done <i>unsatisfactorily</i>, for a complete year of additional study,
with leave to appear for re-examination after that interval. In a case
of re-examination, the two last <i>predicates</i> (<i>nicht
hinreichend</i> and <i>ungenügend</i>) entail final rejection.</p>

<p>The report of the board is submitted to the king; the results are
communicated to the various corps. The announcements sent to the
candidates state the predicates assigned to the various portions of
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page304" id = "page304">304</a></span>
their work. Those who have passed, receive certificates of being
qualified for the second lieutenant’s commission:&mdash;</p>

<p>This rank, however, is not immediately granted. A vacancy may be long
in occurring, and must be waited for. Promotion is given according to
their seniority on the list of ensigns in the regiment. Another
condition must also be satisfied. When a vacancy occurs, the senior
ensign’s name can not be submitted to the king for his appointment
without a document stating on the part of the officers of the regiment
that he has the requisite knowledge of the duties of the service, and
that they consider him worthy of admission amongst them (<i>würdig in
seine Mitte zu treten</i>.) If the majority is opposed to his admission,
the name of the next ensign in order of seniority is, without further
discussion, brought forward; if a minority or merely some individual
officers take exception, they state the grounds of their opinion, which
are then submitted for consideration.<a class = "tag" name = "tag2_6" id
= "tag2_6" href = "#note2_6">6</a></p>

<p>Special merit in the examination may be, at the king’s pleasure, held
a sufficient reason for promotion before all candidates examined at the
same time.</p>

is expected of candidates at the second or officer’s
examination:&mdash;</p>

which an account will shortly follow, and to which any young man once

<h5 class = "fullsize"><a name = "prussia_officers_cadet" id =
"prussia_officers_cadet" href = "#prussia_officers"><i>The Cadet Schools
or Cadet Houses.</i></a></h5>

<p>The actual military education of Prussia commences with the cadet
houses, the schools intended for pupils before entering the army. They
are divided into two classes, the junior and the senior. They can not
indeed be called exclusively military schools, since the education which
most of their pupils receive is one which fits them for civil
professions, and is not specially military; and there is no obligation
even on those who have received the largest amount of pecuniary
assistance to enter the military profession when they leave the cadet
house. The highest class, however, of the Upper Cadet School of Berlin,
called the <i>Selecta</i>, receives strictly military teaching for a
year, and the schools may fairly come under this denomination, as being
mainly intended to educate the sons of officers who are in want of
assistance, and as possessing a military discipline, uniform, and
spirit.</p>

<p>These are five in number, four preparatory schools, and one a
finishing institution; the four first in the provinces, at Culm,
Potsdam, Wahlstatt, and Bensberg, the last in the capital itself. At the
four junior schools, boys may be admitted at 10 or 11, and may remain
till 15; at the upper school the ordinary stay is from 15 or 16 to 18 or
19.</p>

<p>The whole constitute together a single body, called the cadet corps.
Boys may enter the school at Berlin on passing an examination, without
previously attending one of the lower schools; but those who are sent up
by the authorities from Culm, Potsdam, Wahlstatt, and Bensberg, are
received without examination, being already members of the corps.
A&nbsp;single officer exercises the command of the whole; and a single
commission, of which the general inspector is chairman, regulates all
matters relating to the admission of candidates into the body.</p>

<p>The whole number at present is between 1,100 and 1,200, of whom 420
are in the Upper School at Berlin, 205 in the Preparatory School at
Potsdam, and 200 at each of the other houses.</p>

<p>The cadets are of two kinds, the King’s cadets and the Pensioners
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page311" id = "page311">311</a></span>
or paying pupils; the former are 720 in number, the latter about 420.
The pensioners pay 200 dollars (30<i>l.</i>) a year for board and
instruction together; the King’s cadets are aided in various degrees
accordingly to the following scale:&mdash;</p>

<table class = "plaintext reduced">
<tr>
<td>240 pay 30 dollars (4<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i>) each.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>240 pay 60 dollars (9<i>l.</i>) each.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>240 pay 100 dollars (15<i>l.</i>) each.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Foreigners are admissible at a yearly payment of 300 dollars
(45<i>l.</i>,) and a few extra day scholars (<i>Hospitanten</i>,) when
the classes are not too full, are received for 20 dollars a year
(3<i>l.</i>)</p>

<p>The King’s cadetships are granted, according to the pecuniary
circumstances of the applicants, to the children of officers of the
standing army, or of the Landwehr, who have distinguished themselves or
have been invalided in actual service in the field; to the children of
non-commissioned officers who have in like manner distinguished
themselves and received severe wounds in the service; and to those of
any citizens who have performed any special service to the state. The
sons of meritorious officers who have died in indigence or have retired
upon pensions, the sons of indigent officers in general in the standing
army, and the sons of meritorious non-commissioned officers of
twenty-five years’ standing, are also in like manner eligible.</p>

<p>In very special cases of poverty, the supplementary payment is
dispensed with altogether.</p>

<p>Pensioners are admitted from all classes and professions according to
priority of application, and to their qualifications as shown by their
examination. A&nbsp;great number of these are said to be the sons of
officers, of those, namely, who are not in need of pecuniary assistance.
And the number of the pensioners generally appears to be steadily on the
increase. In the regulations printed in 1850, the places open for this
class of cadets are stated to be only 216; at present, as has been seen,
provision is made for something like double that number.</p>

<p>The four junior schools at Culm, Potsdam, Wahlstatt, and Bensberg,
are all divided for purposes of instruction upon the same uniform plan
into four classes, numbered up from six to three&mdash;<i>Sexta</i> at
the bottom; <i>Quinta</i>; <i>Quarta</i>; and <i>Tertia</i> at the top.
The upper school at Berlin succeeds with three classes, the second, the
first, and the special or select&mdash;<i>Secunda</i>, <i>Prima</i>, and
<i>Selecta</i>. Each of these classes, however, may contain any number
of co-ordinate subdivisions, all taught the same subjects, and presumed
to contain pupils of the same capacity. No teacher, it is considered,
can satisfactorily
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page312" id = "page312">312</a></span>
undertake to give a lesson to more than thirty at a time; and the
Secunda at Berlin was thus parted out in the year ending March, 1856,
into eight little sets of rather less than thirty, the Prima into six,
and the Selecta into two.</p>


<p class = "heading"><a name = "prussia_officers_junior" id =
"prussia_officers_junior" href = "#prussia_officers_cadet"><i>Junior
Cadet House.</i></a></p>

<p>The junior cadet house at Potsdam occupies four or five buildings a
little way out of the town. The class-rooms are on the usual Prussian
plan, not arranged for lectures to large, but for lessons with small
numbers. One distinguishing feature is the character of the arrangements
of the rooms up-stairs, in which the boys pass their time out of school
hours. They are very comfortable chambers, perhaps rather small for the
numbers at present placed in them; they are ranged along a corridor; ten
pupils are placed in each, and between every two rooms is the apartment
of one of the resident tutors (<i>Erzieher</i> or <i>Gouverneur</i>,)
who sees that all goes on right in these two rooms under his charge.
Here the boys sit and work, and during the hours when they are expected
to be preparing their lessons, are carefully looked after by their
tutors.</p>

<p>These little apartments occupy one whole floor of the building. The
floor above is that of the dormitories, containing each, perhaps, as
many as sixty. The number at present in the school was stated to be two
hundred and five, and the accommodation properly intended for only one
hundred and sixty.</p>

<p>Colonel von Rosenberg, the commandant of the school, stated that
eleven was the usual age at which the pupils came. This he appeared to
think was rather too early, and he was inclined to attribute to this
cause certain points in the character of young men who have been
educated in the cadet corps. Eighty of his two hundred and five pupils
were pensioners, or paying pupils; many of these also were the sons of
officers. The teachers and tutors are partly civilians and partly
military men, about an equal number of each. The four classes, Tertia,
Quarta, Quinta, and Sexta, are subdivided into nine, so that the average
number at a lesson would not be more <ins class = "correction" title =
"text has ‘that’">than</ins> twenty-three.</p>


<p class = "heading"><a name = "prussia_officers_senior" id =
"prussia_officers_senior" href = "#prussia_officers_cadet"><i>Senior
Cadet House.</i></a></p>

<p>The upper or central cadet school is in the older part of Berlin, in
the <i>Neue Friedrichs Strasse</i>, where on the pediment surmounting
the gateway the inscription, <span class = "smallroman">MARTIS ET
MINERVÆ ALUMNIS M.DCC. LXXVI</span>, records the erection by Frederick
the Great, ten years before his death, of the large and stately
quadrangle which formed the original house. Here the pupils are
quartered, and in the great
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page313" id = "page313">313</a></span>
court within, they go through their exercises. There are several houses
on both sides of the street attached to the service of the institution,
and buildings are in course of erection to accommodate additional
numbers.</p>

<p>A large separate building contains the present class-rooms. In the
first of these which we visited, thirty cadets were engaged in military
drawing; in another, twenty-four of the second class, the Secunda, were
busy at their Latin lesson.</p>

<p>The room was fitted up on what appears to be the usual plan, with a
series of parallel desks on the same level, ranged along the outer wall,
and a sufficient space between them and the inner wall for the teacher
to pass freely up and down. His desk was at one end in front of the
boys. The lesson was in Quintus Curtius. The teacher (a&nbsp;civilian)
made them construe each a sentence, and asked questions in parsing,
&amp;c., &amp;c., much in the English manner. There was no taking
places. This in German schools appears to be confined to quite the lower
classes. There is a separate lecture-room here again for lessons on
Natural Philosophy and Chemistry, with a small gallery of models,
instruments, &amp;c., attached to it.</p>

<p>A large hall is used on state occasions, and serves the purpose also
of an examination-room; it is called the hall of the Field Marshals, and
is adorned with portraits of the sovereigns of Prussia from the Great
Elector downwards, and of the field marshals both of the time of
Frederick the Great and of more recent date, among whom is the Duke of
Wellington. Here also is kept Napoleon’s sword taken at “La Belle
Alliance,” and presented by Marshal Blucher.</p>

<p>Passing to the first floor of the great quadrangular building, we
found ourselves in one of the sitting-rooms of the cadets. Seven boys
had a couple of rooms, consisting of a common sitting-room, and a common
bed-room. Five is the number for which this amount of accommodation was
intended, and to five the number will be reduced when the new buildings
are completed. In a second and larger pair of rooms we found twelve
boys.</p>

<p>Here also is the library, containing 10,000 volumes, and comfortable
apartments occupied by the various superintending officers.</p>

<p>The boys, their morning lessons completed, had been going through
their military exercises under the superintendence of their officers;
but they were now collected in their studying-rooms, and were seen
forming at the doors, each small party under the command of its senior,
ready to march into the large and handsome dinner-hall.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page314" id = "page314">314</a></span>
<p>Into this the whole body of young men presently moved by companies,
proceeding to station themselves in front of the tables. The tables are
ranged in parallel lines on each side of the central passage, and
accommodate each of them ten, four sitting at each side, and a senior at
each end. The order was given by the officer on duty for “prayer”
(<i>Nun beten wir</i>,) and a short silent grace was followed by the
immediate occupation of the seats, and the commencement of the meal. The
arrangements in general appeared to be excellent.</p>

<p>The number in the school during the past year had been 420. The four
companies into which the whole body of the pupils is divided, each
contain a certain proportion from each of the three classes; the senior
in each company being invested with the charge of the juniors; those who
are in the Selecta taking rank as under officers. In every room
(<i>Stube</i> or <i>Wohnzimmer</i>) there is one <i>Selectaner</i>, who
is responsible. The ordinary ages are 15, 16 in the Secunda; 16, 17 in
the Prima, and as far as 19 in the Selecta. No one is, as a rule,
allowed to pass more than one year in a class; if in that time he can
not qualify himself for advancement, he is dismissed. The rule does not,
however, appear to be strictly enforced. The general preservation of
discipline appears to be a good deal intrusted, as in English public
schools, to these senior pupils of the age of eighteen or nineteen.
There are Resident Tutors (<i>Erziehers</i> or <i>Gouverneurs</i>) as at
Potsdam, who see a good deal of the pupils, especially in the evenings,
when they go into the sitting-rooms, sit with them, help them in their
work, play at chess with them, &amp;c., &amp;c. But they do not sleep
close at hand between the sets of rooms, as at Potsdam, but at some
little distance off.</p>

<p>The official arrangements for the control of the discipline consist
principally in the system of what are called <i>Censur</i> Classes. This
is a peculiar system which requires some explanation. There are five
<i>Censur</i> Classes quite independent of the ordinary classes of the
school. A&nbsp;boy on entering the Cadet School is always placed in the
third of these classes; if he behaves ill, he falls to Class IV. and is
under restrictions. Class V. is reserved for serious cases of
misconduct, and any one who incurs the penalty of descending to it, is
subject to continual superintendence, and is confined to the walls.
Class II. gives considerable, and Class I. still more ample privileges.
The members of this class (usually only quite the elder boys) are
allowed great freedom in the way of going out into the town.</p>

<p>In each of the studying-rooms (the <i>Wohnzimmer</i>) the list of the
occupants’ names hangs up on the door inside. One for example
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page315" id = "page315">315</a></span>
was noticed containing twelve names. To each was attached his rank in
the <i>Censur</i> Classes, as well as his position in the ordinary
classes. At the head stood one <i>Selectaner</i>, who in this instance
was in charge of the room; then followed the <i>Primaners</i>; and the
list was completed by nine of the <i>Secunda</i>. As at the time of our
visit (just after the Easter holidays and the yearly examination) the
whole Selecta of the year had just quitted, the room was in the charge
of the senior <i>Primaner</i>. The authority exercised by these senior
boys appears to be very considerable.</p>

<p>The competition for admission to the Selecta, and for the after
selection for immediate promotion, was spoken of as very
considerable.</p>

<p>The number who came to the Berlin Cadet House without previously
going to one of the junior establishments was said to be only a small
per-centage.</p>

<p>The boys both here and at Potsdam were of course all found dressed in
a military uniform.</p>

<p>The studies pursued in the Cadet Corps agree nearly with those of the
common public schools, but of these there are three different
kinds:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The ordinary first-class school, the <i>gymnasium</i> of the
Prussian States, is, strictly speaking, a school which prepares for the
universities.</p>

<p>2. The second-class schools have the name of <i>Real</i> or
<i>Practical Schools</i>; they deal with the actual application to
business and work, not with the theory of mathematics or of language,
and they may be said to resemble in some degree the schools occasionally
attached in English towns to Mechanics’ Institutes, or in the United
States, to the Public English High School or the Higher Department of a
Union School. Young men who have passed successfully through a gymnasium
may be admitted to the army without passing the preliminary or
<i>Portepée-fähnrich</i> examination. Those who complete their time at a
<i>Real</i> School have not hitherto been allowed the same
privilege.</p>

<p>3. There is a third and intermediate class called a <i>Real</i> or
<i>Practical Gymnasium</i>, and to this, according to the statements of
the official books, the courses of the Cadet Schools have hitherto
corresponded. It appears, however, that there is only one specimen of
the <i>Real Gymnasium</i> now in existence, the Coëln School in the old
town of Berlin. The system here is said to be more practical than the
<i>Gymnasium</i>, and less professional or mechanical than the <i>Real
School</i>.</p>

<p>It is intended during the present year to assimilate the course of
instruction at the Cadet Schools more nearly to that followed at the
<i>Gymnasium</i> or University School; the studies of the senior Cadet
School at Berlin will be raised to a higher standard, but Greek and
Hebrew, which are taught in all gymnasiums, will not be introduced.</p>

<p>The Selecta, the Military Class, corresponds with the classes of the
Division Schools, and with the first year’s course of the Artillery and
Engineers’ School.</p>

<p>The plan pursued, both as regards, first, the subjects taught, and
second, the amount of time, is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>The instruction consists throughout, from <i>Sexta</i> up to
<i>Prima</i>, of lessons in Latin, German, French, Arithmetic, History,
Geography. Natural History begins in the <i>Quinta</i>, at 12 or 13
years old, with Botany and Zoölogy; Mineralogy follows, at 14 or 15;
Natural Philosophy at 15 or 16.&nbsp;The first elements of drawing, with
the use of rulers, compasses, &amp;c., begins also in <i>Quinta</i>, at
12 or 13.&nbsp;Practice in regular plan-drawing is gradually and
increasingly given in every year. The first elements of geometry are
taught in the <i>Quarta</i>, and Euclid I. 47. <i>Pythagoras</i>, has to
be mastered at 14 years old. Theoretical Arithmetic, in combination with
Algebra, is commenced apparently in the <i>Tertia</i>.</p>

<p>The subjects taught in the <i>Secunda</i>, <i>Prima</i>, and
<i>Selecta</i>, that is, the course of the Upper School at Berlin, has
hitherto been as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p class = "heading"><i>In the Secunda:</i></p>

<p>Quintus Curtius, Cicero’s Orations, and Ovid’s Metamorphoses; in

<p>The lessons appear to be going on from 8 to 11 or 12 in the morning,
and from 2 to 4 or 5 in the evening. The pupils have two hours’ drill
twice a week. They get up at half-past 5, have breakfast, and an hour’s
preparation before lessons begin. There are similar hours of study in
the evening from 6 to 8; and some of the pupils also take private
lessons from the teachers.<a class = "tag" name = "tag2_7" id = "tag2_7"
href = "#note2_7">7</a> During these special hours of study
(<i>Arbeitstunde</i>,) the chambers are visited by the officers and
tutors, assistance is given and diligence enforced. From 8 to half-past
9 they study as they please; the tutors are a good deal with them in the
rooms; at 10 all are in bed. Wednesday and Saturday are half holidays;
on Sunday they
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page318" id = "page318">318</a></span>
attend morning service in the garrison church, and after that is over,
are allowed to be more or less absent in the town, to be with their
parents, relations, and friends.</p>

<p>For the 420 cadets of the Institution at Berlin, there appear to be
about twenty professors and teachers not residing in the school, the
majority of whom are civilians; and in addition to these, twenty tutors
and superintendents resident in the buildings. Of these, sixteen are
military officers, half of whom are permanently attached to the corps,
and half on duty from various regiments, and four are civilians. The
cadets being divided into four companies, each containing so many of the
Selecta, so many of the Prima, and so many of the Secunda, to each of
these companies are attached one captain, one first-lieutenant, and two
second-lieutenants, all of whom, however, take some part in the
instruction; and one civilian (<i>Civil-Erzieher</i>) is added with the
especial duty of looking after and assisting the studies of the cadets
of the company.</p>

<p>The holidays are one month in summer (in July and August,) ten days
or a fortnight at Christmas, eight days at Easter, and four at
Whitsuntide.</p>

<p>The rules for the entrance of cadets into the army are as
follows:&mdash;Those who complete their year in the Prima are considered
to be sufficiently prepared for ordinary admission. They are sent in to
an examination before the Supreme Examinations Board (the
<i>Ober-Militair-Examinations-Commission</i>) before examiners entirely
independent of and unconnected with the instruction of the cadets; and
the majority, if they pass, are admitted simply as
<i>Portepée-fähnriche</i>, on the same conditions as the young men
already spoken of who enter upon the recommendation merely of the
commanding officer of a regiment and the approval of the commanding
officer of an army corps. Like these, they serve in the regiment, they
attend the Division Schools, and in due time offer themselves for
examination for a commission.</p>

<p>Out of this number, however, the sixty who do best are retained, and
reserved to receive in the special military class of the Cadet School
the instruction which the others are to seek in the Division Schools.
These remain another year in the Cadet House, and undergo at its close,
before leaving the Cadet House, their officers’ examination before the
Supreme Board. The thirty best are once more selected, and receive
immediate promotion. Their patents are signed and they join their
regiments at once as second-lieutenants. The other thirty, if they have
satisfied the examiners, receive a certificate of qualification, and
enter with the rank of <i>Portepée-fähnrich</i>,
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page319" id = "page319">319</a></span>
and with, the prospect of receiving commissions without further
examination, as soon as vacancies occur. Any one who fails to pass his
examination must enter, if at all, simply with the rank of
<i>Portepée-fähnrich</i>, and has to qualify himself in the Division
Schools for attempting a second time the examination for the officer’s
patent.</p>

<p>Such is the system as recently modified. Till quite lately only
thirty were promoted from the Prima to the Selecta, and these thirty,
unless they failed wholly, obtained immediate commissions at the end of
the year. It has been found desirable to introduce the stimulus of
competition, to offer a definite reward in the way of superior
advantages to the best students, and to make it obviously worth a young
man’s while to exert himself, and to be thoroughly diligent during this
final year in the Selecta at the Cadet School.</p>

<p>Young men who, after passing the examination in the Prima, desire to
enter the artillery and engineers, follow the usual course leading to
the Artillery and Engineers’ School. They enter an artillery regiment,
or a division of the engineers; they serve for nine months, they enter
the special school, they are eligible after the first quarter to the
grade of <i>Portepée-fähnrich</i>, and at the close of their first year
are examined for their lieutenant’s commission. Those who remain in the
Selecta have the great advantage of passing from the Cadet School
immediately into the Artillery and Engineers’ School as lieutenants, and
commence their course there accordingly at the beginning of the second
of the three years. As, however, the school-year closes at the end of
April, in the Cadet Houses, and begins in the Artillery and Engineers’
School on the 1st of October, these select cadets also pass five months
with their regiment in actual service before recommencing their
studies.</p>

<p>The average number who pass in this manner into the Artillery and
Engineers’ School is stated by the authorities of the Cadet House to be
three annually from the Selecta, and six or eight from the Prima.</p>

<p>It can hardly have escaped observation, that the studies pursued as a
qualification for entering the army are, with the exception of the
Selecta, almost entirely non-professional, even here in this part of the
general system, which is in other respects most military in its
character; and the tendency seems to be to carry out to a still greater
extent the theory of continuing to as late an age as possible a good
general education. There is evidently a general desire in Prussia, to
take the officers of the standing army exclusively from the
well-educated or the higher classes.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page320" id = "page320">320</a></span>
<p>In the arrangements for the lessons, the very temperate or even timid
use of the stimulus of competition deserves to be noticed. It appears,
however, to have been lately employed with advantage in the highest
class. At the same time, the provision made for giving really good
instruction, and for placing all the boys in close relation with their
teachers, can not but excite admiration. The small numbers of which the
classes consist, and the care which seems to be taken in providing good
teachers, both deserve attention.</p>

<p>The domestic arrangements, without being remarkable for the
scrupulous cleanliness or the magnitude of the new institutions in
Austria, certainly in some respects are more in accordance with English
feelings. The greater privacy afforded by the use of rooms where few
live together, is certainly more analogous to what has been found most
desirable for English boys in large English schools, though most likely
the contrary system is not less well-adapted to the national character
in France and in Austria.</p>


<h5 class = "fullsize"><a name = "prussia_officers_division" id =
"prussia_officers_division" href = "#prussia_officers"><i>2. The
Division Schools.</i></a></h5>

<p>There are nine Division Schools for the whole army, one for each army
corps, and they are placed at the following towns:&mdash;</p>

<p>Potsdam, Königsberg, Stettin, Frankfort on the Oder, Erfurt, Glogan,
Neisse, Münster, and Trèves.</p>

<p>Here the young aspirant finds himself with nine or ten companions and
a body of teachers amounting to about half that number, appointed by the
commanding officer of the army corps, and differing considerably in
different districts in their talents and ideas of education. They are
often, though not always, selected from officers who have been at the
Staff School, and afterwards at the Topographical Bureau. Their
additional pay for teaching is uncertain; it depends upon the surplus
remaining after the expenses of the household, and the money paid in
purchasing books, instruments, &amp;c., is deducted from the yearly
allowance made to the school by the government. At best it is not high.
It is calculated by the number of lectures, and at the most amounts to
something more than 4<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i> (30&nbsp;thalers) for the
lectures on a single subject, given, it must be remembered, during the
course of little more than six months in the year. The highest pay given
in the Potsdam School to any one professor amounted to something more
than 15 <i>l.</i> (100 thalers) yearly for lectures on three subjects,
averaging ten or twelve lectures weekly for about six months. This must
be estimated by a Prussian, not an English standard, being nearly
equivalent to five-twelfths of the annual pay of a second lieutenant in
that service.
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page321" id = "page321">321</a></span>
Still the sum is very low; and this, with some other obvious
deficiencies, injures the working of the schools.</p>

<p>The young candidate for a commission begins a course of Tactics,
Fortification, theory of Drawing and Surveying, Military Literature,
Artillery, &amp;c., Military Essays, and Drawing of Plans, which must be
finished at the school in nine months, although it may be continued
longer in private if the candidate is not prepared to pass his
examination. As long as it lasts, twenty-three hours a week are devoted
to study, besides the time occupied by questions, which the teachers are
required to set from time to time, in order to keep up the pupil’s
previous knowledge of French and Mathematics. The course is divided into
the purely theoretical and practical divisions, the first of six and a
half months, the latter of two and a half. We have already given a very
full account of the studies in p. 188.</p>

<p>The arrangement of studies is systematic, and the number of hours
devoted each week to lectures on the various subjects of study and to
gymnastic riding and fencing, is as follows:</p>

<p>The lecturer has to draw up what is called the thread of the lecture
(<i>leitfaden</i>,) a sort of programme containing its leading heads,
intended to assist the memory of the pupils in giving a full account of
it afterwards; and the contents of the different lectures on Tactics,
Arms and Munitions, Fortifications, &amp;c., are written out very
minutely by the students. Ten pages of close print are devoted to these
programmes in Helldorf; and the translation already given
(pp.&nbsp;188-194) will show that the list of military subjects adverted
to is considerable.</p>

<p>At the end of the nine months spent at the Division School, the
“<i>Officier Aspiranten</i>” go to Berlin for the examination for their
commission. If they can not pass this, they return to study by
themselves for their second trial. Unless by special permission from the
King, they can not try more than twice.</p>

<p>The examination is conducted by the Supreme Commission for
Examinations at Berlin, and has been already described.</p>

<p>The Division Schools were founded at the end of the great War. Their
germ appears in Scharnhorst’s general order in 1810, which, among other
things, instituted three War Schools for the candidate for commissions
(<i>Portepée-fähnriche</i>.) These three War Schools seem to have been
changed into the Division Schools in 1813 and 1816. At first, indeed,
they were much more numerous than at present, as their name implies,
there being two Divisions to each Army-Corps. There are now, as we have
mentioned, nine; and Corps School or Army-Corps School would be the more
correct designation.</p>

<p>Their importance as the institutions for special military instruction
to all “<i>Officier-Aspiranten</i>” of the army led us to inquire
carefully with regard to their efficiency, and in particular from two
distinguished officers, on whose judgment and scientific experience
great reliance might be placed. One of these, it may be added, possessed
constant means of knowing all the details respecting them.</p>

<p>I. Formerly, it appears, it was not possible to limit these schools
to their true object, purely military instruction. This was the special
object of their creation; but owing to the defective <i>general</i>
education which candidates often brought with them into the army, the
Division Schools were too much used as a means of meeting this
deficiency.</p>

<p>II. The opinions we obtained were certainly not favorable with regard
to the present efficiency of these schools. It seemed to be agreed, that
from various reasons, the military education given was
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page323" id = "page323">323</a></span>
susceptible of much improvement; that some of the Division Schools were
really defective in teaching, whilst none could be pointed to as
strikingly good. But it was also admitted that these blemishes arose
from remediable defects in the working of the schools; that their
principle was in itself sound, and capable of being carried out more
perfectly, and excellently adapted to the object of giving some military
instruction to all desirous of becoming officers of the infantry and
cavalry.</p>

<p>III. The causes assigned for the present defects in the efficiency of
the Division Schools were chiefly the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>(<i>a.</i>) That they were far too numerous.</p>

<p>Educated and scientific as Prussia may be called, it is not found
practicable to supply <i>nine</i> army schools with exactly the sort of
men fitted for the work of education. The pay, it must be added, is
insufficient to attract many, and thus (as&nbsp;we were informed,)
although many officers of intelligence are sometimes not unwilling to
leave the life of drill for the life of education for a year or two, few
do so with the serious purpose of doing it <i>well</i>. Neither the
position nor the emoluments tempt them to make it a profession. Officers
in command of the district have made the appointments, and often have
“good-naturedly,” as it was said, appointed unfit persons, known as
studious men.</p>

<p>(<i>b.</i>) The small number of pupils in each school was also spoken
of as a very great disadvantage, as doing away with all emulation
amongst themselves.</p>

<p>(<i>c.</i>) The independence which each school has enjoyed, and the
want of any central body to watch its working and regulate its system,
is also said to have had bad results. The teaching has been far from
uniform,&mdash;in one school energetic, in another lax; in one school
the most important subjects taught, in another, a little of everything;
in a third, some special crotchet of a teacher. This has acted badly on
the examinations, since it was thought hard to reject an
“<i>aspirant</i>” who had done parts of his work well, and had been
evidently ill taught or superficially instructed in others.</p>

<p>The remedies suggested were,&mdash;</p>

<p>(1.) Considerably to diminish the number of these schools. This, we
were told, was about to be done by reducing them from <i>nine</i> to
<i>three</i>. Such a course would obviously tend to remedy two of the
evils complained of. It would give a larger choice of teachers, and
afford more liberal means of remunerating them, and a larger attendance
and competition of pupils.</p>

<p>(2.) To place the schools under the more direct regulation and
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page324" id = "page324">324</a></span>
management of the Central Educational Department at Berlin. This step
would improve their teaching by subjecting it to constant inspection and
reports. It would insure uniformity in the system of instruction and
subjects of study; and, when combined with the presence of able
teachers, it would enable the Board of Examiners at Berlin to pursue a
more strict and unvarying course in rejecting ill-qualified candidates.
By these means the teaching in the school would probably become more
definite and higher.</p>

<p>One other point was mentioned to us as doubtful. It was thought that
the time for attending the Division School came too soon after a young
man’s entrance into the army, when he had but recently obtained his
liberty, and was likely to be much more unwilling to be sent to school
again than might have been the case a year or two later. General von
Willisen, who urged this objection to us, was consequently for deferring
the attendance at the Division Schools several years in an officer’s
life.</p>

<p>We should add, however, that as in Prussia a young
<i>Officier-aspirant</i> is still partly a private soldier, we were told
that many were glad to exchange the severity of regimental discipline
for the Division School.</p>


<h5 class = "fullsize"><a name = "prussia_officers_united" id =
"prussia_officers_united" href = "#prussia_officers"><i>3. The United
Artillery and Engineers’ School at Berlin.</i></a></h5>

<p>Young men desirous of obtaining commissions in the Artillery or
Engineers follow the course which has already been described. They join
either with a nomination from a colonel of artillery or engineers, or as
scholars from the Cadet House. They submit themselves for examination
for the grade of Ensign (<i>Portepée-fähnrich</i>); they serve their
time with the troops, they go through a course of professional study,
and are examined in it for their officer’s commission by the Board at
Berlin. If they come from the highest class, the <i>Selecta</i> of the
Cadet House, they have the privilege of joining the corps with the rank
of officer.</p>

<p>In these respects the system is the same for them as for the
<i>Aspiranten</i> in the other arms of the service.</p>

<p>The distinctions are, that first, in the preliminary or Ensign’s
Examination, a somewhat greater acquaintance with mathematics is
required from them; secondly, that they prepare for the Officer’s
Examination, and follow their professional studies, not in the Division
Schools, but in a separate Special Arm School at Berlin. Moreover, nine
months’ service with the troops, instead of six, is required before they
can enter the Special Arm School. They enter it also with the rank only
of corporal, and are not eligible to the
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page325" id = "page325">325</a></span>
grade of Swordknot Ensign until they have passed three months at least
in the school.</p>

<p>Their Officer’s Examination before the Supreme Board at Berlin takes
place after nine months more, at the end of the first year at the
school, and after passing they are eligible to the rank of officer.</p>

<p>When a vacancy occurs their claim to an actual commission is
considered, and the usual formalities are fulfilled. Their names are
submitted for approval to the officers of the corps, and with that
approbation laid before the King; and they thus in due time obtain their
rank as Sub-Lieutenants respectively of Artillery or of Engineers.</p>

<p>This rank, however, is provisional, and their position is that of
supernumeraries. Their education as officers may be complete, but their
education as officers of Artillery or of Engineers has scarcely in fact
commenced. They have before them a third examination, that of the
Special Arm, their <i>Vocation-trial</i> or <i>Berufs-prüfung</i>. Or,
more correctly speaking, they have not one but two to pass, for the
third examination is divided into two stages, one to be passed at the
end of each of the two years which yet remain of the course. It is only
when these are completed, after a three years’ stay, that the young man
is finally allowed to join his corps as a second-lieutenant.</p>

<p>Failure in the officers’ examination at the close of the first year
is attended with the penalty of returning to the corps and resuming
service in the ranks with the troops. Whether or not the rejected
student may be permitted to return after an interval to join again the
classes of the first year, or after passing, upon a second trial, the
officers’ examination, to enter the classes of the second year, will
depend upon the extent of his failure.</p>

<p>Failure in the examination at the close of the second year is
similarly visited with the punishment of return to the corps. As they
have already passed the officers’ examination, they may endeavor to
effect a transfer to a regiment of the line; or, under certain
circumstances, they may be permitted to study privately in preparation
for the third year’s course, and may offer themselves for a second
trial.</p>

<p>If a student fails in his last examination at the close of the third
year, he may be allowed, in like manner, under favorable circumstances,
to re-enter the third year’s classes, and try to qualify himself by an
additional year of study, losing, of course, his seniority. Otherwise,
he joins the corps as a supernumerary, with the pay of an infantry
officer, and waits till he can obtain a commission in the line.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page326" id = "page326">326</a></span>
<p>Candidates for commissions in the engineers enter the corps, it
should be observed, originally as volunteers, finding their own
clothing, and receiving no pay; but as soon as they enter the school
they are regularly paid by the state, and receive their pay in the usual
course of the service from the division to which they belong.</p>

<p>The studies of the three years are arranged in accordance with the
system that has just been described. Those of the first year are common
to the two arms, and correspond, in a general way, with what is taught
in the Division Schools or in the highest class of the Cadet House.
Those of the second year are devoted to the special arm subjects. In
Mathematics, Artillery, and Fortification, the lectures are common to
the artillery and engineers; in drawing they are divided.</p>

<p>In the third year a considerable separation takes place. Mathematics
are still taught, and there is a special class of the most advanced
students in the Differential and Integral Calculus, the Higher Geometry,
and in Analytical Mechanics and Hydraulics; this, however, is purposely
restricted to about one-third of the class, by raising the requirements,
if necessary.</p>

<p>The course is divided in each year into the theoretical and the
practical part. The year commences in October with the former, and the
studies for the nine months succeeding are for the most part theoretical
only. In June the examinations take place. July, August, and a part of
September are given up to practical exercises. Something like the last
three weeks of September are allowed for a vacation.</p>

<p>The general control of the school is in the hands of the General
Inspectors of the two services, the artillery and the engineers. These
two are the <i>Curators</i> of the school and form the
<i>Curatorium</i>. They make their reports to the General Inspector of
Military Education, of whom mention has already been made. The immediate
management is intrusted to a director, who is a field officer of
artillery or engineers, of the rank of commandant of a regiment, and he
has a captain, appointed by the <ins class = "correction"
title = "text has ‘Cutatorium’"><i>Curatorium</i></ins> as his assistant.</p>

<p>There is a Board of Studies, of which the Director is chairman,
consisting of the Senior Professor of Mathematics, of the Instructors of
Artillery and Engineering in the third Cœtus, and of an equal number of
officers of the two services named by the Curators.</p>

<p>Four officers, three from the artillery and one from the engineers,
acting under the captain, are charged with the care of discipline and
order; these are the <i>Direction</i> Officers.</p>

<p>There are twelve military and eleven civilian professors and
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page327" id = "page327">327</a></span>
<ins class = "correction"
title = "text has ‘ers’ (only) after page break">teachers.</ins> Among the military professors and teachers may be
included any of the direction officers.</p>

<p>The examinations of the first year are conducted by the usual Board,
the Supreme Military Examinations Board; but for those of the second and
of the third year, there is a separate board, chosen from the two
services by the Curators, and otherwise unconnected with the School.</p>

<p>The numbers in the school vary from 216 to 240. In time of peace
about five are yearly admitted for each regiment of artillery, and two
or three for each division of engineers. The great majority have entered
the army from the usual places of civil education, a few from the Prima
of the Cadet House, on the same terms as the others, and a small number,
who are usually among the best pupils in the school, from the Selecta,
who come as officers, and after a short service with the troops, enter
the second year’s classes, provided there is room, preference being
always allowed to the students already belonging to the school, who have
succeeded in passing the examination of the first year.</p>

<p>The Artillery and Engineers’ School buildings stand in Berlin itself,
in the principal street, <i>Unter den Linden</i>, No. 74, near the
Brandenburg Gate. They bear the following inscription: <i>Artillerie und
Ingenieur Schule. Stiftung Friedrich Wilhelms</i> III. M.DCCC.XXII.</p>

<p>On the occasion of our visit to the school, we were allowed by the
kindness of the authorities to be present at some of the lectures. The
students of the second year were attending the course on the History of
the Art of War, and the immediate subject was an account of and
criticism on the battle of Blenheim. The young men, about forty-five in
number, were ranged in desks facing the Professor, but not in the manner
of an amphitheater. The lecture was interesting, animated, and generally
instructive; it was perfectly professorial in character, and the young
men took notes. A&nbsp;class of the students of the first year,
thirty-five in number, were engaged in topographical drawing. The
artillery division of the third year students were in another room,
listening to and busily taking notes upon a lecture (also professorial)
on the construction of gun-carriages: the number was about
forty-five.</p>

<p>Only the students of the first year are lodged in the building; and
owing to the unusually large number lately admitted, an adjoining house
has been taken to afford additional room. The accommodation in general
is rather limited. Two stories in the upper part of the building are
occupied by the somewhat scantily furnished
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page328" id = "page328">328</a></span>
chambers; there appeared in some cases to be two young men in one room,
in other cases four, or as many as six or seven to a bedroom and
sitting-room. The students who lodge in the building dine together in a
mess-room; and there is a billiard-room, with coffee-rooms adjoining it,
for the general use, looking out from the ground floor front into the
Unter den Linden. There is a library, a small laboratory attached to the
lecture-room employed for the subjects of Chemistry and Natural
Philosophy, and a small collection of apparatus required for
illustration on the latter subject.</p>

<p>On quitting the school, the engineer students, as soon as they obtain
their commissions, are employed for three years with a Division of
Engineers; then for three years in a fortress to superintend buildings;
and then again with a Division of Engineers. They are then eligible to
promotion as first-lieutenants.</p>

<p>The artillery students, in like manner, join and serve with their
regiments.</p>

<p>Promotion in the artillery is by regiments, in the engineers it is
general throughout the whole corps.</p>

<p>We should not omit to call attention to the fact, that the only
instance which has come to our knowledge of the promotion of <i>officers
in their own arm of the service</i>, being made contingent on their
passing an examination, is to be found in the Prussian Artillery and
Engineers. First-Lieutenants belonging to those corps must pass an
examination before they can be promoted to the rank of captain. This
regulation does not exist for any other part of the Prussian service,
and it is considered a great grievance by the officers of those corps,
as it may be exacted at the age of forty, from the most highly educated
officers of the Prussian army.</p>

<p>The pay of subaltern of engineers is somewhat higher than that of the
artillery, infantry, and cavalry. Above the rank of subaltern, the pay
of the artillery, cavalry, and engineers, is on an equality, but
superior to that of the infantry. The engineers have, moreover, a
prospect of employment of a civil nature when they return from active
service; to lucrative positions of this kind they are not unfrequently
appointed.</p>

<p>It should be mentioned before quitting the subject, that all the
officers of the artillery and engineers are bound, in consideration of
three years’ maintenance in the school, to serve a period of six years,
before they can exercise the usual privilege allowed to Prussian
officers of withdrawing from the service.</p>

<p>[<i>A particular account of the Course of Instruction in this School
will be given in a separate article under the title of the
Institution.</i>]</p>

SCHOOL FOR STAFF OFFICERS AT BERLIN.</a></h4>

<p>The War School (<i>Kriegs-Schule</i>) in Berlin has undergone many
changes since its foundation in the time of Frederick the Great. It is
now the Staff School of Prussia, <i>i.e.</i>, the only, or almost the
only, means of obtaining a staff appointment is by passing through it,
and the education given is particularly intended to form staff officers.
Its plan and methods of teaching differ, indeed, from the very
commencement from the French Staff School, and bear much more
resemblance to the senior department at Sandhurst, with the exception
that the senior department is not at present a necessary means towards a
staff appointment.</p>

<p>Thus the <i>Kriegs-Schule</i> does not take young men of twenty-one
or twenty-two and educate them (like the French Staff School) for the
staff and the staff alone. Its pupils are men of twenty-five or
twenty-six, officers of three years’ standing, or five years’ service
since their first entering the army. At this comparatively ripe age they
become candidates for entrance to the Staff School, and, if admitted,
they spend there three years of laborious study, with no very brilliant
prospects to crown it, as only a very small number obtain what may be
called the lowest prize, admission to the Topographical Department; and
out of these only two or three yearly of the most distinguished pupils
gain the Staff. The rest return to their regiments, and are employed as
adjutants or as teachers in the Division Schools.</p>

<p>The process of entrance is as follows:&mdash;An officer of three
years’ standing desires to go to the Staff School. Any one may send in
his name as a candidate for the entrance examination to the minister of
war, having obtained a certificate from his superior officer that he
understands his regular duty, has no debts, and is capable, both as
regards his abilities and bodily strength, of making a good staff
officer. Little difficulty is made about admission to become a
candidate, nor is there any regulation to limit the number from any one
corps or regiment, so that there may be often found in the Staff School
more in proportion from the infantry than the cavalry, and <i>vice
versâ</i>. Some regiments, we heard, hardly ever send officers to the
school. Practically, indeed, the regulation requiring three years of
active service bears hard upon the artillery and engineers in comparison
with the other services; for, as the officers of these two corps only
enter their own school after they have been near a year in the service,
and spend three years there, they must have been in the army nearly
seven years before they can enter the Staff School.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page330" id = "page330">330</a></span>
<p>The candidate for the Staff School is examined in the capital of the
province in which his corps is stationed. The examination is early in
April, and it is held at the provincial town instead of Berlin, in order
to diminish expense. But the questions are sent from the board of
examiners in Berlin, and the same are given in the different provincial
towns at one and the same time. The examination is much on the same
subjects, and requires about the same actual knowledge as that which was
passed at least three years before for a lieutenancy, but owing to the
difference of age, the questions are put and are expected to be answered
in a much more scientific form than on the first occasion. Thus, we were
told, such an essay as “Give an account of the wars of Francis I. and
Charles V.,” would at the <i>Kriegs-Schule</i> Examination rather be
stated thus: “What was the influence of these wars on the policy and
religion of Europe?”</p>

<p>The examination is entirely upon paper; it occupies from ten to
twelve days of about five hours daily, the superintending staff officer
in the province presiding over it. But his business is limited to
reading out the questions sent to him, and taking care that no books are
brought in, or any improper means used. The answers to the questions
have to go through a double ordeal, the military ones being first
examined by some of the staff of the general commanding in the province,
and afterwards by the commission of examiners at Berlin. The final
decision rests with the chief of the Prussian staff, who recommends the
successful officers to the minister of war.</p>

<p>There is an average of sixty or seventy candidates yearly. Only forty
of these can be taken. If some additional case seems meritorious, the
officer may obtain a promise of appointment, but his entrance is
deferred. It is not uncommon to try more than once.</p>

<p>The entrance examination passed, the school opens on the 1st of
October, to continue its lectures, with a fortnight’s break at Christmas
and at Easter, till the first of June. It has its 120 pupils, divided
into their three classes, one for each year, working (with only little
of practical work) under professors, military for the lectures of a
military, and civil for those of a non-military character. No
difficulty, we understood, is found here, as we had heard to be the case
at St. Cyr, in enforcing the fullest attention to the lectures of the
civilian professors; each is respected according to his knowledge of the
subject, and it would be thought as absurd for a military professor to
undertake a non-professional subject, as <i>vice versâ</i>.</p>

<p>The method of working is that so commonly followed in the
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page331" id = "page331">331</a></span>
Prussian universities of listening to numerous lectures, and taking
copious notes upon them. Nearly five hours daily, from eight in the
morning till one, are often continuously occupied in this manner; for
although only twenty hours of attendance are absolutely exacted weekly
(an&nbsp;amount which to our own students would seem more than ample)
ten more are said to be necessary to enable an officer to do any justice
to the various subjects of which he is expected to show some knowledge
at his examinations.</p>

<p>These lectures are usually read aloud; there is no questioning and
answering. The student, after five morning hours, must spend at least
five or six more in copying them out, or in writing an essay on the
subject of some of the lectures. Of these one is given about every three
weeks, but only on military subjects. They are carefully corrected and
sent back to the student with the notes of his teacher, and their merit
influences the final estimate of his whole work.</p>

<p>Besides this daily work, the examinations are at once a stimulus and
a means of testing proficiency. These occur every three months, but the
yearly ones are the most important. They are entirely upon paper. In the
quarterly ones the papers are only given for two hours at a time daily,
and take the place of two common lectures; in the other examinations
they are daily for four or five hours. They are entirely essays upon the
numerous subjects lectured on in the school, History of War, Philosophy,
Tactics, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Perhaps there is no better way of giving an idea of the mode of
studying than by a statement of some of the subjects of these essays.
They have been supplied to us by the kindness of Lieutenant Berger, of
the 28th Infantry, from whom we have received much valuable information
on the subject.</p>

the Lectures given above. Besides military <ins class = "correction"
title = "text has ‘jects’ (only) after line break">subjects</ins>, it
includes a very full course of Ancient and Modern History, an addition
to the History of War (which last alone occupies seven hours weekly for
the last year,) a good deal of Logic and Philosophy of Art and
Literature, and of Political Economy. Some of these lectures have
probably been introduced from the school, having a double object, that
of giving a diplomatic as well as a military education. This was the
original idea of Frederick the Great, who, in all his plans of military
teaching, laid a great stress on the general literature which he himself
valued so highly. This diffusive study is a strong contrast to the
principle of “little, but well,” and to the constant practical exercises
in the laboratories insisted on by the early teachers of the Polytechnic
School in France.</p>

<p>It will be seen that the above course is entirely theoretical; no
practical work (as&nbsp;in France) relieves the sedentary labor of ten
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page334" id = "page334">334</a></span>
hours daily for more than eight months of the year. But as soon as the
first year’s course is ended, all the officers who are supposed to know
drawing before coming to the school, are sent into the country for three
weeks to practice military drawing and surveying; and those of the third
year go through (also for the same period) a similar course of staff
duty. These last are sent under the direction of the officer who is
Professor of Staff Duty at the School; each student officer gets his
separate orders, and they meet and are told off every morning for their
day’s work, reconnoitering fortresses, surveying the frontiers between
Austria and Prussia, &amp;c., &amp;c. During the remaining three summer
months the students are sent in successive classes to those arms of the
service which are not their own, and after the usual military exercises
are completed they must bring back with them a certificate of
proficiency from the commanding officer. This amount of time was spoken
of as being too little.</p>

<p>If we are surprised at not finding a greater amount of practical work
included amongst the labors of the school, we must remember that it is
chiefly postponed to a later period of the officer’s career, when the
probability of his being required to use it on the staff is greater.
This is when he has gained his place in the Topographical Department,
and is working there upon trial to test his fitness for the actual
staff. He is then employed during winter in working on the Theory of
War, and during summer in military surveying and drawing.</p>

<p>Such is the method and extent of the officer’s work at the Staff
School; a few more words are needed on the character of his
examinations, which here as everywhere else must greatly influence the
character of the work.</p>

<p>There are no less than nine examinations during the three years, one
for every three months, but the final one at the end of each year is the
more important, as a sort of summing up of the year’s work. In marking
for this the merit of the essays done at home is taken into account. The
result in each branch of work and on every examination is entered by the
several professors in a book kept at the directory, and the pupils have
a right to inspect the report of their own work. The net result of his
own three years’ work is also sent to the officer after leaving the
school through the authorities of his regiment. The certificate of this
contains the criticism on each branch of his work in detail.</p>

<p>The subjects given for essays will show the nature of the chief
examinations (<i>i.e.</i> those at the end of each year;) four or five
hours
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page335" id = "page335">335</a></span>
is the time generally allowed to a difficult subject, the examination
stretching over a number of days, in proportion to the subjects taken
up. The pupil may bring in his notes of lectures, on which extraordinary
care is bestowed, and which must contain everything that can be said on
the subject. Much value is said to be attached to the rapidity with
which an essay is worked, as showing a quality valuable in an officer.
There is, as we have observed, no <i>vivâ voce</i> of any kind in this
School. Some competition exists in the Staff School, (and it is almost
the only Prussian school where we find&nbsp;it,) for the knowledge that
only eight or ten out of the forty pupils can obtain the Topographical
Department, and only two out of these eight or ten, the staff, acts as a
competitive stimulus. We must add, however, that although a minute
account of the <i>positive</i> merits of the pupils is drawn up and sent
to them at the end of their career, they have no means of ascertaining
their <i>relative</i> positions; and this may always leave room for
doubt, whether the places in the Typographical Department and on the
Staff are strictly given by merit, or whether patronage does not here
step in. Another ambiguity may be remarked in the fact that the relative
importance of the subjects of study is not known. It may of course be
surmised, that a knowledge of the Peloponnesian War is not marked so
highly as that of the Seven Years’ War; but any indefiniteness as to
what is or what is not important, will generally lead to an attempt to
know something <i>of all</i> the subjects mentioned, and it would
undoubtedly be better to affix its definite value to every subject. It
would prevent what seem to us valid objections to the present system of
the Staff School, the attempt to crowd in too many subjects, instead of
mastering thoroughly a few.</p>

<p>The final examination having been completed in June, the student goes
through the three weeks of staff duty we have described, and finishes
his last three summer months in that branch of the army in which he has
not yet served. He then returns to his regiment, where he receives the
certificate of his three years’ work. But no list is published of the
order of merit in which the officers stand. If the certificate is
satisfactory, he forwards it to the Chief of the Prussian Staff, with a
request to be employed in the Topographical Department of the Staff. If
this is granted, he receives an order to join it in about two years,
<i>i.e.</i> about nine or ten years after first entering the
service.</p>

<p>About eight officers are yearly sent to the Topographical Department,
and serve there for two or three years, surveying and drawing in summer,
working at military science in the winter. The
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page336" id = "page336">336</a></span>
correction of the Topographical Map of Prussia is in their hands.
Finally, two out of these are selected for the Staff; the remainder
return to their regiments, to become adjutants or to teach in the
Division Schools.</p>

<p>The most immediate advantage of being in the staff corps is promotion
to a captaincy at any age, which, considering the extreme slowness of
promotion in Prussia, may be termed an early one. This is generally
gained within two or three years after joining the corps, <i>i.e.</i> at
thirty-three or thirty-four. In other corps hardly any one has a chance
of becoming captain till after forty.</p>

<p>We may add, that the number of officers in the Topographical
Department is about forty, on the staff itself sixty-four. No one
belonging to the staff is below the rank of captain, or above that of
colonel. Every general of division has one officer of the staff attached
to him, and two adjutants, the first nominated by the chief of the
staff, the two last by the king, and these two belong rather to the
officer than to the general. They are not removable with him. The
adjutants are not officers of the staff, though they are often chosen
from amongst those who have been at the Staff School. They are nominated
by the king upon reports sent into him by the generals of division, and
the appointment is not considered a great prize, as it implies neither
extra pay, promotion, nor permanency; the adjutants are promoted in the
usual course, and then, upon promotion, return to their regiments. The
adjutants of battalions and regiments are appointed, like our own, by
the officers commanding. The name of aide-de-camp does not exist in the
Prussian service, but that of adjutant is used in its place.</p>

<p>There are three Military Orphan-Houses in Prussia for the children of
soldiers, two for boys, one at Potsdam, and the other at Annaburg, and
one for girls at Pretzch. Although intended for orphans, they receive
children whose parents are too poor to provide for them. They receive a
good elementary education and are brought up for trades, and can make
their selection between a civil and a military career. The English
Commissioners report that they found 800 pupils in the Orphan-House at
Potsdam, of whom 200 were under the charge of female teachers; 520 were
in the senior department, including thirty-six in the music class, who
will go into the Regimental Bands, and about twenty who formed a
separate military class, who would probably enter the Artillery
School.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page337" id = "page337">337</a></span>
<p>The School at Annaburg, and the subsidiary Girls’ School at Pretzsch,
are both Protestant in character; no religious teaching is supplied for
Roman Catholics. Roman Catholic boys are all sent to Potsdam, and Roman
Catholic girls are provided for in ordinary schools, and in private
families, and payment made on their behalf out of the funds of the
institution.</p>

<p>Dr. Bache in his “<i>Report on Education in Europe</i>,” gives the
following account of these institutions.</p>


<p class = "heading"><i>Military Orphan-House at Potsdam.</i></p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>This institution was founded in 1724, by Frederick William the First
of Prussia. The reputation of Franke’s Foundations induced this monarch
to rival the benevolence of the clergyman, and to establish on a scale
proportioned to his greater means, a house for the education of the
orphans of his soldiers. While, however, the recipients of Franke’s
bounty are free to choose their career in after life, and only so far
bound to the institution, as a sense of gratitude may prompt, the youth
who passes through the Military Orphan-house of Potsdam, must enter the
military service for twelve years. Three of these, indeed, are the term
of service of every citizen, and I believe the three years in the
non-commissioned officers’ school are now counted as part of the twelve,
and thus the actual number of extra years of service is reduced to six.
The institution began with one hundred and seventy-nine children, both
girls and boys being received; this arrangement continued until a few
years since, when the girls’ school was removed from Potsdam, and the
establishment at present is for male pupils only. There are between
three and four hundred in the elementary or boys’ department. In the
early history of the orphan-house two attempts are recorded to introduce
manual labor, as a profitable speculation; neither of which appears,
however, to have succeeded. The first of these, the manufacture of
Brabant lace, was introduced in 1743, and after various modifications of
the mode of applying the labor of the children, it was finally abandoned
in 1795. In 1744, the culture of silk was introduced extensively
throughout the kingdom, and especially enjoined at the orphan-houses;
but this attempt was not more successful in the end than the other, and
the culture is not kept up in this institution.</p>

<p>The present spacious buildings were chiefly constructed under the
reign of the founder and of Frederick the Great. Additions have,
however, been made from time to time since, and the whole plan is hardly
yet completed. The institution may be considered as divided into three
departments or schools; an elementary school, (called the Boys’ House,
<i>das Knabenhaus</i>,) a trade school, and a music school. The
buildings for the elementary school are erected about a spacious court,
which serves as an exercising and play-ground. On the ground floor are
the refectory, in which all the youth from the different schools
composing the institution, meet three times a day, and the study and
play-rooms, lavatory, &amp;c. The study-rooms form a long range, and
when the doors of communication are opened, one teacher can superintend
the whole of the classes. The school-rooms are on the first and second
floors, and are calculated for divisions of forty boys each. There are
six dormitories, furnished with wooden or iron bedsteads, the latter
having been more recently introduced and found to
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page338" id = "page338">338</a></span>
answer well. The bedding consists of a straw bed beneath, and a mattress
of hair above. Each dormitory is superintended by a teacher, who sleeps
at one end of it. There are also dwelling-rooms for the teachers,
officers, &amp;c., and in the court a very large wash-house, with a
drying-room above it.</p>

<p>The buildings occupied by the trade and music schools are separated
by a street from the others, and with the dwellings of the officers, a
room for gymnastic exercises, and musical practice, and the workshops,
form a second immense series of structures. The infirmary is near to
them, and is under a separate direction; subordinate, however, to the
general executive body. It is divided into rooms assigned to patients
suffering from different complaints. A&nbsp;schoolmaster gives
instruction to the convalescent. The arrangements in the dormitories of
the trades’ school, are similar to those used in the army, and the
Superintendence and discipline are strictly military.</p>

<p>The part of the building occupied by the music school, contains
separate rooms for practicing by individuals, class-rooms, and
dormitories. There are rooms in the main pile for the meetings of
teachers, for a small library, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The executive board of this school depends partly on the ministry of
war, and partly on that of public instruction; the former, however, is
the controlling authority. Under this board is the military
superintendent, or director, to whom the chaplain, the secretaries, the
economist, the military superintendent of the day, the teachers,
commandants of companies, the inspectors of the trades’ and music
school, and other officers, are directly responsible. The clergyman is
the superintendent of the elementary school, and has a general charge of
all the intellectual and religious instruction.</p>

<p>The orphan children of soldiers are received for maintenance, at any
age, by the authorities of the establishment, but if under six years,
are boarded with their friends or others until six, and then admitted
into the house at Potsdam; they remain there until fourteen or fifteen
years of age, and, if of sound constitution, are transferred to the
trade, or to the music school, where they remain four years, and whence
they pass, if their conduct has been good, to the school for
non-commissioned officers. I&nbsp;have never seen a body of young men
all so well physically developed as the pupils of the trade school, a
result produced by constant attention to their education on this point.
Children who are not healthy, or who have failed in the elementary
school, are apprenticed at fourteen, and the institution ceases to have
the charge of them.</p>

<p>In the <i>Elementary School</i>, the usual branches taught in the
common schools of Prussia are pursued, including reading, writing,
arithmetic, the German language, geography, drawing, religious
instruction, and a little natural history. The boys are divided into
four classes, according to their proficiency, and all the classes below
the first are subdivided into two sections, each being under the charge
of a teacher, and having a separate recitation room. These sections
contain about forty pupils each. A&nbsp;monitor of order from among the
pupils, has charge of a section on entering and leaving the school-room,
and render such service as the master requires during the lesson; he is
assisted by one of the class in the distribution of the books, slates,
and other implements of instruction. The teachers keep each a roll, upon
which the character of the recitation and conduct of the pupils is
entered, and which is examined weekly by the chaplain, and submitted to
the board of teachers at their meetings. No youth, who is below a
certain grade upon this roll, is permitted to enter the trades’ school.
There are about five hours of instruction on four days of the week, and
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page339" id = "page339">339</a></span>
about twenty-three in the whole week. The holidays are, a week at
Easter, four days at Michaelmas, a fortnight in the latter half of July,
and from the twenty-third of December, to the second of January. For
those who have no friends to go to, the Christmas festivities are kept
up in the school, as in the private families of the country.</p>

<p>The board of teachers meet once every fortnight, and the director, or
his substitute, or the chaplain, presides. At their meetings, all
matters relating to <ins class = "correction"
title = "text has ‘in-/instruction’ at line break">instruction</ins> and discipline are
discussed.</p>

<p>The form of the discipline of the school is military, but a spirit of
mildness tempers it, suiting it to the age of the pupils. The boys, in
general, are divided into four companies, each of which has a
commandant, (a&nbsp;non-commissioned officer of the highest grade,) who
has charge of the instruction in military exercises, and ranks with the
teachers of the school. These companies form a battalion, and are
drilled without arms, and inspected by the director, or an officer
appointed by him. In turn the commandants of companies, acting as
officers of the day, have general charge of the military and police
duties. Two of the teachers, also, in turn, act as inspectors of the
day, and have the general superintendence of the pupils in study and
recreation hours, in the duties of personal police, at meals, and in the
dormitories, relieving each other at different parts of the day. They
are co-ordinate in authority with the officer of the day, and he is
expected to relieve and aid them in the maintenance of order. These
officers report immediately to the director.</p>

<p>The four companies are subdivided into sections of eleven, over each
of which one of the boys is placed, with the title of overseer, or
corporal, and he is responsible for the good order of his section, and
may be assisted in his duties by one chosen from it. From among these
corporals one is selected for the general control and superintendence of
the others, and marches the company to the lavatory, to meals, to the
dormitory, &amp;c., being responsible for them whenever they are
collected as a company. The boys composing a section are placed at meals
upon the same side of the table with the corporal who has charge of
them. The younger pupils do not join these companies at once, but are
kept together in a division which is under female superintendence, has a
separate overseer, and is under different regulations as to rising,
going to bed, and other particulars of discipline and police from the
elder pupils.</p>

<p>All the duties of domestic and personal police, and some of those of
domestic economy, are performed by the boys enrolled in the four
companies. They clean their own shoes, brush their own clothes, attend
to the police of the different parts of the building, serve the meals,
and make their beds. That the various duties may be attended to in an
orderly way, there are, besides those already spoken of, special
overseers appointed among the pupils, who have general charge of them
while engaged in certain duties, and of particular localities. Thus
there is an overseer of the room where the clothes and shoes are kept,
who has charge of the exchange of the Sunday for week day dress, and
vice versa; an overseer of the room where the shoes are brushed and
blacked; an overseer of the lavatory; four superintendents of
cleanliness, who direct the pupils while washing and combing their hair;
one of hair cutting; two of serving the table, who have charge of a
detail of thirty pupils, who serve and clear the tables and clean the
knives and forks; one, of the manual labor classes; one, of the sick in
the hospital; one, of those who are unwell, and must report to the
physician; one, of the lights; one, to prevent the passing of bounds;
one
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page340" id = "page340">340</a></span>
the pupils who sing the liturgy in the church; one to conduct the
pupils, whose shoes require repairs, to the shoemaker; besides, those
for the classes and the younger boys, already mentioned, and a few
others. I&nbsp;make this enumeration in order to show the minuteness of
the arrangements for police and discipline, and the extent to which they
are conducted by the pupils themselves. The selections for appointments
are made by the teachers and officers, and submitted to the chaplain and
director for their approbation. A&nbsp;part of the pupils employed as
superintendents <ins class = "correction"
title = "text has ‘recieve’">receive</ins> small pecuniary allowances, and all enjoy many
privileges.</p>

<p>Some of the pupils, who are found to have a taste for music, receive
special lessons, and are employed, when sufficiently proficient, to give
the signals for the different duties of the day. Eight pupils are thus
selected to be taught the bugle and fife, and twelve the drum.</p>

<p>In regard to conduct, the pupils are divided into four grades,
according to the reports of the teachers and officers, a revision of the
classification taking place every quarter, and the director having, in
the meantime, the power to displace a pupil in a case of emergency. The
first class grade is composed of pupils distinguished for unvarying good
conduct, and on holidays its members are allowed to leave the
orphan-house alone to make small purchases at discretion, and are
neither subject to corporal punishment nor to the stoppage of their
meals. The second class is composed also of meritorious pupils, but of a
lower grade of conduct than the first; they are permitted to leave the
school sometimes, but not so often as the others, and are generally
under supervision. From these two grades only, the superintendents or
overseers are taken. Pupils of the third grade stand between those who
are decidedly good or bad, and are treated accordingly. They are the
last who are permitted to pass from the elementary to the trades’
school, on completing their course in the former. Those of the fourth,
or lowest grade, are kept constantly under supervision, have no
allowances, no leaves of absence, are separated, when possible, from the
rest of the pupils, and are even punished by an inferior diet.</p>

<p>The health of the pupils is promoted by frequent bodily exercise,
and, when the weather permits, in the open air. Thus they have regular
gymnastic exercises four times a week, are drilled by companies four
times, and by battalion twice a week, take frequent walks, and in
summer, bathe every day. The regular manual labor in this department of
the school is confined to knitting and tailoring. The gymnastic
exercises are conducted by two teachers, each taking charge of one of
the companies, of which two attend the lesson at the same time, and
assisted by pupils selected from among the most proficient in the
exercises. There are two swimming lessons given to each company, in
summer, every week. In the ordinary division of the day, in summer,
between two and three hours are allowed for manual labor, the same for
recreation, two hours for exercise, and nearly eight for sleep.</p>

<p>Their clothing is a neat uniform jacket of blue cloth, of a military
fashion, gray or white pantaloons for the winter, and a brown linen
jacket and white linen pantaloons for the summer, and their officers are
distinguished by badges similar to those worn in service. The diet is
generous, and, besides the three meals, bread is served as a luncheon in
the morning and afternoon intervals.</p>

<p>An opportunity is given to those who are to pass into the trades’
school, to ascertain the trade which they may wish to follow, by a trial
during the last year of the elementary course.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page341" id = "page341">341</a></span>
<p>The order of the day, with merely slight variations during four days
of the week, in summer, is as follows:&mdash;The pupils rise at a
quarter before five o’clock, and proceed by companies to the lavatory,
two companies occupying it at once and alternating, the other two being,
meanwhile, engaged in cleaning their shoes. Wash and comb their hair. At
half past five the boys detailed to serve the meals proceed to the
refectory under their two superintendents. At a quarter before six the
bugle sounds, and the companies assemble, by sections, in the
court-yard. Morning prayers and breakfast. Those who are slightly sick
report to the physician. At a quarter before seven, the boys assemble
according to classes, and at seven are marched to the school-rooms. At a
quarter before nine a luncheon of bread is served out to them. School
closes at eleven, and the pupils are free for three-quarters of an hour.
Dinner at about a quarter before twelve. The pupils brush their clothes,
and are inspected by the officer of the day. From a quarter past one to
half-past two, review the morning lessons in school. From a quarter to
three until five, are occupied with manual labor in the work-rooms. Part
of the pupils receive instruction in music, and the first and second
classes in drawing; a stated number take a swimming lesson; the
drummers, fifers, and buglers also have a lesson. A&nbsp;luncheon of
bread is distributed. One of the companies is at drill, one at
gymnastics, and the other pupils bathing or walking until seven. Evening
prayers in the refectory, and supper. Wash, and have recreation until
nine, when they retire. The younger pupils retire at half-past
eight.</p>

<p>In winter, the different occupations of the day are each one hour
later than in summer, until half-past two, when the hour of review of
the lessons is omitted, and the exercises, as far as appropriate to the
season, follow in the same order as in summer, until half-past five, at
which hour the pupils go to the school-room, and remain until a quarter
before seven.</p>

<p>On Wednesday and Saturday, an hour is devoted to religious
instruction, the other lessons being omitted, except the physical
exercises on Wednesday. Stated days and periods of the day are assigned
for the exchange of the weekday clothes for those of Sunday, for taking
clothes or shoes requiring repairs to the tailor or shoemaker of the
establishment, for hair-cutting and combing, for washing the neck and
shoulders, the feet, and for other minute matters.</p>

<p>The object of the <i>Trade School</i>, is, in part, to economize the
funds of the institution, by making within its walls articles of
clothing required for the pupils, but more to secure the acquisition,
not only of general mechanical dexterity, but of a trade, which may
serve to increase their emoluments when they enter the military service.
There are, at present, one hundred and four pupils.</p>

<p>In order to pass into the trades’ school from the elementary
division, the pupil must have reached at least the second class, have
been above the fourth grade in conduct, be between fourteen and fifteen
years of age, and of a bodily constitution fitting him for the military
service. The course lasts three years. The school has a special
inspector, or superintendent, who is responsible to the director of the
whole institution, or, in fact, to his substitute.</p>

<p>The different trades now taught here are those of blacksmiths,
saddlers, tailors, shoemakers, and lithographers. The last named has but
seven pupils admissible to its school, and the next to the last
forty-four. These numbers depend upon the demand for the occupation
subsequent to leaving the establishment, the space required for the
operations of the trade, the difficulty of teaching, &amp;c. As each
pupil is in general permitted, on advising with the inspector,
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page342" id = "page342">342</a></span>
to choose his employment, it sometimes happens that boys are sent into
the town to learn a trade not taught in the school. Changes of
occupation are very rare, but are sometimes permitted. The blacksmiths
are principally engaged in the repairs of arms, the saddlers make the
caps and accoutrements, &amp;c., used in the house, the tailors all the
uniforms, the shoemakers supply not only this orphan-house, but that of
the girls with shoes, and the lithographers are occupied in copying
forms for the school or war department, manuals, &amp;c. They work about
seven hours a day, under a master-workman from the town.</p>

<p>An hour of each day is spent in gymnastic or military exercises in
the open air in summer, and in winter in the large room before spoken
of. The military exercises, besides the ordinary ones, comprise some
which are peculiar to the Prussian service. The usual exercises of
gymnastics are introduced, omitting any which seem to have a tendency
towards the tricks of the mountebank. For instruction in these
exercises, the whole school is divided into two parts, and each again
into squads, so that the teacher need have but twelve to fourteen under
his charge. Non-commissioned officers are the under teachers, and in
turn are superintended by higher teachers, and by an inspector.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that to these well regulated and perseveringly
continued exercises it is, in great part, due that the physical
development of these youths is, on the average, so perfect. Judicious
recreation, a proper diet and clothing, great cleanliness, a proper
number of hours of work, of instruction and sleep, no doubt, are
necessary, each and all in their degree, but great influence must be
besides allowed to the gymnastic exercises.</p>

<p>The pupils have two hours of instruction during the day, intended to
keep up their knowledge of the branches taught in the elementary school,
rather than to teach new ones. Military drawing is, however, added.</p>

<p>When not in the shops, nor in school, nor at exercise, they are
superintended by non-commissioned officers. The discipline in this
school is military in spirit, as well as in details.</p>

<p>Those pupils who have manifested a decided musical talent in the
lower school, are here instructed thoroughly in the theory and practice
of music. The object is to supply musicians to the regimental bands.
These pupils have a separate superintendence from those of the other
schools, and different hours of exercise and duty. They keep up the
knowledge acquired in the elementary school, as is done in the trades’
school.</p>

</div>

<p>Dr. Bache makes the following remarks on the above plan:</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>I have allowed myself to present this extended programme, because it
conveys, in as brief a compass as possible, excellent ideas of the
succession of courses in an elementary school, and in a technical or
trade school, for such the higher school must be considered. It should
be remembered that the main purpose is the preparation of youth for the
military service, and hence that the wants of the service are especially
consulted. Another fact must be remembered, namely, that this is a
Lutheran school, and therefore the religious instruction is adapted to
the particular views of that church. The course of morals of the third
class, I&nbsp;must say, however, seems to me out of its place, for
although our duties to God and our neighbor are of course best learned
from his Word, yet their inculcation by precept and example can not
commence too early.</p>

<p>In the arithmetical course, the union of mental and written
arithmetic is absolutely essential. The gradation appears to me good,
and the application to questions of common life gives a zest to such
studies, attainable in no other way. The theory of arithmetical
processes, however, should accompany or follow more nearly their
practical acquisition. Indeed, if they are taught as they ought to be,
by induction, the theory goes with the practice.</p>

<p>If the youth at Annaburg take the same pleasure in the exercises of
song, from the elements to the completion of the musical course, as
those of the school<a class = "tag" name = "tag2_9" id = "tag2_9" href =
"#note2_9">9</a> actually superintended by the author of this project,
the success will be complete.</p>

<p>The connection of orthography and writing, especially if combined
with early reading, is natural.</p>

<p>The exercises of induction, which in the lower classes are well drawn
out, deviate from the appropriate track in the fourth class, and in the
geographical and historical courses do not return to it. The system in
both these branches is rather synthetical than inductive. There is a
great temptation to break away from this method, into that of giving
positive instruction, from the apparently greater rapidity of progress
of the pupil; some teachers have abandoned it altogether, as too slow,
though ultimately to their cost, as appeared to me in cases where I had
an opportunity of comparing the results.</p>

<p>The writing is preceded by an introductory course of drawing, which
might
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page345" id = "page345">345</a></span>
with excellent effect be so extended as to branch out into complete
courses of drawing and writing.</p>

<p>As this plan results from an extended experience, the number of hours
of instruction, per week, necessary to secure the results, is an
important datum, and as such I have retained it, whenever it was
inserted in the original programme.</p>

<h5><a name = "prussia_nco_school" id = "prussia_nco_school" href =
"#prussia_nco">II. THE SCHOOL DIVISION OR NON-COMMISSIONED OFFICERS’
SCHOOL.</a></h5>

<p>A military school of a somewhat peculiar character for training up
young men for the duties of non-commissioned or <i>under</i> officers
exist at Potsdam, and is known as the School Division.</p>

<p>The rules of the Prussian Military system, which require only three
years absolute service in the standing army in time of peace, evidently
entail a great practical difficulty in this respect. The soldiers, as a
rule, prefer to quit the service at the end of their three years’ time,
and require great inducements to persuade them to remain. As one
inducement, the state has declared that twelve years’ service gives a
non-commissioned officer a formal claim to civil employment; as, for
example, on the railways or in the custom-houses. Their pay also as
non-commissioned officers goes on increasing according to the length of
their service; and it was stated to be the usual practice not to advance
soldiers to be non-commissioned officers until they had signed an
undertaking to serve for a longer period than could be exacted of them
otherwise.</p>

<p>A further means of supplying the want has been sought, and appears to
have been found in the School Division. The circumstances of its origin
have placed this establishment in immediate connection with the Corps of
Guards, to which, in a military sense, they belong, at whose
head-quarters, the town of Potsdam, their buildings are situated, and
whose garrison duty in the town they occasionally undertake.</p>

<p>At its first commencement the pupils chiefly came in drafts from the
Military Orphan-Houses. But the applications from the country in general
have been so numerous that this practice has been, it is said,
abandoned, and a higher class of admissions has been attempted. The
Commander of the Battalion of <i>Landwehr</i> for the Circle
(<i>Kreis</i>) receives all applications in that Circle; he sees that
the candidate is examined on the spot, in reading, writing, and
cyphering; and forwards the name, height, age, and other particulars
(the <i>Nationale</i>) to the authorities. The decision is said to be
mostly made by the candidate’s height, and his medical certificate, and
to be rather a difficult matter. Only one-third of the applications are
successful. A&nbsp;new boy had just presented himself with
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page346" id = "page346">346</a></span>
his father at the time of our visit; both son and father were well
dressed, and apparently belonged to the middle rather than the lower
classes. There seems every reason to be satisfied with the amount of
acceptance with the country which the school had begun to receive.</p>

<p>The age of admission is from seventeen to twenty, and the youth on
entering the school takes a military engagement to give two years of
service in the standing army for each year of his maintenance at the
school, in addition of course to those three years of military service
to which every Prussian is bound, but with the privilege of counting as
military service the period spent at the school.</p>

<p>The usual school course is one of three years, and his engagement is
thus for a term of nine years; that is, deducting three spent at the
school, six years’ time with the troops.</p>

<p>The School Division is 496 strong; there are four companies of 124
men. The whole body is commanded by a captain, or major, who has an
adjutant. To each company are attached four officers and fourteen
non-commissioned officers; the latter teach in the two first years, the
former in the third. The school course begins on the 1st of October; the
afternoons of three days in each week are employed in ordinary school
instruction, but the remainder of their time in winter and their whole
time in summer is devoted to military training. The school instruction
is not carried beyond reading, writing, and arithmetic up to the rule of
three; geography, drawing skeleton maps, and copying, and learning the
significance of military representations of ground. Some very
respectable specimens of their skill in copying maps were produced; it
appeared to be a favorite exercise.</p>

<p>About 150 are admitted yearly, an extra number being taken to supply
possible vacancies; about 130 yearly are drafted into the army, six
usually as <i>under</i> officers at once, forty at least with
certificates of being qualified to receive the grade in a short time;
and the whole number who go out have generally obtained their
appointment before twelve months are completed. The highest number that
may go out at once as under (or&nbsp;non-commissioned) officers is
twelve; three for each company. Many, however, have latterly, it is
said, become so within six weeks after their leaving.</p>

<p>Where the young men are strong and full-grown, they are allowed to
join the army at the end of two years; their whole service (two years
for each at the school) being therefore reduced to six years.</p>

<p>Young men, on the other hand, who show no disposition or likelihood
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page347" id = "page347">347</a></span>
to turn out good <i>under</i> officers, are sent off to complete the
usual time as privates.</p>

<p>The proportion of non-commissioned officers in the standing army who
are taken from the School Division was not easy to ascertain. It differs
extremely in different regiments. In one, it was stated that out of the
ordinary complement of 180, fifty came from hence. On the other hand, it
was asserted that the general proportion was not more than one in forty.
A&nbsp;certain number have obtained commissions; but no prospect of such
promotion appears to be held out, and any tendency to carry forward the
studies with a view to it is discouraged and checked.</p>

<p>The buildings, in the outskirts of Potsdam, are large, new, and
handsome, forming three sides of a spacious court or imperfect
quadrangle. The dining-rooms are used also as exercise-rooms, and it was
made a point to let us see a portion of the pupils go through their
gymnastics and exercises; and more particularly their sword and bayonet
exercise. Twenty or thirty young men, very healthy and strong-looking,
went through the latter exercise in two lines; after which came a single
combat with the bayonet, all under the direction of an officer.</p>

<p>The sleeping-rooms are fairly large, and well ventilated, on the same
floor. Twelve slept in each. During the day the wooden bedsteads are
placed one above another. It was said that iron bedsteads are being
generally introduced. Each young soldier is provided with a small
cupboard above his bed. The non-commissioned officers had horsehair, the
young men themselves straw paillasses. There was a stove in the room,
but it was said not to be used.</p>

<p>The school-rooms are on the upper floor. The skeleton maps already
referred to were here produced; one, of the two hemispheres, others
illustrating Prussian history, showing the original size of the Prussian
territory, its extent and condition under Frederick the Great, the whole
course of its gradual extention, &amp;c., very fairly drawn, and
creditable to the young men.</p>

<p>The time devoted to the training which is given in the School
Division appears long. What is now done in three years might as well be
done in half that time. The object, however, is secured of retaining the
service of the men during a lengthened period in the standing army.</p>

the Emperor Joseph I. while Silesia was yet an Austrian dependency, and
specially intended for young men of good birth in that country. There
are some military foundations in the school for the sons of officers of
good birth; and the two military men who take part in the instruction
are paid by the state, on the same footing as officers employed in the
State Military Schools.</p>

<p class = "break">[Of one of the Institutions above described (The
Artillery and Engineers’ School at Berlin) we shall give a fuller
account, and in the meantime we close this comprehensive survey of
military instruction in Prussia with the following reflections of the
English Commissioners.]</p>


<h4><a name = "prussia_general" id = "prussia_general" href =
"#prussia">VIII. GENERAL REMARKS ON THE SYSTEM OF MILITARY EDUCATION IN
PRUSSIA.</a></h4>

<p>1. Attention has often been drawn to the peculiar feature of Prussian
Military Education, the double examination for the rank of officer. The
principle adopted seems to be the exaction of a proof from <i>all</i>
officers that they have received a good, general, and professional
education, rather than the selection of a smaller number for higher
training in a military school. The decree of 1808 first laid down the
rule for the whole army, “that the only title to an officer’s commission
shall be, in a time of peace, education and professional
knowledge,&mdash;in time of war, distinguished valor and ability.”</p>

<p>2. The spirit of emulation is not so much called out in Prussia as it
is in France. Early distinctions are acknowledged and appealed to, but
somewhat sparingly. The following words express the view taken on this
point:&mdash;</p>

<p>“A testimonial of fitness for the University,” says Colonel von
Holleben, (<i>i.e.</i>, to have passed the Abiturient examination)
“dispenses with the examination for the ensigncy. In consequence of this
rule fifty <i>Abiturients</i> on an average annually enter the army.
These, as well as the <i>Selectaner</i> of the Cadet Corps, must be
considered in point of scientific education, an excellent supply of
officers.”</p>

<p>3. It will be seen that in the above words there is no reference to
those rewards and advantages which are the stimulus of competition.
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page349" id = "page349">349</a></span>
There appears some want in this respect both in the earlier and later
training of officers. Thus, in the instance of the Cadet House, there
are numerous <i>free places</i>, but these are assigned to young men,
not from any proof of merit or exertion, but entirely because they are
the sons of officers or state servants. The most distinguished pupils,
the <i>Selectaner</i> gain nothing more than to be permitted to pass
these two examinations before, instead of after, entering the army.
Honorable mention, is, however, made of the candidates for commission
who distinguish themselves in the Division Schools. But in the Staff
School&mdash;the natural resource of energetic young officers&mdash;the
competition (which the school asserts as its principle by its entrance
examination) loses some of its force, by the order of the pupils on
leaving the school not being distinctly marked. It should be mentioned
as an explanation of these facts, that in the general civil education of
Prussia, competition is little encouraged, less than in our own, and far
less than in the French, or even in the Austrian education.</p>

<p>4. The military system of Prussia, and in some degree its military
education also, appear to have various objects in view. Thus the Cadet
Houses, where the free places are chiefly given to the sons of military
men, seem intended to keep up a military <i>esprit de corps</i>, and it
is impossible not to be struck by the strong class spirit prevailing in
the Prussian army. At the same time means are taken, as above stated, to
obtain a good supply of highly educated officers.</p>

<p>5. Prussian military education seems to have been constantly
correcting and extending itself. Of this the Division Schools are a
striking example; and they deserve attention, both because their plan is
peculiar to Prussia, and for the improvements they have received. The
Prussians at first established numerous Division Schools, but they
afterwards greatly diminished their number; and the general inspector of
military education now contemplates, both for the sake of the
instructors and their pupils, a further reduction to three or four.
A&nbsp;large military school in three or four towns in Prussia, intended
to teach professional knowledge to young officers after some short
practical experience in the army, is thought a better mode of giving
such knowledge than to place isolated, or few teachers, in regiments or
army divisions.</p>

<p>6. One chief means of improvement has been the bringing the whole
education under a single head. At first there were distinct boards for
the examinations in Prussia, and for the schools, with a view to
maintain the independence of each. It was found, however,
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page350" id = "page350">350</a></span>
that this led to a want of harmony between the schools and the
examinations; and accordingly, whilst the board of examiners and the
school professors are kept perfectly distinct, they are both subjected
to the general inspector, who controls all the departments of military
education. The effect of this has been to give more unity to all the
teaching; an essential point where that teaching is entirely on the same
subjects. By constant inspection of the schools, and the receipt of
periodical reports from them, the general inspector of military
education is able to compare the results of each, and to keep the whole
system going at an even rate of progress.</p>

<p>7. Attention should be drawn to the somewhat complicated system for
working the Military Schools in Prussia. There are two distinct boards,
as we have noticed above, the supreme board of studies and the
examinations board, one of which reports to the inspector-general on all
examinations, whilst the other acts as his assessors and advisers with
regard to the schools and on all other subjects of military education.
Besides these bodies, each school has its own board of studies, which is
generally formed by some one person belonging to the school, combined
with distinguished officers or professors. Suggestions with regard to
each school appear to originate chiefly from these latter bodies.</p>

<p>8. The department of military examinations and education is under the
control of the general inspector, who “lays his proposals on matters of
administration before the minister of war, but reports directly to the
king in all matters relating to instruction and examinations.”</p>

<p><span class = "firstword">The</span> object of the <span class =
"smallcaps">Artillery and Engineer School</span> is to give to such
young men of the Artillery and Engineers as have been found fitted for
promotion, the education necessary for the proper performance of the
duties of a Subaltern Officer, and to enable them to draw profit
afterwards from their private studies and the practice of the
service.</p>

<p>The complete course of study lasts two years and three quarters. The
instruction is divided into three courses, bearing the name of
<i>cœtus</i>; on joining the institution, the young men enter the first
cœtus. Before the commencement of the studies, that is, about the 1st of
October, the General Inspectors of the two corps direct the young men
who are to enter the school to come up from their regiments and
divisions. They receive their pay and clothing from their regiments
until they are promoted to the rank of Officer.</p>

<p>The first nine months of each year of study are principally devoted
to theoretical instruction, the three last exclusively to practice. In
the third cœtus, the course finishes with the theoretical instruction on
the 1st of July.</p>

<p>The instruction of the first cœtus is directed to prepare the
students for the ordinary Officers’ Examination, and at the same time to
enable them to follow with advantage the further studies of the school.
The instruction, during the first year, is common to all the students.
Those who pass the Officers’ Examination enter at the commencement of
the second year into the second cœtus.</p>

<p>In the second cœtus the greater portion of the instruction, but not
the whole, is common to the two arms. In the third cœtus an almost
entire separation of studies takes place.</p>

<p>In all the studies which are common to the two arms, if the number of
students is too great for a single class, parallel classes are
established.</p>

<p>The <i>Curatorium</i> of the School is composed of the General
Inspectors of the two corps. To it belongs the authority of issuing
orders and regulations; no important change in these can be made without
its sanction.</p>

<p>The General Inspector of Military Instruction receives yearly at
fixed periods, reports upon the state and progress of the school.</p>

<p>The accounts are under the control of the War Department, with which
the Director of the School is in immediate communication. Questions of
principle and unforeseen cases of importance are decided by the
<i>Curatorium</i>.</p>

<p>The Inspector of the School, who is an Engineer Officer when the
Director is an Artillery Officer, and <i>vice versâ</i>, has the
immediate oversight of it. It is his duty to see that the orders and
regulations are strictly followed.</p>


<h5 class = "fullsize"><a name = "prussia_berlin_exec" id =
"prussia_berlin_exec" href = "#prussia_berlin_staff"><i>B.&mdash;The
Executive Authorities.</i></a></h5>

<p>The Director is appointed by the King. He is a Field Officer of
either Artillery or Engineers, and has the rank of Commandant of a
regiment. He has as assistant, a Captain appointed by the
<i>Curatorium</i>. The Director is immediately responsible for the
discipline and the finance of the establishment, and conducts its
ordinary details, assisted by the Captain. He is also President of the
Board of Studies; as such he exercises a general control over the
instruction, and regulates the ordinary examinations.</p>

<p>Under the Director and the Board of Studies are four officers, three
taken from the Artillery and one from the Engineers. They have the
immediate charge of the students, and are themselves under the direct
orders of the Captain.</p>

<p>The duties of Paymaster, Librarian, &amp;c., are divided among them.
They must also give at least two hours of instruction weekly to the
pupils.</p>

<p>The Board of Studies consists of the Director of the Institution as
President, and usually of the Senior Master of Mathematics, and the
Instructors of Artillery and Engineering in the third cœtus. In equal
numbers are likewise added Superior Officers of the Artillery and
Engineers appointed by the <i>Curatorium</i>. The duty of the Board is
to control the whole of the instruction, and to give an opinion when
required, upon the performance and capacities of the teachers and
students.</p>

Teachers.</i></a></h5>

<p>The teachers are to be selected as much as possible from among the
Officers of Artillery and Engineers. Where this can not be effected,
civilians of proved ability and experience are to be appointed.</p>

<p>The number of teachers is to be arranged with reference to the amount
and extent of the studies, in such a manner that in the event of illness
among them, no interruption in the instruction may arise. In addition to
the teachers, there is a certain number of assistant-teachers, partly
civilians, partly taken from among the fireworkers of the Artillery. The
latter are employed under the Librarian, and in the practical
instruction; they may also, in case of necessity, assist as clerks.</p>


<p class = "smallhead">THE STUDENTS.</p>

<p>The maximum number of students who enter each year is 80; 60 from the
Artillery, and 20 from the Engineers. In addition, a few young men may
be received from the smaller German States. In the event of the number
from one corps being short, an increased number may be admitted from the
other.</p>

<p>The number in the second cœtus is variable. It consists, first, of
the students previously in the first cœtus who have passed the Officers’
Examination; and, secondly, of such young officers as are appointed to
the Institution by the General Inspectors.</p>

<p>The students of the first cœtus lodge, as far as room will admit, in
the school buildings; the remainder, as well as the ensigns of the
second cœtus, not yet promoted to officers, are quartered in a
neighboring building. At least two of the direction officers lodge in
the school buildings; a third lodges in the other.</p>

<p>The Director may grant permission to a student, as a matter of favor,
to lodge with his parents.</p>

<p>The students quartered in the school and the neighboring building
dine together in the mess-room of the school.</p>

<p>The officers (students) of the second and third cœtus live in
lodgings in the town, and mess where they choose.</p>


<p class = "smallhead">ENTRY INTO THE SCHOOL, AND PASSAGE THROUGH
IT.</p>

<p>The entry into the first cœtus of the institution is conditional on
the applicant having passed, in the manner officially prescribed, the
examination for ensign. The necessary certificates are forwarded to the
Director of the School.</p>

<p>The instruction in the first cœtus embraces in general the subjects
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page354" id = "page354">354</a></span>
required for the ordinary Officers’ Examination, that is to say, the
elements of Military Science, so far as every Subaltern Officer is
obliged to know them. To this is to be added instruction in mathematics,
in French, and in free sketching.</p>

<p>At the commencement of the instruction the teachers inspect the whole
of the Ensign-Examination papers of the newly-arrived students, which
are laid before them by the Director, in order the better to judge of
their acquirements. During the first quarter they take pains to
ascertain the ability as well as the amount of acquirements of each
student, so as to be able to give a confident opinion upon him at the
end of the quarter.</p>

<p>After the close of the first quarter a conference of the teachers,
under the presidence of the Director, takes place, to form a report upon
the students, and to furnish data for recommendations to the rank of
ensign of such students as have given satisfaction by their conduct and
progress. The students about whom the teachers have not yet been able to
speak confidently, who, in certain studies, as in mathematics and the
special branches of their arm, are behind-hand, as well as those whose
conduct has not been without blame, are proposed to the higher
authorities for permission to continue to remain at the school. On the
other hand, the Board of Studies proposes for dismissal from the
institution, students whose conduct has been unsatisfactory, and
principally who give too little hope of a favorable career. The Board is
to express an opinion whether any prospect may be held out of a future
recall to the institution, according as its unfavorable report has been
founded on the want of ability or on the want of industry of the
student.</p>

<p>The students favorably reported on are immediately, by the General
Inspectors, appointed ensigns, subject to vacancies. The
<i>Curatorium</i> decides regarding the further stay at the institution,
or the dismissal of the others.</p>

<p>After the end of the second quarter, those pupils who can not yet be
recommended for promotion to ensign are only in special cases allowed to
remain till the end of the theoretical instruction of this year; if they
can not then be recommended, they are sent back to their regiments.</p>

<p>Fourteen days before the close of the theoretical instruction for the
year, that is to say, about the middle of June, the teachers give an
opinion regarding each student of the first cœtus, as to whether or not
they consider him capable of undergoing the Officers’ Examination, and
to pass into the second cœtus. These reports, joined to that of the
Director, as regards the conduct of the students,
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page355" id = "page355">355</a></span>
enable the Board of Studies to propose to the higher authorities either
that permission may be granted to undergo the Officers’ Examination,
(and, if successful, to enter the second cœtus,) or that the student be
sent back to his corps. Students who have been refused permission on
grounds not altogether unpardonable, from presenting themselves for the
Officers’ Examination, or who in the course of instruction have been
sent for any reason to their corps, with the prospect of being
afterwards called back to the school, may, on the proposition of the
Board of Studies, through the <i>Curatorium</i>, be granted a second and
final entrance into the first cœtus.</p>

<p>The <i>Curatorium</i> decides in every case whether a student who has
not qualified himself for entry into the second cœtus, may return to the
first cœtus after having left the institution, or in case he shall have
in the meantime passed the Officers’ Examination, whether he may, as an
exceptional case, enter the second cœtus. In a case of the latter kind,
the applicant can not present himself for the Officers’ Examination
without having previously passed a preliminary examination at the
school, to do which, the permission of the General Inspector of his
corps is necessary.</p>

<p>The theoretical course closes at the end of June. During the month of
July the students of the first cœtus are employed in surveying
operations. It is during this month that the examination for the rank of
officer before the General Examining Board takes place. The students who
pass this examination enter afterwards into the second cœtus; those who
fail are, at the expiration of the practical course of their year, sent
back to their corps.</p>

<p>The students who pass the Officers’ Examination, and are found
qualified to enter the second cœtus, are then proposed for election to
the officers of their corps. If the decision be favorable, their names
are submitted by the General Inspectors to the King, to be appointed, on
vacancies occurring, to the rank of Supernumerary
(<i>Ausseretatsmässigen</i>) Second Lieutenant.</p>

<p>To assist the Officers of the Corps in making their election, an
extract of the reports above alluded to is sent to them, so far as it
concerns the students who have successfully passed their Officers’
Examination.</p>

<p>It is an indispensable condition for entering the second cœtus, that,
if a student of the first cœtus, he should have passed the Officers’
Examination, or if he should now enter the school for the first time,
that he should have the rank of Officer. The sum of acquirements
necessary for the Officers’ Examination forms the basis of the
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page356" id = "page356">356</a></span>
instruction given in the second cœtus. In it the instruction ceases to
be entirely common to the two arms.</p>

<p>At the end of the theoretical course of the second cœtus, a report of
progress and conduct is drawn up, as in the first cœtus, by the Board of
Studies, on the data furnished by the teachers as regards the studies,
and by the Director as concerns the conduct of the students. In
forwarding this report to the <i>Curatorium</i>, it is stated for each
student whether or not he is considered qualified to pass the <i>former
part</i> of the Special Corps Examination. Those who are unfavorably
spoken of in this respect return to their corps, if there are no
mitigating circumstances which permit a further stay in the second
cœtus, following the decision of the <i>Curatorium</i>. They may either
endeavor to obtain a transfer into another branch of the army, or by
study and good conduct prepare themselves for admission into the third
cœtus at a future period. But in this case they must not only be
recommended by their corps, but they must also pass the <i>former
part</i> of the Special Corps Examination.</p>

<p>The students recommended to present themselves for the <i>former
part</i> of the Special Corps Examination undergo it before a Board
appointed by the chiefs of the two corps in the beginning of July. It
extends over the subjects of professional science which have been taught
in the second cœtus. A&nbsp;particular regulation defines the mode of
this examination, which is entirely written; it decides whether the
student shall enter or not into the third cœtus.</p>

<p>The successful students pass, by direction of the <i>Curatorium</i>,
into the third cœtus, while the unsuccessful ones, as well as those who
have been reported unfit to undergo the examination, return to their
corps. By good conduct and study they may obtain permission to come up
again at the next examination for the <i>former part</i> of the Special
Examination. Their definite return to the school depends upon their
passing this examination, and upon the express order of the
<i>Curatorium</i>.</p>

<p>The instruction in the third cœtus is chiefly directed to supply the
special scientific knowledge required by each of the two arms. The
students of the two corps, therefore, receive separate instruction. A
further object of the instruction is to enable the students to make use
of the knowledge which they have acquired, on which account instruction
and practical application go hand in hand. Practice and theory go thus
together in this the highest portion of the instruction, so that they
both terminate at the same time, namely, at the end of the month of
June.</p>


<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page357" id = "page357">357</a></span>
<p>Previous to leaving the School, the <i>latter part</i> of the Special
Corps Examination is undergone before the same Board as for the
<i>former part</i>. This examination tests their qualifications in their
special arm, and proves their fitness for Artillery or Engineer
Officers. The results of this part of the examination and of the former
part of it passed at the close of the second cœtus, are combined by the
Board, and forwarded to the <i>Curatorium</i>. Along with these reports
is submitted a proposition for those who have passed the examinations to
be admitted into their corps. In the preparation of patents (for
commissions) they are antedated to the time of passing the Officers’
Examinations, proper regard being had to the results of the Special
Corps Examination for arranging the officers among each other.</p>

<p>Any officer who does not pass the Special Corps Examination, remains
with the pay of an infantry officer in his corps until he either enters
into another arm, or having obtained permission to re-enter the third
cœtus, he qualifies himself for the final examination. A successful
passing of the Special Corps Examination at this second trial can give,
under the most favorable circumstances, no higher seniority than that of
immediately after the officers who have passed their examination the
previous year.</p>

theoretical Part.</i></a></h5>

<p>The theoretical studies commence each year on the 1st of October, and
end on the 30th of June. They may be reckoned, after deducting the
vacation and holidays, to include a period of thirty-five weeks.</p>

<p>As a general rule, the studies take place only in the forenoon,
namely, during the five hours between eight and one o’clock.
Occasionally only are there hours of study for a small part of the
students in the afternoon. A&nbsp;portion of the afternoons, during the
theoretical course, are employed for drills and practice, but in no case
more than twice a week, in order that the students may have the
necessary time for recreation. The students are required (those who are
officers excepted) to remain in their quarters in the evening, to
prepare the work which has been allotted to them by the teachers.</p>

<p>The parallel classes of each cœtus, with the exception of the drawing
classes, are, as a general rule, to be under the same teacher.</p>

<p class = "smallhead">REMARKS.</p>

<p>In the first cœtus.&mdash;All the instruction in this class is common
to the two arms, and is equally divided among the six forenoons of the
week.</p>

<p>In the first and second cœtus.&mdash;With reference to the
mathematical instruction, it is particularly ordained, that each of the
two mathematical teachers shall give instruction to the same students in
the first and second cœtus, so that the one who teaches in the first
cœtus one year, teaches in the second cœtus the year following.</p>

<p>In the second cœtus:&mdash;</p>

<div class = "inlist">
<p>1. The larger portion of the instruction, as the table shows, is
common; in Plan Drawing the only difference is that the Engineers
receive two hours’ additional instruction.</p>

<p>2. The instruction in French, for a select number of the most
advanced students only, takes place on two afternoons.</p>

<p>3. The instruction in Free Sketching for the Engineers takes place
also on two afternoons.</p>
</div>

<p>In the third cœtus:&mdash;</p>

<div class = "inlist">
<p>1. About one-half only of the instruction in this class is common; in
Plan Drawing the Engineers have one hour more instruction a week.</p>

<p>2. The Chemical Manipulations (in which a very small number only of
the students share) take place on two afternoons.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page360" id = "page360">360</a></span>
<p>3. The instruction in French, in which only those already selected in
the second cœtus take part, also is given on two afternoons.</p>

<p>4. For mathematical instruction the class is formed into two
divisions. The first consists of those pupils who, in the opinion of the
teachers, are able to follow profitably the instruction in the higher
mathematics. The remainder form the second division, and go over a
second time what they have already learned, to which is added a variety
of questions in applied mathematics, important to the Artillery and the
Engineers.</p>

</div>


<p class = "smallhead">PRACTICAL EXERCISES.</p>

<p>These are carried on, as has been already remarked, in part during
the nine months of theoretical instruction, on some of the afternoons,
but they principally take place during the three summer months of July,
August, and September, in the forenoon. They commence early in the
morning, and often last till the afternoon, on which account there are
no evening hours of study during this period. As the students of the
third cœtus return to their corps at the beginning of July, those of the
first and second cœtus only take part in this practice. The visits to
the Fortress and Military Establishments of Spandau, and the preparation
of projects of military constructions, and of reconnaissances, must be
made during the period of theoretical instruction. It is therefore
suspended for one day for the students of the first cœtus, and for three
days for the Artillery, and five days for the Engineer students of the
third cœtus.</p>

<p>The distribution of time for each cœtus is as follows:</p>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;The employment of time in the last three months
above given, requires the whole of the months of July and August, and
about the first third of the month of September, after deducting
fourteen days for the Officers’ Examination for the first cœtus, and
occasional days lost through bad weather. The remaining two-thirds of
September are given for vacation, as well to afford recreation to the
teachers and students as to allow of the repairing and cleansing of the
school-buildings.</p>


<p class = "smallhead">MILITARY AND GYMNASTIC EXERCISES.</p>

<p>The month of October is appointed by the Director to the fitting and
making uniform the regimental clothing brought with the students
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page364" id = "page364">364</a></span>
from their corps. Military exercises then take place once a week for two
hours in the afternoon, till the 1st of April, or for about five
months.</p>

<p>The military exercises are carried on under officers of the garrison,
namely, a Captain and two Lieutenants of the Artillery of the Guard.
They put themselves in communication with the Director to arrange the
time, nature, and extent of the exercises.</p>

<p>The exercises consist of&mdash;</p>

<p>1. <i>Exercises on Foot.</i>&mdash;The whole of the first cœtus here
take part, but only so many of the second Cœtus as are required as
non-commissioned officers. Considering the composition of the squad,
(Artillery and Engineers,) and the object of the exercise, the
perfection of the students in company-drill is less to be attempted than
the endeavor to give to each a good position and carriage in the front
as well as in the ranks, and more particularly to accustom them to
military order and precision.</p>

<p>2. <i>Exercises with different descriptions of Guns in
Position.</i>&mdash;In preference, the light field-pieces of the year
1842 are to be used for drill, and correct, united and prompt execution
required. With the siege-guns, every student is instructed and practiced
with at least one calibre of each nature.</p>

<p>In addition to their military exercises, there are also&mdash;</p>

<p>3. <i>Fencing and Gymnastics.</i>&mdash;In these exercises the
students of the first cœtus only take part, and for two hours of the
afternoon each week, during the first six months. There is neither time
nor appliances to admit of the students arriving at a high state of
excellence. The practice in fencing is only intended to give confidence
in the use of arms, that in gymnastics to produce activity, and to
afford bodily exercise to young men much occupied in study.</p>


<p class = "smallhead">EXAMINATIONS AND CENSURES.</p>

<p>In addition to the several examinations already enumerated, by which
the fitness of the students for a certain rank or for promotion into a
higher cœtus is shown, some other examinations take place.</p>

<p>1. For the purpose of enabling the Director and the Board of Studies
to learn the progress of each separate student, and to confirm by their
own knowledge the opinion given by the teachers, there is twice in each
quarter an oral repetition of some portion of such instruction in the
first and second cœtus. The period of the examination is previously
named by the Director.</p>

<p>2. To give a general view of the progress of the entire year, and
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page365" id = "page365">365</a></span>
to incite the students to study, a public oral examination of those in
the first cœtus takes place at the close of the theoretical instruction,
in presence of the higher authorities of the school, superior officers
of the two arms, and other persons interested.</p>

<p>As a further incitement to the students, and as a warning to those
whose diligence or conduct has not been satisfactory, the quarterly
“censures” are read out to the assembled cœtus. In general the names of
the students are not mentioned, a number known to the individual only
being used instead. The best pupils are, however, openly commended by
name.</p>

<p>In the first cœtus, on the other hand, those pupils who have obtained
very bad “censure” are mentioned by name.</p>

<p>In the event of war, and if the instruction is suspended for an
indeterminate period, the salaries of the civil teachers cease.
Application is not to be made to the King for the grant of a provisional
indemnity, except under very peculiar circumstances.</p>

<p>The payment of the salaries and allowances is made monthly and in
advance.</p>

<p>The administration of the funds is directly under the supervision of
the Director. The Treasurer carries out the details. The superior orders
for the administration of royal grants are most strictly to be
followed.</p>

<p>The annual accounts are forwarded by the Director to the War
Department.</p>

<p>The property of the School consists of&mdash;</p>

<p>The Library, the Collection of Instruments and Models for Artillery
and Engineers, the Collection of Physical Instruments, the Collection of
Chemical Apparatus, and the School Utensils.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page366" id = "page366">366</a></span>
<p>The principal object of the Library is to serve as materials of
instruction for the teachers and students, and the Officers of Artillery
and Engineers present at the Institution. After that, as a center, for
the collection of all the best works, old and new, on Artillery and
Military Engineering.</p>

<p>The Director and Board of Studies take care that the instruments and
apparatus for the studies are always kept complete and in good order. As
the means of the school do not thoroughly admit of the collections
keeping pace with the progress of science, special care is taken that at
least the most necessary articles are not absent.</p>

<p>The utensils of the school are kept always complete, under the
supervision of the Director.</p>

<p>The property of the school is examined yearly by the Director and

<p><span class = "firstword">The</span> instruction must commence with
the first elements of the science, since the new arriving students have
little preparatory knowledge. It must be carried on to such an extent
that the pupil may be able, after going through the first cœtus, to pass
his <i>officer’s examination</i>, and after the completion of the entire
course, not only to show at his <i>special</i> examination that he
possesses the positive knowledge required for the ordinary duties of the
service, but also to prove that he is qualified for continuing his
studies by himself.</p>

<p>The Engineer pupils who close their instruction in artillery at the
end of the second cœtus, are to be instructed in the composition of
artillery, in the effect and the use of cannon, but more especially in
its employment in sieges.</p>

<p>From this general notice of the limits of the course it is evident
that neither a perfect exposition of the theory nor complete practical
exercises are expected. Still to train the students properly in the
different directions which an artillery education requires, the
instruction must not consist only in a theoretical lecture, but be aided
by judicious directions for drawing, and be perfected by practical
exercises. For the attainment of the two latter objects special
prescriptions are given, to which we refer.</p>

<p>Instruction in artillery is closely connected with the lectures on
mathematics, physics, chemistry, tactics, fortification, and veterinary
science.</p>

<p><i>a.</i> As special points may be mentioned, <i>in mathematics</i>,
calculation of contents, and fixing the centers of gravity, of cannon
and its parts; calculation of piles of shot; strength, direction, and
distribution of recoil on the separate portions of a piece of ordnance;
theory of machines, of carriages, of parabolic and projectile curves,
and calculation of the flight of rockets. In all these cases the
mathematical lecturer develops the necessary formulas for the artillery
student, but their application belongs to the course of artillery.</p>

<p><i>b.</i> <i>In physics.</i>&mdash;Explanation, notice, and
determination of the specific gravities of the materials used in
artillery. The law of gravity. The absolute and relative strength of
woods and metals. Friction. Resistance of the air. Expansive power of
gases, especially of those generated by gunpowder.</p>

<p><i>c.</i> <i>In chemistry.</i>&mdash;The general laws of chemical
action of bodies on one another. The simple elements of the materials
used in artillery. The chemical properties of their combinations. The
acids exhibited in the combustion of gunpowder and their action on
metals; the processes used in the reduction and manufacture of metals up
to the point where they are fit for use in artillery; chemical analysis
of gunpowder and of the most common metal-alloys. The action of the
atmosphere on substances exposed to it, which are used in artillery.</p>

<p><i>d.</i> <i>In tactics.</i>&mdash;The organization and tactics of
artillery, so far as they stand in direct relation to other arms.
A&nbsp;complete account of the conduct of artillery when coöperating
with other troops.</p>

<p><i>e.</i> <i>In fortification.</i>&mdash;Everything referring to the
tracing, the relief, and the
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page368" id = "page368">368</a></span>
construction of fortifications; attack and defense of field-works by
infantry and cavalry; complete exposition of the art of besieging, with
a discussion of all the duties of an engineer, a sapper or miner, both
in the attack and the defense of a fortress, also the use of infantry
and cavalry in sieges, with the omission of the points specially
belonging to artillery.</p>

<p><i>f.</i> <i>In the veterinary art.</i>&mdash;The anatomy and
physiology of the horse; general rules for feeding, treatment of
diseases, and disinfection of the stables and utensils.</p>

<p>The instruction in the first cœtus must, as already mentioned, be so
calculated, that the students at the end of the course of lessons may be
able to satisfy perfectly the requirements of the <i>Officer’s
examination</i>.</p>

<p>As a further prosecution of the same subjects of instruction in the
second, and again in the third cœtus, would lead to a great loss of time
and to tiresome repetitions, the lectures are to be so planned that the
separate subjects to be treated in the first and second cœtus, taken
together, are of sufficient extent for the Engineer pupils in general;
the further developments necessary for the Artillery pupils are reserved
in preference for the third cœtus.</p>

SECOND CŒTUS.</a></p>

<p>The instruction in the second cœtus is a continuation of the lectures
of the first cœtus, and embraces the use of artillery in the field and
in sieges. Its object is to bring the Artillery students to that point,
that they are able, at its close, to discharge satisfactorily the
ordinary practical duties of the service, and be prepared to follow the
course of the third cœtus, and to give to the Engineer students, who, in
the third cœtus no longer receive instruction in artillery, all the
knowledge of the subject required for their future profession. The
instruction must therefore be complete enough for the Engineers, and
give the Artilterist a solid and thorough preparation for the third
cœtus.</p>

<p>Instruction in the second cœtus should comprise, in
particular&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The organization of the artillery: purpose and considerations in
the putting together of all parts of artillery material, both in
tactical and administrative respects, with historical mention of the
diversities of practice of other Powers.</p>

<p>2. The use of artillery in the field. Marching and tactical
movements. Taking up position. The engagement itself, and conduct in
some particular cases; for example, in defile fighting, in
entrenchments, passage of rivers, &amp;c.</p>

<p>3. Use of artillery in sieges:&mdash;</p>

<p class = "heading">a. <i>For Attack.</i></p>

<p>Planning and throwing up the batteries. Preparation and use of the
different kinds of materials of construction. Different sorts of

<p class = "smallhead"><a name = "prussia_berlin_art3" id =
"prussia_berlin_art3" href = "#prussia_berlin_artillery">C. IN THE THIRD
CŒTUS.</a></p>

<p>In the artillery course of the first and second cœtus, the students
have gained a general knowledge of the materials of artillery, as well
as its organization and use as an Arm; but the lectures were for the
most part limited to what was of the greatest immediate consequence,
viz., the description of the actual condition and relations of the
Prussian artillery.</p>

<p>The object of the instruction given in the third cœtus is, on the one
hand, to expose the scientific laws of artillery and its various parts,
and, on the other, to track the historical development of the Arm, so as
by this means, and by consideration of the constitution of foreign
artilleries, to extend the views of the
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page370" id = "page370">370</a></span>
students beyond our own practice, thus, to form their judgment, and
induce them to think and contrive for themselves.</p>

<p>In the comparison of our own and foreign existing systems with the
results of scientific considerations, the teacher should proceed with
caution, and not raise in the young men the inclination to or the habit
of crude and officious criticism. Investigation of things as they exist
must, therefore, not confine itself to the mere search after defects; it
can be only profitable when employed to test our own powers at
improvements, and to discern thereby the difficulties and impediments
that accompany them. The value which speculative reasoning has for the
purposes of the artillery ought to be properly esteemed by the students,
but, in face of the results of experience, not be estimated too highly;
and in the comparison of different artilleries one with another, the
influence must not be overlooked which the peculiarities and the history
of a country ever exert on its institutions.</p>

<p>The final aim of the artillery instruction in the third cœtus must be
a higher degree of preparation for the future practical ability of the
students. As regards the material portion of the artillery, the students
are to acquire a general knowledge of the construction, fabrication, and
proving of the <i>matériel</i>, and for the tactical part, it is above
all things to be made an object that they be made capable, by the
instruction given them, of greater dexterity and confidence in dealing
with special cases in the field or in siege operations.</p>

<p>The instruction commences with:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Organization of the artillery service. The general relations of
the artillery service are to be explained according to its different
purposes, as an arm both in technical and administrative respects, then
the principles for the organization of the service and of its separate
portions in peace and war are to be developed, and comparison made with
those carried out in the principal foreign artilleries.</p>

<p>At the same time, on the one hand, more details are to be gone into
on the different branches of the artillery service (field, siege,
fortress, and coast artillery, the technical and the administrative
branches,) than was done in the second cœtus; and on the other, those
considerations must be kept sight of in which the artillery appears as a
portion of a greater whole, as in its relation to the Army and to the
State.</p>

<p>2. Artillery, regarded as an arm. Since the elementary rules for the
use of artillery in war have been given already in the second cœtus it
will be the object in the third cœtus, first, to develop the principles
of artillery tactics in the field, and in sieges, from an extended point
of view, and then to apply the rules for the movements, placing in
position and fighting of the artillery to the bodies now actually used
in war, and to examine the great questions that may hence arise. For the
field artillery, the tactics of single batteries and of masses of
artillery and the collective relations of the artillery of a <i>corps
d’armée</i> and of an army, must be shown. For sieges there will be less
occasion to treat of the separate means of defense by artillery than of
the various combinations under different circumstances, of its
diversified applications.</p>

<p>To give this instruction its most practical tendency, historical
examples of battles are to be taken, and not merely their results
adduced, but the circumstances gone through in detail. These are to be
compared with the rules previously given, and the causes and effects of
any discrepancies, as far as practicable, and with caution,
explained.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page371" id = "page371">371</a></span>
<p>Themes are then given out of campaigns and sieges, in working which
the students are to show applications of tactical rules under given
circumstances.</p>

<p>As regards the preparation for the field and the conduct in marches,
quarters, camps, or bivouacs, what was necessary has already been taught
in the second cœtus, as far as concerns a corps of artillery as large as
a battery. In the third cœtus, therefore, only more extensive and
important relations have to be explained.</p>

<p>Finally, as the students at the close of the third cœtus are to enter
immediately into active service in the regiments, it will be useful to
give them a general view of artillery duties in time of peace, of which
no mention was made in the first and second cœtus, and to show the
principles on which they rest. Further, the education of the men, the
selection, management, and care of the artillery horses, instruction in
riding and driving, the various exercises in serving and moving the
guns, artillery practice, the different fatigue duties, conduct in
manœuvres, detachments, &amp;c., are to be particularly explained.</p>

<p>3. Artillery in a technical and administrative point of view. In the
instruction given in the first and second cœtus, a descriptive notice
only was given, as regards artillery material, of the arrangement and
effect of what actually exists; and the reasons for this arrangement
were added only so far as was necessary for this principal object.</p>

<p>In the third cœtus the pupils are to learn by the inductive process
how, according to existing principles of natural science and of tactics,
with the known mathematical and technical aids, artillery material must
be contracted, manufactured, and proved, so as to obtain the desired end
in the highest degree; and then our existing material and that of other
countries are to be compared in the manner above stated with the results
thus obtained.</p>

<p>To this end, in the lectures, first, the necessary explanations of
artillery requirements are to be brought forward from the doctrine of
mechanics; after that the fabrication, proving, and action of gunpowder
are to be introduced; and finally, the construction, fabrication, and
examination of cannon, carriages, and ammunition of the artillery and of
small-arms.</p>

<p>Of course the details of powder-mills, of cannon foundries, of
artillery workshops, of laboratories and small-arms manufactories, are
here to be explained.</p>

<p>The action of projectiles and the mode of applying it, are to be
scientifically explained, by the aid of the parabolic and projectile
theory, as well as the principles upon which artillery experiments are
to be conducted.</p>

<p>Finally, the principles of the management of the artillery material
in the artillery dépôts are to be explained.</p>

<p>4. The course of instruction will be closed by an historical
description of the progress of artillery, and by an historical review of
its literature.</p>

subjects for the first cœtus must be taught in the prescribed
periods.</p>

<p>The lecture in the first cœtus must by no means be a mere mechanical
preparation for the <i>Officer’s examination</i>; even here the
understanding of the pupil is not to remain unoccupied, though the
memory is to be had recourse to in a very high degree, and the
historical form, that is, description of objects as they are,
predominates.</p>

<p>The principles of the arrangements can only be taken up in their
chief features, (partly because) time will not allow a farther advance,
and partly because the progress of the students in the other studies is
not yet sufficiently forward.</p>

<p>In the second cœtus the advantage has been obtained that the students
have gained a knowledge of the entire material of artillery in its
various relations, and the lecture gives, therefore, an introduction to
the use of artillery in the field and in sieges; and with special regard
to a fundamental knowledge of the details, and with the view to what is
necessary to complete the Engineer pupil and make an efficient
preparation of the Artillerist for the third cœtus, aims at a somewhat
more scientific treatment, without going into the full comprehensive
details reserved for the latter student. For the same reason, this
portion of the lectures is confined nearly throughout to the explanation
of existing conditions of our artillery, and only where the necessities
of the Engineer student may demand it, can mention be made of the
earlier material, or of the most important matters of foreign
artilleries.</p>

<p>The instruction, therefore, of the first and second cœtus is directed
more to the general and historical, that of the third cœtus, more to the
special and scientific culture of the student; the materials were there
collected which are here to be worked up.</p>

<p>From this general point of view proceed also the methods which are to
be observed by the teachers in each cœtus.</p>

<p>The principal point to be kept hold of in all three cœtus is, that
everything that can be shown the students, or which they can learn by
their own manipulation, should be brought visibly before them, and as
far as time and circumstances permit, should be actually put in
practice. The material objects, in their actual state for use, must as
often as possible be shown and explained, for which the Practical
Exercises offer the best opportunity to which reference is here
therefore made.</p>

<p>After these, a collection of models, diagrams, tables, and literary
notices are necessary, which may be partly used for immediate
instruction in the class, and partly furnished the pupils as a necessary
and time-saving aid to the memory.</p>

<p>Deficiencies in these aids to the lectures are to be laid before the
Direction and Board of Studies by the teacher, and supplied as far as
the existing means allow.</p>

<p>Those cases in which the proceedings are fixed by certain regulations
require special mention; for instance, the transport of powder,
examination of cannon, drills, harnessing of horses, stable and camp
service, &amp;c.</p>

<p>All these regulations are grounded on certain principles, from which
no deviation can take place without evil. The method of drawing them up
is, however, variable, on which times and circumstances, and even the
views of the superior authorities, have influence.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page373" id = "page373">373</a></span>
<p>It is, therefore, highly necessary that in this respect the essential
be carefully in the instruction separated from the accidental, and by
omitting the latter, not only gain time, but hinder that the students
accustom themselves in a slovenly manner to look only to forms, and to
seek in them the true being and life of artillery.</p>

<p>A true exposition of the principles on which these regulations rest
ought not to be omitted from the lectures. They will suffice to prepare
the students to act correctly in every case that occurs, for which
actual service gives them, moreover, the separate instruction. The more
completely the teacher keeps this point in view the less need he fear to
form his pupils to immature critics, since the well-informed officer
will more easily enter into the spirit of each such regulation, and more
exactly carry it into execution for the benefit of the service, than he
who has been accustomed to keep without reflection only to the dead
letter; this, in the varied phases of practical life, will often enough
leave him without guidance, unless he knows how to find it within
himself.</p>

<p>As amongst the many existing class and hand-books for the artillery,
none is entirely adapted to form a basis for the lectures, the formation
of a special plan of lectures for each cœtus is indispensable, that the
lecturer may have a defined path, and the students an assistance in
their repetitions.</p>


<h5><a name = "prussia_berlin_engin" id = "prussia_berlin_engin" href =
"#prussia_berlin_subjects">II. GENERAL AND SPECIAL ENGINEERING IN THE
FIRST AND SECOND CŒTUS</a></h5>

<p>The lecture commences with the first principles of fortification,
supposes no previous knowledge, and comprises&mdash;</p>

<div class = "inlist">
<p>(<i>a.</i>) Field fortification, attack and defense of a redoubt,
communication in the field, and,</p>

<p>(<i>b.</i>) Permanent fortification, the art of besieging, with the
example of a siege that has actually taken place.</p>
</div>

<p>In the first cœtus it must be so far carried out that the pupil is
capable of passing his <i>Officer’s examination</i> according to the
regulation of the 26th March, 1846. In the second cœtus the general
knowledge of field and permanent fortification acquired in the first is
carried on in such a degree as both Artillery and Engineer officers
require to form a good foundation for the particular professional study
of both arms in the third cœtus.</p>

<p>In the formation of the special plan of the lecture the
instruction-regulations for artillery and exclusive engineering in the
third cœtus are to be kept in view, so as to prepare for these subjects
by the nature and the method of the instruction.</p>

<p>The principal contents of the lecture are&mdash;</p>


<p class = "smallhead"><a name = "prussia_berlin_eng1" id =
"prussia_berlin_eng1" href = "#prussia_berlin_engin">A. IN THE FIRST
CŒTUS.</a></p>

<p class = "heading">a. <i>In Field Fortification.</i></p>

<p>A correct description of the profile, the ground plan, the technical
obstacles and modes of strengthening, the construction, and elementarily
also, the use of field-works; attack and defense of a redoubt, and the
military communications in the field, as roads, fords, and bridges.</p>


<p class = "heading">b. <i>In Permanent Fortification.</i></p>

<p>Exposition of the essential principles for plan and profile;
acquaintance with the parts of a bastioned fortress with the outworks;
special acquaintance with
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page374" id = "page374">374</a></span>
a work on Vauban’s first system, and its improvements by Cormontaigne.
Knowledge of the characteristics of the Italian, Dutch, and French
fortification, of the ideas of Rimpler and Montalembert, as well as of
the latest fortifications in Prussia; lastly, a knowledge of sieges as
regards a regular attack and defense. The art of construction is taught
to the Engineers in the third cœtus.</p>


<p class = "smallhead"><a name = "prussia_berlin_eng2" id =
"prussia_berlin_eng2" href = "#prussia_berlin_engin">B. IN THE SECOND
CŒTUS.</a></p>

<p>Applied art of fortification, and, namely, attack and defense of the
various sorts of field-works, castrametation, permanent fortification,
provisional fortification, and sieges. At their proper places, are to be
introduced the precepts of military constructions which are suitable
alike to the Artillerist and the Engineer, as well as the conduct of
infantry and cavalry, and the duty of the Engineers in sieges.</p>


<p class = "heading"><i>Distribution of Time.</i></p>

<p>The first cœtus receives four, the second three hours weekly;
therefore, in thirty-five weeks, the first 140, the second 105 hours.
The number of hours which are to be dedicated to each portion will be
indicated by the teacher in his special plan of the lectures, as it in
part depends upon his experiences. All the above-named subjects must,
however, be gone through within the prescribed period.</p>

<p>Before every principal division of the lectures, a general statement
of its purport and essential principles is given; then follows a short
historical exposition which is to explain the connection, the
employment, and the thence arising conditions of the subject under
consideration in reference to the other parts of the art of war.</p>

<p>The precepts hence deducible on the form of the parts of a
fortification, and on the subsisting relations of fighting, are to form
the latest and principal portion of each lecture.</p>

<p>The lecture is to be given in detail in such a manner, that its
precepts may be deduced from one another in a way suited to the powers
of perception of the pupils, and their mental powers accustomed to the
carrying out of principles, rather than to a blind adherence to absolute
regulations. To avoid repetition, the details of those doctrines which
belong to different places are to be given only once, namely, where they
are first required; and afterwards reference only made to them.</p>

<p>The military element, as indispensable both for the Artillerist and
Engineer alike, is to be kept continually in view.</p>

<p>As regards the principal divisions, oral repetitions may be made from
time to time for greater clearness; and, since individual and continued
attention and self-reflection alone render a well-grounded progress in
the student possible, written themes, besides those prescribed, are
particularly recommended. It will not be necessary to submit each
individual essay to a separate correction, but the teacher may content
himself each time with giving a general view of important defects in the
treatment of the subject, and then reading aloud one or more of the
essays that have best succeeded, and showing by their analysis how the
subject could be best treated.</p>

<p>In both cœtus, the existing models and full sized drawings in the
school, as also the models in the arsenal, and for the second cœtus more
especially the models of fortresses in the model-house, are to be
used.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page375" id = "page375">375</a></span>
<p>The means employed to complete the instruction in both cœtus, are
fortification drawing, practical exercise in field-works, and an
inspection of the fortress of Spandau.</p>

<p>The lectures are given without any fixed hand-book, from manuscript
drafts or notes.</p>


<h5><a name = "prussia_berlin_excl" id = "prussia_berlin_excl" href =
"#prussia_berlin_subjects">III. EXCLUSIVE ENGINEERING IN THE THIRD
CŒTUS.</a></h5>

<p>The instruction in General Engineering in the first cœtus was
intended to teach the Artillerist and Engineer so much of the art of
fortification, of sieges, and of field-works as is requisite for
officers of every arm, and is necessary for the students to pass their
<i>Officer’s examination</i>.</p>

<p>In the second cœtus this instruction was enlarged, and connected with
its application to field and permanent fortification, to such extent as
the kindred arms of the artillery and engineer corps required equally to
know, that they may execute effectually their separate duties in
fortification and sieges.</p>

<p>The instruction in Exclusive Engineering in the third cœtus is,
however, intended solely for Engineers, as it teaches only professional
matters which the engineer shares with no other arm of the service;
while, on the other hand, the Artillerist receives a special instruction
in those branches which are only necessary for the artillery
officer.</p>

<p>Since the lectures would receive a too great and heterogeneous
extension, if to them were to be added that portion of hydraulics which
the engineer officer ought to know, without being immediately connected
with his military constructions, and if further, civil architecture
applied to military buildings was touched on, these subjects will be
taught contemporaneously in the third cœtus by special instructors, and
are therefore in the lectures on Exclusive Engineering not to pass the
limits of that instruction. Their respective teachers must receive
reciprocally special information of each other’s plan of lectures, and
give mutual help by communications and inquiries where the studies might
come into collision.</p>

<p>The teacher of the Exclusive Engineer class must learn the extent of
those subjects of instruction which have been already treated in the
lectures on Special Engineering in the second cœtus, and not only by
inspection of the programme, but by personal consultation with their
respective teachers.</p>

<p>In more remote relation, the instruction connects itself with the
earlier lectures on artillery, tactics, history of the art of war,
mathematics, physics, chemistry, and the exercises in plan-drawing and
surveying. The special programmes of instruction of these branches of
study are also to be taken notice of by the teacher, that nothing may be
twice taught, and that where the use of doctrines from those studies is
necessary, he may merely refer to them historically.</p>

<p>This instruction comprises, after an introduction, the following
principal divisions.</p>

<p>1. The application of the rules for sieges already given to
particular cases, with a general regard to the ground, more especially
of irregular fortresses, shown by various remarkable sieges.</p>

<p>2. A theory of construction as auxiliary science in the execution of
engineering works for field or permanent fortification, and in the
execution of military constructions: building materials, modes of
building, and the application of both for given purposes.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page376" id = "page376">376</a></span>
<p>To this part belong&mdash;</p>

<p><i>a.</i> A knowledge of the different building materials from the
animal, vegetable, and mineral kingdoms; their production and
preparation for various building purposes, and the data, so important in
practice, regarding their durability and mode of employment.</p>

<p><i>b.</i> The theory of the use and combination of these building
materials for constructive purposes, and of the building of separate
portions of an edifice.</p>

<p><i>c.</i> The foundations of buildings and the means of improving the
foundation bottoms.</p>

<p><i>d.</i> Construction of ordinary buildings, as inclosures, inclined
or unloaded revetments, loopholed walls, barracks and hospitals,
dwelling and guard-houses, military prisons, stables, magazines, such as
arsenals, wagon sheds, provision stores, bakeries, powder magazines,
laboratories, communications, mines, weirs and stop-sluices,
ice-breakers, &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>e.</i> Principles of machinery, with explanations of the forces
necessary to move machines, with notice of the most common for raising
and moving weights, for pumping, draining, dredging, &amp;c.</p>

<p>3. The art, to apply the knowledge gained by the foregoing lectures
by means of projects for certain special purposes, and under given
circumstances of ground, such as his service may require of an Engineer
Officer. The application of field fortification to given portions of
ground is alone excepted, since the teacher of applied
Fortification-drawing has this especially assigned to him, who still is
only to give out his projects in unison with the teacher of Exclusive
Engineering.</p>

<p>There belongs to this part&mdash;</p>

<p><i>a.</i> The method of preparing plans and estimates of buildings,
in the manner treated of under 2, at (<i>c</i>) and (<i>d</i>,)
illustrated by frequent practice in making out such plans.</p>

<p><i>b.</i> Practice in plans for special objects and given ground,
which latter is to be chosen in the neighborhood of the fortress of
Spandau.</p>

<p><i>c.</i> Instructions generally conceived on the duties in a
fortress of an Officer of Engineers, and on the practice of building in
Prussian fortresses.</p>

<p><i>d.</i> As appendix, notices on the formation and preservation of
hedges, and plantations of shrubs and trees.</p>

<p>The time fixed for this instruction amounts in thirty-five weeks, at
ten hours each, to 350 hours, which, according to the importance of the
different sections, may, as a general rule, be appropriated as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>The more particular distribution of this general division of time is
matter of the special lesson plan, and it only remains to be observed,
that with the approval of the Director, some afternoons are to be taken
for viewing the most remarkable buildings in Berlin and neighborhood;
and in conjunction with the
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page377" id = "page377">377</a></span>
teacher of applied Fortification-drawing, three days are to be set apart
for a recognizance of the works of the fortress of Spandau, relative to
the projects of fortifications mentioned under 3 at (<i>b.</i>)</p>

<p>The two first sections of this instruction, namely, the continuation
of the instruction on sieges, and the theory of construction, keep their
place in the regular lectures of the school, though naturally they have
an immediate applicability to practical service, and the lectures
therefore ought to be made his own by the pupil by frequent exercises
and detailed plans.</p>

<p>The projects for a given ground, on the contrary, must be worked out
by the pupils in conformity with the instruction given, as much as
possible independently, and as on service a young officer would do under
the guidance of his superior. The drawings need not be entirely shaded,
but may be partially executed by lines only, but they must be distinct
and clean. Here, as in Fortification-drawing, the prescriptions of the
Engineer regulation of the 25th of April, 1820, are to be observed, a
copy of which is therefore always present in the drawing-room, that they
may be seen by each student. Attention is to be given also to the
correctness of the scale, to correct coloring, entry on the drawing of
the date when done, and of the name as well as the rank of the student,
as directed by the above regulation.</p>

<p>In the exercises all propositions for improvements which vary from
the mode of practice now in use are excluded.</p>

<p>The teaching auxiliaries are the books and models of the school.</p>


<h5><a name = "prussia_berlin_hydr" id = "prussia_berlin_hydr" href =
"#prussia_berlin_subjects">IV. HYDRAULIC CONSTRUCTIONS IN THE THIRD
CŒTUS.</a></h5>

<p>The instruction in hydraulics is to comprehend:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Those general principles of hydraulic architecture which in the
lectures on Exclusive Engineering in the third cœtus of the school could
not be specially explained without extending them too far, and therefore
were there taken for granted.</p>

<p>2. Such hydraulic works, as do not immediately come within the scope
of military buildings, and therefore could not be included in a lecture
on Exclusive Engineering, but which on account of their connection with
the profession of an Engineer Officer in general, independently of
military construction proper, ought to be known by him in their most
important principles.</p>

<p>Since in the instruction in engineering in the third cœtus,
opportunities offer for projects of fortification, with application of
the theoretical principles given above (at&nbsp;1,) the exercise
problems for the instruction in hydraulic architecture need only extend
to those hydraulic works (at&nbsp;2,) not referring to
fortification.</p>

<p>The instruction is in immediate connection with the lectures on
mathematics, physics, and exclusive engineering, the last of which will
be lectured on at the same time as hydraulics; the lectures on physics
and that portion of mathematics which is here necessary, with the
exception of hydraulics, have been already treated in the first cœtus.
In arranging the plan of the lectures, and in carrying it out, the plans
for those sciences must be considered, and conferences held with the
teachers it may concern, to prevent the frequent repetition of the same
subject.</p>

<p>The entire number of hours is seventy, two of which are given weekly,
<span class = "pagenum">

<p>To make the lecture plainer, and to exercise the student in
comprehending existing hydraulic buildings, eight afternoons, at the
choice of the teacher, after a previous consultation with the director,
are to be appropriated to the inspection and drawing of hydraulic
constructions, at Berlin, namely, the sluices and mills.</p>

<p>Although this instruction embraces a large field in a very short
period, it must not be extended over too many objects, but rather to be
confined to what is indispensable to the practical use of the engineer;
the matter of these, however, to be treated fundamentally and
thoroughly, and all superficiality be avoided.</p>

<p>The lectures are to be given from private notes, without any
prescribed hand-book.</p>


<h5><a name = "prussia_berlin_tactics" id = "prussia_berlin_tactics"
href = "#prussia_berlin_subjects">V. TACTICS.</a></h5>

<p class = "heading"><i>In the First Cœtus.</i></p>

<p>The Students of the first cœtus are to receive a thorough instruction
in elementary tactics, and the employment of the different arms, both
separately and united. The object is not merely that they may pass the
<i>Officer’s examination</i>, but that they may gain true general ideas
on these subjects, which ought not to be strange to a well-informed
officer of any arm. A&nbsp;frequent illustration of the lectures
delivered, by examples and problems for actual ground, is particularly
recommended.</p>

<p>Lectures on tactics are closely connected with those on artillery,
fortification, rules of the service; and in certain respects the
lectures on plan-drawing and veterinary art, as well as practical
exercises in surveying.</p>

<p>More especially&mdash;</p>

<p><i>a.</i> In artillery: Construction of cannon, of small-arms and
side-arms, choice and training of horses for artillery service;
organization of the artillery; regulation for the artillery on march and
in camp; use of artillery in the field, as regards the specialties of
its position, movement, and mode of fighting. The use of artillery in
general, in attack and defense, with the use of the reserve
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page379" id = "page379">379</a></span>
artillery in more important battles, in village skirmishes, passage of
rivers and defiles, and field fortifications, belongs to the lectures on
artillery, but only in the second cœtus; these subjects are therefore to
be treated historically with tactics, as far as knowledge of them is
required for the <i>Officer’s examination</i>. As a general principle,
however, all the relations of detail in the constitution or the
specialties of artillery are to be treated in the lectures on that
science; in the tactics, on the contrary, only the more general
relations which concern all the arms of the service, and where the
artillery acts in union with infantry and cavalry.</p>

<p><i>b.</i> In Fortification; the designing and construction of
field-works and all means of obstruction. The manner in which ground in
general, and the given position in particular, is to be used for the
throwing up field-works. Attack and defense of field-works. Complete
exposition of the art of sieges.</p>

<p><i>c.</i> Veterinary art. Natural history, physiology, and general
nourishment of the horse.</p>

<p><i>d.</i> Plan-drawing and surveying. Everything that is to be said
on the general physical laws of the form of the earth’s surface, and
specially on a knowledge of topography and its representation.</p>

<p><i>e.</i> Rules of the service. A knowledge of military style.
Discipline in all its various branches. The internal service on
detachments, convoys, and separate commands, and some historical remarks
on the provisioning of an army.</p>

<p>The lectures embrace the following principal sections:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Introduction. General ideas of war. War materials. Aim of war.
Conduct of war. Tactics and strategy. Army organization.</p>

<p>2. Organization of the Prussian army. Raising and equipping the
troops. Formation and strength. Replacing of men and materials.
Supplies.</p>

<p>3. Special ideas of tactics. Forming, changing position, and combat.
Close and open fighting; distant and near fighting. Offensive and
defensive. The enemy. The ground. Characteristics of the different sorts
of troops. A&nbsp;short sketch of the development of tactics up to their
present state.</p>

<p>4. The proscribed tactics of the infantry, cavalry, and artillery
according to the Prussian regulations.</p>

<p>5. Ideas on the combination of the three Arms and order of
battle.</p>

<p>6. Influence of ground on the use of troops. Classification of ground
and cognizance of the individual objects on it.</p>

<p>7. Occupation, attack, and defense of objects on the ground, as
heights, valleys, woods, river lines, farm-buildings, inhabited places,
defiles, bridges, dykes.</p>

<p>8. Security of troops on a march. Service of advanced posts.
Reconnaissances. Special duties for detachments, as escorting convoys in
our own or enemy’s country; foraging, surprises, ambuscades, covering of
works in the field. In conclusion, some remarks on partizan warfare.</p>

<p>The total number of hours comprises, according to the regulation, in
thirty-five weeks at four hours each, 140 hours, of which are to be
employed:&mdash;</p>

<p>The lectures on tactics furnish the student with the positive
knowledge that is necessary as a general basis; but further care is
particularly taken that by the application of the problems put before
the students their knowledge is not made up of mere dead knowledge, but
that throughout their understandings are exercised. It is, therefore, a
special duty of the teacher to frame his lectures accordingly, and as
well by a development of the basis upon which the organization, the
elementary tactics, and the art of war is founded, as also by very
frequent exercises given to the pupils on the lectures to press towards
this end.</p>

<p>For the solution of the tactical problems, a number of plans of
ground is necessary. They are obtained on the requisition of the teacher
through the Director.</p>

<p>It is further necessary to illustrate the use of the different troops
upon the ground itself, as well for attack as defense, and to have the
examples and problems given by the teachers sketched by the scholars.
For such exercises four days of two or three hours each will
suffice.</p>

<p>Of the existing hand-books, none appears perfectly qualified to serve
as a basis for instruction. The filling in, therefore, of a sketch of
the lectures, and of a special plan of instruction, is indispensable to
give the teacher a fixed basis, and the scholars an assistance in their
repetitions.</p>


<h5><a name = "prussia_berlin_math" id = "prussia_berlin_math" href =
"#prussia_berlin_subjects">VI. MATHEMATICS.</a></h5>

<p>The mathematical lecture, besides its general tendency to sharpen the
intellect, is to make the scholars acquainted with all those theories
and laws which are indispensable to the Artillery and Engineer officer
to enable him to solve with certainty and ease those problems which so
often meet him in the service.</p>

<p>Since these problems in part require the application of rules of the
higher branches of mathematics, lectures on these ought not to be
wanting, and consequently the mathematical instruction for at least a
portion of the pupils must embrace (with few exceptions) the entire
field of this science.</p>

<p>In order, however, that this demand be accommodated to the time at
disposal and the capabilities of the students, the following rules are
to be observed:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The students of the first cœtus having already passed their
examination for <i>Portépée ensign</i>, and the Predicate <i>ziemlich
gut</i>, in their mathematical examination, being requisite for entry
into the School, it is to be presumed that they enter with a good or at
least sufficient preparatory knowledge. Still, as it is not to be
expected that the necessary requirement in arithmetic and algebra will
be possessed throughout, the first part of the instruction must be
considered as the most important, and be given thoroughly and
fundamentally.</p>

<p>2. Such portions of mathematics as are less necessary for
Artillerists and Engineers (for instance, astronomy and the higher
geodesy,) are to be entirely omitted from the lectures.</p>

<p>3. As even in such portions as fall within the scope of the lectures,
there is much that can not be exhausted, therefore all that belongs
solely to speculative views, or possibly only serves to the rounding or
perfecting a system, must be passed over. The instruction in mathematics
stands in near and frequent connection with the lectures on artillery,
architecture, mechanics, physics, theory of surveying, and with drawing
lessons, as well as with practical mensuration.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page381" id = "page381">381</a></span>
<p>These belong specially&mdash;</p>

<p><i>a.</i> To Artillery: architecture, mechanics; the application of
all those formulas which the mathematical lectures have to deduce and to
prove.</p>

<p><i>b.</i> To Physics: the theories of dioptrics, and catoptrics,
which the students require to a perfect understanding of the
construction of telescopes and reflecting instruments; what is necessary
from aerometry and aerostatics.</p>

<p><i>c.</i> To Drawing lessons: practical working out of the theory of
perspection, and the construction of shadows.</p>

<p><i>d.</i> To the theory of Surveying: a knowledge of all the
instruments requisite for mensuration and leveling, and the principal
theorems, with their application to cases occurring in mensuration.</p>

<p>The lectures on mathematics form of themselves a continuous, closely
connected whole; consequently, the same teacher who gave instruction in
the first cœtus is to retain his pupils in the second, so that each of
the two teachers commence with the first cœtus in alternate years.</p>

<p>For the third cœtus there will be a selection made of those students
who have made themselves noticed in the second cœtus by distinguished
ability, special application, and peculiar talent for the study of
mathematics, and have thus raised hopes that they may be conducted with
success into the higher branches of the science.</p>

<p>They form a separate division, whose number should always be small if
the selection be guided strictly by the contemplated purpose. All the
other students of the third cœtus form a second division, in which the
entire field of what they have already been taught in mathematics is
again gone over, with a view to its application; and at the end of this
course some other subjects necessary to the Artillerist and Engineer are
to be treated, without, however, mere scientific speculations.</p>

<p>For each of these divisions a separate teacher is appointed.</p>

<p class = "heading">E. <span class = "smallroman">GENERAL APPROPRIATION
OF TIME.</span></p>

<p>The number of lessons (hours) amounts, according to the prescribed
plan for the first and second cœtus, to six hours, for each division of
the third cœtus four hours, weekly; if the course be taken, after
deducting the holidays and other interruptions, at thirty-five weeks,
then there will be for the first and second cœtus, 210, and for each
division of the third, 140 hours.</p>

<p>The number of hours to be devoted to each portion must, in the first
instance, be determined by the teacher in his special lecture plan, as
it in part depends upon his previous experience; at all events, all the
above-named themes for the first cœtus must be treated in the stated
time. Only in special cases, in the second and third cœtus, can the
omission or transposition of one or the other, on reference to the
higher authorities, be permitted.</p>

<p>It has been already remarked that the course of mathematics should
impart to the students not only that amount of positive knowledge which
he requires
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page383" id = "page383">383</a></span>
for his immediate sphere of action and needs as incitement and guide to
further study, but also should fill the important purpose of forming the
mind of the students generally. This purpose will be the more certainly
gained the more the teacher is enabled to render the scholar
self-trusting, and in each separate study to lead to the development of
a few select principles simple and easily understood, but comprising in
natural and logical connection the whole theory, so that the scholar
fancies they are his own discovery, and therefore prizes them as his
own. The teacher must, therefore, gradually propose a series of
connected inquiries, and those naturally first on which the usual
systems are based, as questions to which the students have to submit
answers deduced from the above-named principles, with constant
application of simple common sense. By these means the students are not
only continually gaining single results, made ready to their hand by
use, but what is principally desired, they acquire thereby great mental
activity.</p>

<p>As regards instruction in the separate cœtus, the following rules are
to be observed:&mdash;</p>

<p>At the commencement in the first cœtus, the teacher should endeavor,
by frequent questions to form a full and correct judgment of the
previous knowledge of each student, that he may determine how he should
proceed with his lecture, slower or quicker, and to what subjects
generally for the entire class special notice and exercise should be
devoted.</p>

<p>The most complete exercise of the elementary rules, forming, as it
does, the indispensable basis for all future progress is in this cœtus
the principal aim of the teacher.</p>

<p>In the second cœtus, in the application of the theory of co-ordinates
to the commonest curves, no investigation of the specialties of the
theory of curves is necessary, because this is reserved for later
lectures, and it would here abridge the time required for subjects of
nearer interest. The development of these theories must, therefore, be
confined to the simplest elementary use. The study, too, of the analysis
of finite numbers is to be continued only so far as the student requires
for immediate application, without any intention of going deeper into
the science. On the other hand, a suitably increased time is to be given
to statics and hydrostatics, because the student ought to be acquainted
with them in the most complete manner.</p>

<p>As the first division of the third cœtus consists of but few and only
the best scholars, it may be required of them to work out independently
at home separate questions given by the teacher, and submit them to him
for examination. The progress of the student is more surely gained and
advanced, the oftener he has opportunity of personally discovering
mathematical truths, or by applying them to examples to come to a
clearer comprehension and use of them.</p>

<p>In the second division the teacher will not always be able to avoid
giving a repetition of the reasons of propositions. This is necessary
when he perceives from the work or expressions of the students, that the
majority have not perfectly comprehended the proposition. Still the
teacher will here content himself with bringing forward the most
important points in the chain of deduction. The explanatory problems are
solved by the teacher himself, who then sets similar ones for working
out by the students at home.</p>

<p>For practical static problems, the teacher can use with great benefit
objects often occurring in common life, and yet regarded so little; the
numerous applications
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page384" id = "page384">384</a></span>
of the lever, of the inclined plane, &amp;c., by artillerists and
engineers, for their works, carriages, draught, &amp;c., furnish
sufficient material for such problems; as for instance, determination of
the depth of a boat of given length and breadth when after putting into
it a piece of ordnance a given height out of water is required;
determination of the power requisite to overcome the resistance of a log
lying in the track of a vessel; determination of the pressure of a laden
beam on two or more supports with reference to the flexibility of the
beam; determination of the center of gravity in an excentric hollow
shot, both theoretically with given radius and known centers, as well as
more practically when the centers and the radius of its interior are
unknown, as by dipping the hollow shot into quicksilver; determination
of the counterpoise of a drawbridge and examination of the best position
for the axle ; investigation of the strength of metal and wood pipes
which are to serve as water-pipes at given heights of pressure,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>At the same time the teacher ought not to leave unnoticed the
advantages which theory can offer to practice when rightly applied, by
which is in no way meant that the practical man should enter every time
into a prolix and anxious calculation, but from the improvement his mind
and capacities have received, he may apply readily what he has learnt to
the purposes of common life.</p>

<p>Dynamics and hydraulics will be rather treated in a physical and
historical point of view; here, too, the application of known
professional results is the principal object.</p>

<p>As the limited time will not allow separate mathematical repetitions,
the teacher should therefore be the more careful to make his lectures as
much as possible applicatory. To insure progress the students must,
besides the usual writing out the lecture, have frequent themes given to
them for work at home, and of which their own execution should be
secured by proper means.</p>

<p>It is perfectly necessary that a hand-book should form the basis of
the instruction, from which the teacher should lecture, and the students
make repetitions.</p>

<p>The hand-books are to be proposed by the teacher to the Board of
Studies, and must not be changed without permission.</p>

<p>These books, as well as the logarithm tables, every student must have
a copy of, as he can not do without them in the school, and may
frequently require them in future life.</p>

<p>Models of solids, to illustrate the projection theory, are in the
collection of the models of the school.</p>


<h5><a name = "prussia_berlin_art" id = "prussia_berlin_art" href =
"#prussia_berlin_subjects">VII. PRACTICAL ARTILLERY EXERCISES.</a></h5>

<p>The practical artillery exercises are intended, in the first place,
to furnish the students with a sight of that portion of the material of
the artillery which they have had no previous opportunity of knowing,
and of which the knowledge is indispensable for a complete understanding
of the theoretical lecture. The exercises should follow the lecture as
immediately as possible, and occur therefore during the continuance of
the theoretical course.</p>

<p>The students are besides to become acquainted with the methods of
execution of the most important artillery duties, in an extent
compatible with their position, and the time at their disposition. For
this portion of the exercises, the months of July, August and September
are to be preferred.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page385" id = "page385">385</a></span>
<p>In the major part of these exercises, the engineer students take part
so as to gain a knowledge of such parts of the artillery service as seem
to be of the greatest importance to them.</p>

<p>The artillery exercises separate into numerous subdivisions, of which
the following may be particularly remarked:&mdash;</p>


<p class = "heading">I. <span class = "smallroman">EXERCISES OF THE
FIRST COETUS.</span></p>

<p class = "heading">A. <i>Visits.</i></p>

<p>The visits happen, as already noted, at the period of the theoretical
instruction. The students are to be divided into as many sections as is
necessary, that each may gain the desired information. There belong to
this part&mdash;</p>

<p><i>a.</i> Visiting the foundry and the boring machine. All the
students of the first coetus are to be taken by the artillery teacher of
this coetus, on two afternoons, to the foundry, and to the new boring
machine.</p>

<p>They will see the general construction of the foundry and the boring
machine, and, in case such work is going on, the molding, boring, and
turning, and receive the explanations necessary.</p>

<p><i>b.</i> Examination of ordnance, gun-carriages, and ammunition
wagons.</p>

<p>Those in the arsenal, as well as the exercising pieces of the
regiment of artillery of the guard, are to be used for this purpose, to
exhibit the construction of ordnance both in the Prussian and foreign
artilleries, and also those of an earlier date, from the specimens kept
there. In the same way as has been remarked for the ordnance, the
gun-carriages and equipages of the guard artillery regiment in store
will offer opportunity for a more exact scrutiny of these carriages,
limbers, and wagons. For these visits four afternoons are to be
taken.</p>

<p><i>c.</i> Visit to the workshops of the artillery:&mdash;</p>

<p>The students will, in two afternoons, gain there a knowledge of the
following objects:</p>

<p>1. The mode of work in general.</p>

<p>2. Processes in the manufacture of the most important objects of
artillery material, as axles, wheels, carriages, mountings, sponges,
harness, ropes, &amp;c.</p>

<p>3. The raw material (wood, iron, leather.)</p>

<p>4. Objects furnished to field, siege, and fortress artillery.</p>

<p><i>d.</i> Visit to the small-arms factory and powder-mills in
Spandau:&mdash;</p>

<p>The scholars of the first coetus will be conducted into both
manufactories, to obtain a general insight into the various works.</p>

<p>In order that the work of the manufactories may receive no
interruption, the teacher of the first coetus is to communicate
beforehand with their respective superintendents, and take the students
in suitable small parties, and before entering the powder manufactory to
insist, most carefully, on all the proper precautions being
observed.</p>

<p>These visits are to take place during the theoretical course on the
same day as is fixed for the first coetus to visit the fortress of
Spandau to study its fortifications; and, therefore, an agreement should
be made between the teacher of artillery and the teacher of general
engineering.</p>

<p><i>e.</i> Visit to the armory at the arsenal:&mdash;</p>

<p>The students are to be conducted on an afternoon to the armory of the
arsenal, where the superintendent will explain to them the peculiarities
of match
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page386" id = "page386">386</a></span>
and wheel locks, with the most remarkable projects for loading at the
breech, and with the form of small arms amongst other nations.</p>


<p class = "heading">B. <i>Exercises.</i></p>

<p><i>a.</i> Examination of small arms:&mdash;</p>

<p>The students are to be taken by their teacher to the musket
manufactory, where they will be shown the mode of proof of small arms in
general, and with reference to the theoretical lecture then in
progress.</p>

<p>Each student then receives a faulty musket, with direction to examine
and note its defects. The teacher revises and corrects these notes.</p>

<p><i>b.</i> The management of machines:</p>

<p>In the presence of the students the management of various machines,
&amp;c., as well as the repair of damaged carriages, will be undertaken.
According to the means at disposal, such exercises will be selected as
are most instructive, in exhibiting arrangement, strength, and care in
their application.</p>

<p>The students will be permitted to lend a hand only in such cases as
it is foreseen that their strength will be sufficient. For all other
purposes where strength is necessary, workmen must be employed.</p>


<p class = "heading">II. <span class = "smallroman">EXERCISES IN THE
SECOND CŒTUS.</span></p>

<p>When the teacher judges proper, some of the previous visits are
repeated on the afternoons disposable during the theoretical course.</p>


<p class = "heading">A. <i>Marking out and Tracing Batteries.</i></p>

<p>The students undertake these exercises under inspection of their
teacher of artillery on two days in the last three months of the
course.</p>

<p>The teacher instructs them then how to ascertain the prolongation of
the enemy’s lines, and the mode of determining the line of fire of the
first embrasure of the different batteries, as well as the other points
to be marked out, both with the use of the usual instruments, and with
simple measurement by pacing, and laying down right angles by the
eye.</p>

<p>A complete construction of a battery is not possible on account of
the shortness of time, paucity of means, and strength of the students.
The exercise, therefore, is confined to an explanation of the formation
of the material and tool depots; to marking out and tracing horizontal
and sunk batteries on even, irregular, and sloping ground, and to the
construction of the powder magazine.</p>


<p class = "heading">B. <i>Practical Exemplification of the Rules for
Placing Ordnance according to the Ground.</i></p>

<p>These exercises are to be carried out on two afternoons by all the
students, under the inspection of their artillery teacher.</p>

<p>They have only reference to the ground, and leave out of
consideration all tactical considerations. This object may be fully
attained even without guns, and the necessary instruction may be given
without them, as it would not be easy to form all the batteries in the
desired number.</p>

<p>The teacher chooses the ground, explains it by means of a plan to the
students, and goes with them to the place. He divides them into various
sections, and lets each select positions for from two to eight pieces,
both for attack and defence with different kinds of ordnance, giving
only generally the direction and distance at which the enemy is
operating.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page387" id = "page387">387</a></span>
<p>Each position is inspected by the teacher, and the views and reasons
for it received and discussed as regards effect, mode of firing, and
covering and free movement, and where it is necessary, improved; and at
the same time the requisite precautions taken for the limbers and
wagons.</p>


<p class = "heading">C. <i>Drawings of Ordnance Carriages and
Wagons.</i></p>

<p>These exercises are to be undertaken by the artillerists of the
second cœtus, under inspection of the teacher of artillery-drawing, on
twelve afternoons in June.</p>

<p>The drawing of a piece of ordnance is to be clearly distinguished
from the examination of it. For the first, taking the necessary measures
is alone necessary, but not their comparison with given models.</p>

<p>The teacher will order these exercises, so that the students learn
principally&mdash;</p>

<p>1. What scale they ought to take for a given object, so as to execute
a drawing with the precision necessary for being afterwards worked
from.</p>

<p>2. With what instruments and method of procedure they may most easily
obtain their end.</p>

<p>3. How notices of improvements are to be taken and arranged.</p>

<p>4. How the rough draft is to be jotted down.</p>

<p>It must be here particularly remarked that our guns, carriages,
&amp;c., have no mathematically exact forms, and that therefore the
number of measures to be taken must be often multiplied to have a true
figure of the body.</p>

<p>A fair drawing from these measures in the above period is so much the
less possible, as the number of objects is as much as possible
multiplied. It is fully sufficient, however, for the purpose of this
exercise, that the students learn to take complete and useful rough
drafts.</p>

<p>On their entrance into the third cœtus, the complete drawings from
these rough drafts take place.</p>

<p>In his selection of objects to be drawn, the teacher must, in having
regard to variety, take care that the drawings by too great difficulty
do not exceed the time and power of the students, nor by too great
simplicity cease to be instructive.</p>

<p>Ordnance carriages, limbers, wagons, and the machines required in
artillery, are the most suitable for choice, and are easiest obtainable
in the arsenal.</p>

<p>The students must be divided into sub-sections, of at most three or
four persons, and to each a separate task given.</p>

<p>The teacher is to be present at the drawings to see to their proper
execution, and has delivered to him the notices and rough sketches to
amend any errors that may be in them.</p>

<p>The relative section of the second edition of Burg’s “<i>Drawing of
Artillery Material</i>” is to be taken as the basis for these exercises.
In addition to them, the students receive guidance and suitable
instruction in drawing artillery objects off-hand by the eye, without
the use of instruments. The first two days are to be chosen for this,
and the students by this use of off-hand drawing receive at the same
time a useful preparation for the drawings subsequently required to be
taken by the aid of instruments.</p>


<p class = "heading">D. <i>Exercises necessary in regard to
Sieges</i>&mdash;</p>

<p>Are to be conducted by the teacher of artillery and special
engineering jointly, and are given more in detail under <i>exercises in
fortification</i>.</p>


<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page388" id = "page388">388</a></span>
<p class = "heading">III. <span class = "smallroman">EXERCISES IN COMMON
OF THE FIRST AND SECOND CŒTUS.</span></p>

<p class = "heading">A. <i>Proof of Powder.</i></p>

<p>This exercise is to be conducted by all the students of the first and
second cœtus at the time of the gun-practice, and comprises&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Firing different sorts of powder from the proof mortar.</p>

<p>2. Firing different sorts of powder purposely brought into an
abnormal state.</p>

<p>3. Instruction in weighing and measuring the powder.</p>


<p class = "heading">B. <i>Artillery Practice.</i></p>

<p>All the students of the second and third cœtus take part in the
practice under the inspection of the two teachers of artillery, for
which fourteen days in August and September are fixed. If possible, it
is to be undertaken in the morning, and only when the practice-ground is
otherwise occupied is it to be deferred till the afternoons.</p>

<p>The practice comprises&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The necessary preparation for firing; namely, laying down the
platform, marking the range, fixing the targets, preparing the lists to
note the shots.</p>

<p>2. Firing from different kinds of ordnance and with different
projectiles.</p>

<p>3. Instruction of the students in the service of the guns; selection
of the charge and direction under given circumstances, and their
correction; effects of distance; noting and jotting down the shots and
the time of flight; calculation of the length of fuse, of ranges and
averages from the different data, and remarks on the effects sought.</p>

<p>4. Burning a portion of prepared laboratory materials for observation
of its action and effect.</p>

<p>The following are to be objects of practice:&mdash;</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p><i>a.</i> Rounds of six, twelve, and twenty-four lbs. shot and shell
out of the short 24-pounders, to note&mdash;</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p><i>aa.</i> The grazes, distances, and deviations at different
elevations, and as regards ricochet fire.</p>

<p><i>bb.</i> Probability of hitting upright targets at various
distances.</p>

<p><i>cc.</i> As regards dismounting.</p>

<p><i>dd.</i> As regards firing against heads of saps.</p>
</div>

<p><i>b.</i> Seven, ten and twenty-five lb. shells, carcases, and light
balls, to note&mdash;</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p><i>aa.</i> The grazes, distances, and deviations at different
elevations and charges, also as regards ricochet firing.</p>

<p><i>bb.</i> The probability of hitting upright targets at various
distances.</p>
</div>

<p><i>c.</i> Shells, carcases, and light balls from mortars, to
note&mdash;</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p><i>aa.</i> The probability of hitting upright targets at different
distances.</p>

<p><i>bb.</i> The calculation of the charge or elevation when one of
these elements and the distance are given, or <i>vice versâ</i>.</p>

<p><i>cc.</i> Calculation of lengths of fuse for given distances.</p>
</div>

<p><i>d.</i> Throwing hand grenades, stones, 1-pound case shot, and
3-pound balls at various distances for comparison of the effects.</p>

<p><i>e.</i> Firing from the hand and stock-mortars at differing
distances.</p>

<p><i>f.</i> Case shot from 6 or 12-pounders, also from short or long
24-pounders and 7 and 50-pound howitzers at different distances against
planks, and both with case shot, and grape shot, for observing the
effect:</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page389" id = "page389">389</a></span>
<p><i>aa.</i> Of different charges.</p>

<p><i>bb.</i> Of different weights of the entire case.</p>

<p><i>cc.</i> Of the weight and size of balls used.</p>

<p><i>dd.</i> There is also to be observed the scattering, the number of
hits and wide balls, and determination of the best line.</p>

<p><i>g.</i> Shrapnel shells from field-pieces against planking.</p>
</div>

<p>5. The number of the before-named rounds is not to be too great,
partly not to increase expense, partly in regard to time, since the
practice is intended for instruction, and therefore not to be hurried.
Still for shot, shell, and grape shot, ten rounds is the <i>minimum</i>,
if a result is to be drawn; for the small mortar five rounds are
sufficient.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this limit, it will not be possible to take the
practice all in one year. It seems, therefore, expedient to divide the
whole into two portions, so that the most important practice happens
indeed in each year, generally however, in one year the practice is to
take place with field-pieces, in the following year with siege-pieces,
so that the student who is present once in the first year and once in
the second can complete the necessary course.</p>

<p>The teachers have, therefore, to determine, in the proposed plans for
these exercises, the sort and number of rounds they judge necessary for
the following year.</p>


<p class = "heading">C. <i>Practice in the Laboratory.</i></p>

<p>As the students of the artillery, by the present regulations of their
education in the regiments, have not sufficient opportunity to learn the
service of the laboratory perfectly, particular attention must be paid
to this work in the school.</p>

<p>The students of the engineer corps also take part in it, in the
second cœtus, not to become perfect proficients in the different
operations, but so as to gain a general knowledge of ammunition,
matches, and compositions, and the duties of the laboratory.</p>

<p>All the students of the first, and the artillery students of the
second cœtus are therefore to be occupied by their teachers for twelve
afternoons in the laboratory.</p>

<p>For the superintendence, so necessary in these works, and for variety
of practice, the fireworkers employed as assistant teachers in the
school, and others from the proof department of the artillery, and also
five or six artillery officers of the third cœtus, are to be present at
this practice, so that each of these students is present twice or thrice
on the average.</p>

<p>The work embraces, first, the preparation of ammunition for the
artillery practice, &amp;c.</p>

<p>But as this would not suffice for the complete instruction of such a
large number of students, it must receive an extension calculated for
this purpose, and embrace not only the separate preparations, but also a
large quantity of ammunition, which, as not required for the school, is
therefore sent to the depót.</p>

<p>The following work is to be preferred:&mdash;</p>

<p>Pounding of saltpetre, grinding meal powder, pounding sulphur and
charcoal, boiling paste, making mastic, composition, quick-match, fuses,
tubes, port-fires, carcass composition, touchpaper, case and grape shot,
loading shells for bursting, discharging empty shells in which a fuse
only has been driven; carcasses, fire-balls, and light balls; infantry,
cavalry, buck-shot, and percussion
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page390" id = "page390">390</a></span>
cartridges; ball, canister, howitzer, and paper cartridges. Fanal,
signal rockets, pitch compounds, powder bags, and stink-pots. The
teacher is to make a careful distribution of the students, (allowing for
such as have missed any days by illness,) to be satisfied that each
artillerist has made every article in the laboratory, if possible, or at
least has carefully witnessed its preparation.</p>

<p class = "heading">IV. <span class = "smallroman">EXERCISES IN THE
THIRD CŒTUS.</span></p>

<p>All the exercises of this cœtus take place during the period of the
theoretical course.</p>

<p class = "heading">A. <i>Visit to the Workshops.</i></p>

<p>The student will have to learn the mode of proceeding, the
construction, and the use of the machines employed. Examination and
storing of the most important raw materials.</p>

<p class = "heading">B. <i>Visit to the Iron Foundry.</i></p>

<p>All the students of the third cœtus are to be divided into two
sections, and each section to be conducted on an afternoon under the
care of the teacher of artillery concerned to the Royal Iron
Foundry.</p>

<p>They will see there the molding, casting, and cleaning of case shot,
cannon balls, and shells.</p>

<p>They will also have explained to them the construction of
reverberatory and cupola furnaces, of steam engines, and of turning
lathes, and planing benches.</p>

<p class = "heading">C. <i>Visit to the Foundry and Boring
Machine.</i></p>

<p>The students of the third cœtus are to be present at the actual
manufacture of cannon, their molding, casting, and boring. But as the
circumscribed room and other considerations will not allow all the
students to be present at one time, different divisions are to be
formed, to visit the foundry and boring house on different days. The
teacher concerned, will, therefore, make the necessary inquiries as to
the time when the above works are going on, and arrange the visits by
communication with the director.</p>

<p>The casting and preparation of iron ordnance require particular
attention. On this, too, the teacher has to obtain information, and
proceed as above.</p>

<p class = "heading">D. <i>Examination of Iron Ammunition.</i></p>

<p>The artillery officers of the third cœtus take these exercises in
hand on two afternoons, under care of the artillery teacher in the same
cœtus.</p>

<p>The purport of it is not so much a thorough instruction in this
manufacture, as a completion of the theoretical lectures on the mode of
conducting the processes by means of personal inspection and handling of
the instruments. The teacher will pay particular attention to the errors
that may occur in the measurements, &amp;c.</p>

<p class = "heading">E. <i>Examination of Cannon.</i></p>

<p>This exercise is to be undertaken by the artillery officers of the
third cœtus, under the inspection of their artillery teacher, in six
afternoons. The object of it is exactly the same as of the
foregoing.</p>

<p>The exercise must commence with directions for proving the
instruments, when the teacher will show the mode of their
manipulation.</p>

<p>As the use of such instruments only can be reckoned on as the school,
the depôt, and the artillery proof department possess, only three
sections of the
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page391" id = "page391">391</a></span>
students can work each day simultaneously; the section consisting, at
the utmost, of six persons, if individual handling of them is presumed
necessary.</p>

<p>The teacher must, therefore, divide the students into sub-sections,
and make such arrangement that each student, if possible, personally
work every part of the exercise, or at least have a perfect sight of
it.</p>

<p>That portion of the students which can not be immediately occupied on
each exercise day, put their tables of dimensions in the order and forms
required by the regulations.</p>


<p class = "heading">F. <i>Examination of the Gun-Carriages and
Wagons.</i></p>

<p>The exercise is to be conducted by the artillery officers of the
third cœtus, exactly as the foregoing, in five afternoons.</p>


<p class = "heading">G. <i>Practical Exposition of the Rules for the
placing of Guns according to given Tactical Relations.</i></p>

<p>These exercises are to be performed by the artillery students of the
third cœtus, under the direction of their teacher of artillery, on four
afternoons.</p>

<p>The teacher makes known the ground by means of a plan; he then
directs reconnaissances to be made, and receives the reports.</p>

<p>He selects a tactical problem, the nature of which offers opportunity
to remark both on the placing of guns of different calibres, and also
the reserve artillery at the decisive moment of a battle, as well as the
more minute details of placing single divisions and guns, and the
limbers, riding horses, and wagons.</p>

<p>Before he solves himself the problem completely, he gathers the
opinions of the students in respect to single portions, and if necessary
sets them right.</p>

<p>The principles to be followed refer so specially to the ground, that
the object of illustrating the instructions can be attained without
guns. The teacher may therefore content himself with marking by flags
the situation of single guns and batteries, by which the advantage is
obtained of an easier use of the ground.</p>


<p class = "heading">H. <i>Exercises at Spandau in reference to a
Siege.</i></p>

<p>These exercises are to be conducted by the teacher of artillery, in
unison with analogous regulations of the teacher of engineering, and are
more particularly mentioned in the practical exercises of
fortification.</p>

<p>The limits of time and means render it impossible to gain for the
above-named exercises that extent by which the full acquirement of the
necessary mechanical readiness could be insured. It is sufficient if the
student has made a perfect personal examination and performed as much
manipulation as circumstances permit.</p>

<p>The separate practical exercises can only be made after the
termination of the theoretical treatment of the subject. This rule is
necessary, partly because this practice is only a continuance and
completion of the lecture, partly because the shortness of time
restricts the exercises considerably, and therefore the days devoted to
them can not be applied to theoretical explanations, which will be more
profitably given in the lectures.</p>

<p>Where the nature of the exercises permits, the officers and elder
<i>portépée ensigns</i> will take the superintendence, that having
formerly learnt the execution, they may now make themselves acquainted
with the duties of ordering and inspection.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page392" id = "page392">392</a></span>
<p>The number of students engaged at one time in an exercise ought not
to be so large that a portion of it remain unoccupied or not under the
complete inspection of the teacher. The disturbances that occur too
easily in such cases, being most injurious, must be most carefully
avoided. The teacher will make the division above stated, and take all
necessary measures for obtaining the requisite control.</p>

<p>If at any of the exercises, danger can arise to the students, the
teacher is previously to instruct them specially in what is to be
observed for the safety of the workmen; after that, the superintendence
of the students must be conducted with increased care, and any departure
from the given orders visited with redoubled severity.</p>

<p>The determination of the days for these exercises rests with the
director, after consulting the teachers. Should unexpected hindrances
prevent the carrying out an exercise, the teacher may determine
concerning it, but must consult with the Direction as to the fetching it
up on another disposable day.</p>

<p>The necessary workmen will be demanded by the Direction from the
respective services, of which the teacher will give to the Direction due
previous notice.</p>

<p>The guns necessary for practice are to be lent by the Artillery
Regiment of the Guard and the Artillery Depot; all the other
instruments, equipments, &amp;c., are borrowed from the Depot. All
materials are received by order of the war department or by purchase. It
is therefore the business of the senior of the two Artillery teachers,
in his yearly demand for the practice, to state the full requirement of
tools and materials, that the Direction may take timely measures for
their supply.</p>


<h5><a name = "prussia_berlin_fort" id = "prussia_berlin_fort" href =
"#prussia_berlin_subjects">VIII. PRACTICAL EXERCISES IN
FORTIFICATION.</a></h5>

<p>Practical exercises in fortification stand in immediate relation to
the lectures on fortification, sieges, and field engineering. They
complete, as far as possible under given circumstances, the theoretical
lectures by personal view; they also offer the students opportunity for
solving fitly chosen problems, to apply what has been learnt, and to
prepare by reflection for practical service.</p>

<p>The exercises are to be conducted in each cœtus by the teachers who
lecture on Engineering. The presence of the Artillery teacher is
elsewhere separately noted.</p>


<p class = "heading">A. <span class = "smallroman">THE EXERCISES
COMPRISE&mdash;</span></p>

<p class = "heading">a. <i>For the First Cœtus.</i></p>

<p>1. In unison with the teacher of Artillery and of General
Engineering, the examination of the fortress of Spandau, to make clear
to the students the combination of the details of a complete fortress
from an actual example.</p>

<p>2. Examination of the models of fortresses and their details in the
Arsenal, to make clear the principles of a siege.</p>

<p>3. Visiting the exercising-ground of the Engineer division of the

<p class = "heading">b. <i>For the Second Cœtus.</i></p>

<p>1. Examining the models in the model-house, partly to illustrate the
systems taught, partly to show the influence of ground on the situation,
form, and contrivance of the works; and again to explain by the aid of
the necessary notices of the sieges of these fortresses the choice of
the fronts of attack, and other matters relating to sieges.</p>

<p>2. Problems on the ground for sieges, such as may happen, to a
subaltern officer, as simple as possible, but to be solved clearly and
exactly.</p>

<p>These exercises refer principally to the marking out of parallels,
zig-zags, and saps, as well as marking out and tracing siege batteries.
They are to be undertaken under the united direction of the teachers of
Special Engineering and of Artillery on the exercise ground of the Guard
Engineer division.</p>

<p><ins class = "correction" title = "text has ‘8’">3</ins>. Problems on
field fortification, not too comprehensively drawn out, but of which the
solution should be the more complete. Here belong, <i>e.g.</i>, the
fortifying of a house, a farmstead, a bridge, or other defile, covering
of an advanced post, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>


<p class = "heading">c. <i>For the Third Cœtus.</i></p>

<p>The days of the calendar for these exercises are to be proposed by
the teachers when delivering in their annual sketch of exercises, and
their propositions will be laid by the Direction before the authorities
for their approval.</p>

<p>To engage the pupils to work they are to be divided for the visits
and exercises into suitable sections. Each section receives its problem
from the teacher, who also nominates the president of the section. This
president distributes the sub-sections among the other students, and
sees that the work to be written and drawn is finished in the required
time, signed by the author, and is delivered by him to the teacher.
Great care is to be taken that single students do not remain unoccupied;
the disturbances thence only too likely to arise are always injurious to
the instruction and the discipline. In giving out problems, their
principal conditions only are to be designated by the teacher, and the
development left entirely to the student, or with little aid from the
teacher, in order that the student may gain early that confidence and
independence necessary to the soldier in carrying out matters committed
to his charge.</p>

<p>In the exercises the workmen demanded for marking out, are to be
limited as much as possible, as the students must perform the greatest
part of the work themselves. The number indispensably necessary will be
demanded in time by the teacher from the Guard Engineer Division through
the Direction.</p>

<p>The necessary material, if the Guard Engineer Division can not
furnish it as a loan, may be purchased at the charge of the school.</p>

<p class = "smallhead">BY GENERAL VON HOPENER.</p>

<p class = "smallhead">I. OBJECT, PLAN AND STAFF OF THE INSTITUTION.</p>

<p><span class = "firstword">The</span> War School
(<i>Kriegs-Schule</i>) is intended to receive officers of all arms, who
during three years of active service have given proof of ability and of
particular capacity. They find there the means for acquiring the
knowledge requisite for the higher ranks of the service, for the duties
of officers of the staff, and for all other appointments which demand
military and scientific studies of a higher and more general character
than the common ones.</p>

<p>The course of study is for three years, and is divided amongst three
classes. The courses begin on the 1st of October, and continue to the
1st of July. The number of officers who can be received is 120, neither
room nor means of instruction sufficing for more. The three months of
vacation in the summer are employed by the pupils in learning the
service of those arms of the profession to which they do not belong.</p>

<p>The Special Direction of the War School consists,&mdash;</p>

<div class = "inlist">
<p>(<i>a</i>) Of the Military Direction.</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) Of the Direction of Studies.</p>
</div>

<p>The Military Direction consists of a director, a field officer
connected with the direction as inspector, and an adjutant, who directs
the accounts of the Institution.</p>

<p>The military director is supreme, both over the military officers who
are members of direction, and of the military officers who are studying
in the school. The police, the discipline, and all the administration of
the Institution are under his control. All the subordinate officers in
the house are under his orders. The field officer attached to him is
charged to look carefully to the discipline and to the due attendance at
the lectures. The adjutant directs the correspondence and accounts of
the establishment. The whole of the staff and the military directors are
lodged in the school.</p>

<p>The Direction of Studies is in the hands of three field officers of
literary and scientific attainments, and of two other persons, civilians
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page396" id = "page396">396</a></span>
of Berlin, of high literary reputation. Its president is the senior
officer, who is generally also the military director. It has also a
secretary attached to it.</p>

<p>The Direction or Board of Studies is exclusively intrusted with the
care of everything affecting the teaching of the Institution, and its
members are bound to be frequently present at the lectures. It has also
under its inspection all the means and objects required for teaching,
such as the library, the collection of maps and models, the collections
for physical science, and the laboratory.</p>

<p>The Director of Studies selects the professors of the Institution,
recommends them to the superior authorities, and in case of their
appointment gives them their instructions.</p>

<p>At the beginning of each course the direction fixes the plan of the
lectures, and if any alterations in them are required, proposes them to
the superior authorities for their sanction.</p>

<p>The Direction of Studies regulates the examinations which the
officers who are candidates for admission into the school are to
undergo. With this view it draws up a certain number of subjects and
questions suited for the purpose, which it sends, in the spring of each
year, to the chiefs of the staff of the different Corps d’Armée, in
whose presence the candidates do their work. Those of the candidates
whose work is satisfactory are entered at once in the school.</p>

<p>In order to take account of the progress of the students the board of
studies makes them pass an examination in writing at the end of every
three months; makes a revision of the judgment of the professors upon
the papers, and conjointly with the military board of direction, gives
certificates at the end of the triennial course to the officers who have
gone through it completely. In these studies it is the part of the board
of studies to give a judgment on the scientific merit, and that of the
military board to judge the moral conduct of the officers.</p>

<p>The two boards make a report yearly on the progress and the conduct
of the officers of the school. This report is submitted to the king by
the minister of war. Particular mention is made of those officers who by
extraordinary success have deserved his majesty’s favor.</p>


<p class = "smallhead">II. SUBJECTS AND AIDS OF INSTRUCTION.</p>

<p>Attendance on the different courses is partly obligatory, partly
compulsory, with this restriction, however, that every student must
attend twenty lectures a week, given before 12 o’clock, including the
obligatory courses. These last are those of the purely military
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page397" id = "page397">397</a></span>
sciences, and for the first class those of mathematics. As it is
impossible for most of the pupils to give sufficient attention to all
the courses to be examined in them at the end of each three months, they
are allowed to select those of the courses which they may choose to
follow. But this choice once made must be adhered to.</p>

<p>The instruction is divided into theoretical courses and practical
exercises.</p>

<p>The theoretical courses comprehend all the subjects which come within
the object of the Institution. They are the following:&mdash;</p>

<div class = "inlist">
<p>1. Mathematics, a course of three years, six lectures a week, half
employed in statement of the theory, half in the practical
application.</p>

<p>2. The Higher Geodesy, in the third class, three lectures a week.</p>

<p>3. Physical Geography, in the first class, two lectures a week.</p>

<p>4. General Geography, in the first class, four lectures a week.</p>

<p>5. Special Geography, particularly that of the probable theaters of
War for Prussia, in the second class, four lectures a week.</p>

<p>6. Universal History, in the first and second class, four lectures a
week in each.</p>

<p>7. General History of Literature, in the third class, four lectures a
week.</p>

<p>8. Logic, in the second class, four lectures a week.</p>

<p>9. Physical Science, in the second class, four lectures a week.</p>

<p>10. Chemistry, in the third class, four lectures a week.</p>

<p>11. Physiology of the Horse, in the second class, two lectures a
week.</p>

<p>12. Tactics, in the first and second classes, four lectures a week in
each.</p>

<p>13. Artillery, in the first class, three lectures a week.</p>

<p>14. Fortification, a course of three years in the three classes. In
the first class, Field Fortification; in the second, Permanent
Fortification; in the third, the Conduct of Sieges; two lectures a week
in each class.</p>

<p>15. Military Administration, in the first class, two lectures a
week.</p>

<p>16. Military History, in the third class, seven lectures a week.</p>

<p>17. Duties of the Staff, in the third class, three lectures a
week.</p>

<p>18. Military Law, in the third class, one lecture a week.</p>

<p>All these lectures are given in the morning, between eight and one
o’clock.</p>

<p>19. The French Language, a course of three years in different
classes; into each of which the pupils enter according to the knowledge
they possess of the language; six lectures a week for each class.</p>

<p>20. The Russian Language, four lectures a week.</p>

<p>The above two courses are in the afternoon.</p>
</div>

<p>The practical work is done after the end of the courses of the second
and third classes. They consist in making the officers draw plans for
military objects, make sketches of ground.</p>

<p>These exercises are completed by a journey of fifteen days under the
conduct of an officer of the staff, in order to teach the service of an
officer of the staff in the country.</p>

<p>The instruments of teaching consist of&mdash;</p>

<p>1. A library for the use of professors and students, and a collection
of maps and plans, all under the charge of a librarian living within the
school.</p>

<p>2. A collection of models for the courses of artillery and
fortification, under the care of a commissary of the school.</p>
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page398" id = "page398">398</a></span>

<p>3. A cabinet of physical science, under the direction of a professor
lodged in the house.</p>

<p>4. A laboratory and chemical apparatus, under the direction of a
professor of chemistry.</p>

<p>There are no manuals specially used for the instruction.</p>

<p>For the courses of geography and of the history of war, the direction
furnishes the pupils with the plans and maps required, as far as the
means of the Institution allow it, or it procures them at moderate
prices, to be repaid by instalments.</p>


<p class = "smallhead">PROFESSORS AND STUDENTS.</p>

<p>The officers acting as professors in the school are officers of
mature age, and high education, chosen from the garrison of Berlin. The
teacher of the duties of the staff, must always belong to this corps.
They are appointed to their work in the school for an indefinite time,
without prejudice to their other duties.</p>

<p>The civil professors are generally chosen from those of the Royal
University at Berlin.</p>

<p>With regard to discipline, all the professors are subject to the
board of military direction; with regard to teaching, to the board of
direction of studies.</p>

<p>Every professor is bound upon entering on his functions to lay before
the board of direction of studies a programme stating the bearing, the
successive subjects, and the arrangement of his course. This programme
must be approved by the direction.</p>

<p>The payment of professors is fixed according to the number of their
weekly lectures. It is less for the professors of Language, as they
require less time to prepare their lectures.</p>

<p>The students of the school are under the immediate authority of the
military direction; but they are ordered to look upon the professors,
whilst engaged in their duties, as their superiors, so that offences
against them are subject to military law.</p>

<p>Permission to follow the courses of the school involves for every
officer the obligation to serve two years in the army for every year
passed in the school.</p>

<p>Although the complete course is for three years, officers do not
always continue it for more than one year. At the end of the year those
only are allowed to return who have shown themselves deserving of this
favor. Students lose the right of continuing their studies who neglect
their lectures, or show indifference and a want of interest in their
work, who come often too late, avoid the duties imposed upon them, or
endeavor to escape their examinations.</p>

<p>The Prussian Staff (<i>Generalstab</i>) which has been completely
reorganized since the war of 1866, subserves the double purpose of
providing staff officers for the duties of the active army, and of
collecting and arranging the statistical, geographical, and historical
information necessary for the operations of war; further, it is the
school in which young officers temporarily detached from their
regiments, after a course of instruction at the Military Academy, have
their qualifications tested before admittance to this branch of the
army, and the principal office of the trigonometrical survey of the
Eastern Provinces.</p>

<p>The head-quarters of this organization are at Berlin, where a large
building is appropriated to the various offices and departments, in
which the chief of the staff, General von Moltke, resides. It has two
establishments:&mdash;</p>

<p>(<i>b.</i>) The general staff, or <i>grosser Generalstab</i>.</p>
</div>

<p><i>B.</i> The accessory <i>état, neben Etat</i>.</p>
</div>

<p>2. The war establishment.</p>

<p>The staff of the commands is so complete during peace as to require a
very unimportant augmentation, and that chiefly in the lower grades, on
the outbreak of war; the framework not only exists, but the officers
comprising it are already acquainted with the generals under whom they
serve, and with the officers and troops with whom they have to
communicate.</p>

<p>At the head-quarters of each corps there are: a chief of the
staff&mdash;sometimes a Major-General, more frequently a Colonel,
exceptionally a Lieutenant-Colonel&mdash;a field officer, and a captain;
at that of each division a field officer; there is also a chief of the
staff with the General Inspection of the artillery. The subordinate
duties are performed by the aides-de-camp, of whom there are two at the
head-quarters of each corps, and one with each division and brigade; but
these officers are not included in the establishments of the general
staff, and wear the uniform of their respective regiments; are in no
sense of the word aides-de-camp as existing in the English army; they
bear the designation of <i>Adjutant</i>, and may more properly be
compared to our Deputy Assistants and Brigade Majors: indeed the
solitary Adjutant is the only assistant to the Major-General in the
performance of the brigade duties. In the time of war the staff is
further supplemented by <i>Ordonanz Offiziere</i> attached as aids to
the general officers in command.</p>

<p>The <i>Grosser Generalstab</i> includes the officers of the staff who
are not employed with the commands, and is stationed in Berlin under the
personal direction of the chief of the staff. The <i>Neben</i> or
<i>accessory Etat</i> includes the officers employed in the strictly
scientific work allotted to this department.</p>

<p>The combined staff at head-quarters is subdivided as follows:</p>

<div class = "inlist">
<p><i>a.</i> The three Sections;</p>
<p><i>b.</i> The section for military history;</p>
<p><i>c.</i> Trigonometrical section;</p>
<p><i>d.</i> Topographical section;</p>
<p><i>e.</i> Geographical-statistical section;</p>
<p><i>f.</i> The map-room.</p>
</div>

<p>The three sections have the object of collecting and arranging
information respecting the home and foreign armies. The home subjects to
be treated are
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page400" id = "page400">400</a></span>
the means and warlike institutions of the State, its fortresses,
magazines, ports, inland communications, the organization, recruiting,
mobilization, armament, equipment, and drill of the army. The warlike
systems of foreign nations, the strength and organization of their
armies, regulations, and drill, the distribution of the troops, state of
preparation for active service, and their systems of reinforcement and
reserves, are the further subjects of inquiry. For these purposes the
work is divided as follows, according to the division into&mdash;</p>

<p><i>1st Section.</i>&mdash;Austria, Russia, Sweden and Norway,
Denmark, Turkish Empire, Greece, Asia.</p>

<p><i>2d Section.</i>&mdash;Prussia and North Germany, South Germany,
Italy, Switzerland.</p>

<p><i>3d Section.</i>&mdash;France, Great Britain, Belgium, the
Netherlands, Spain, Portugal, America.</p>

<p>The number of officers actually belonging to the two categories of
principal and accessory establishments of the staff is 115, of whom 94
belong to the first, and 21 to the second named branch. In the first
there are 17 chiefs of the staff&mdash;viz., 13 with the army corps, one
with the General Inspection of the artillery, and three at the head of
the three sections&mdash;47 field officers, and 29 captains. In the
accessory establishment there are four chiefs, five field officers, and
12 captains.</p>

<p>The office establishment, inclusive of the Engineer
geographers&mdash;who are non-commissioned officers of the Artillery or
Engineers serving permanently in the trigonometrical section in place of
the officers who were till recently employed temporarily in this office,
and of whom there are at present 10&mdash;consists of 18 permanent
officials, not including a head messenger, two chancery servants, two
house servants, and a porter.</p>

<p>The supernumeraries comprise 40 officers attached for a year, 20 for
duty with the staff generally, the remainder for surveying; 34 surveyors
who are only employed during about five months in each year, and 41
draughtsmen.</p>

<p>The pay of the permanent staff amounts to 206,150 thalers, or
30,922<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i>, the material expenses being 62,250 thalers,
or 9,339<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i> Of this latter sum about two-thirds is
required for office and surveying expenses; 17,000 thalers, or
2,550<i>l.</i>, are allowed for the annual journeys of instruction
undertaken by the staff, and 3,000 thalers, or 450<i>l.</i>, for
allowances to officers traveling for scientific or professional
purposes.</p>

<p>The actual sum disbursed for office and surveying purposes is 47,450
thalers, or 7,417<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i>, of which 7,000 thalers, or
1,050<i>l.</i>, are recovered by the sale of maps and works published by
the staff, 2,000 thalers, or 300<i>l.</i>, being derived from the
profits of the bi-weekly military paper, “<i>Militair Wochen
Blatt</i>.”</p>

<p>Besides the duties already mentioned, the staff at head-quarters
undertakes:</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>1. The training of officers for staff purposes. To this end young
officers who have passed the prescribed three years at the Military
Academy, “<i>Kriegs Akademie</i>,” are attached for a year to the
different sections, where they are required to draw up reports on
strategical and tactical questions, critical reports on the military
events of past eras, descriptions of the ground embraced in military
operations, and of the military organization of foreign countries. These
essays, when of special value, are laid before the chief of the
staff.</p>

<p>2. The preparation of printed reports on foreign armies, which are
distributed to the staff officers employed elsewhere.</p>

<p>3. The contribution of papers on professional subjects to the
“<i><ins class = "correction"
title = "spelling unchanged">Militair</ins> Wochen Blatt</i>,” or military paper.</p>
</div>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page401" id = "page401">401</a></span>
<p>This publication, which appears twice a week, was formerly edited in
the office of the staff, but has lately been in the hands of a
responsible editor, a colonel on half-pay, who stands, however, in
intimate connection with the office. The contribution required from the
staff is twenty sheets of printed matter annually from the various
departments, a much larger amount being furnished, from which the chief
selects what he considers suitable for publication.</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>4. Military tours of instruction, for which a sum of 2,550<i>l.</i>
is annually granted.</p>
</div>

<p>All the officers who can be spared from the duties of the office take
part in these tours, as also a few staff officers called in from the
commands, and a selection from the commanders of regiments.</p>

<p>They are also made on a smaller scale by the staff of the Corps,
augmented by regimental officers attached for instruction, under the
superintendence of the respective chiefs of the staff.</p>

<p>For the tour superintended by General Von Moltke, the theatre of
operations and certain conditions likely to influence them are
indicated, a supposed strength is given to two opposing armies, their
depots and means of reinforcement are clearly laid down, and the
influence likely to be exerted by the movements of other armies or
bodies of troops on their flanks are taken into calculation. According
to these data the senior officers present make their plans of manœuvre,
employing their juniors in the preparation of all the subordinate
arrangements, the movements of the troops, the selection of positions
for attack or defense, the arrangements for supply, and for retaining a
communication with the base. All these measures are carried out on the
spot, and daily reports are made to the superintending officer, which,
when necessary, are accompanied by such rough sketches as are usual
during the progress of a campaign.</p>

<p>From these materials he is enabled to form an idea in what degree the
spirit of the operations has been grasped by the directing officers, and
in how far their juniors are instructed in the details of duties which
they may hereafter be called on to perform.</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>5. A large share in the military education of the army generally, by
taking part in the lectures given in the various educational
establishments, and by acting as members of the commissions of
examination and of studies.</p>

<p>6. Officers of the head-quarter staff are also detached to attend the
annual corps manœuvres, those taking place in foreign countries, or the
active campaigns of friendly allied nations.</p>
</div>

<p>Of the three sections into which the head-quarter staff is divided,
the railway department forms part of the second of these sections, the
chief of which selects an officer to preside over and superintend the
working of it, and gather materials on inland and foreign railway
communication. Certain officers are attached permanently, similarly, in
fact, to those belonging to the sections of the accessory establishment,
who have not only to make themselves theoretically masters of their
subject, but by traveling on the various lines acquire practical
acquaintance with the working of railway transport in all its phases.
With a view to diffusing this knowledge as largely as possible, all
officers of the staff have since 1867 been required to attend a six
weeks’ course of study with this branch.</p>

<p>The section of military history has charge of the war archives of the
Prussian army and of the library of the general staff, for additions to
which latter a sum of 1,100 thalers, or 165<i>l.</i>, annually, is
voted.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page402" id = "page402">402</a></span>
<p>The staff of the section is occupied not only with subjects of recent
and immediate interest, but with the study and arrangement of materials
belonging and relating to the wars of earlier date, of which there is a
valuable collection, consisting of reports, day-books, plans, and other
documents, many of them legacies of the prominent actors in the scenes
to which they relate. The library is well supplied with the most
important works in all languages on military history, tactics,
geography, and military science.</p>

<p>The trigonometrical and topographical sections stand in intimate
connection with each other. Since 1865 the former is charged with the
survey of the Eastern Provinces, a work which it is hoped will be
concluded in ten years, under the direction of the chief of the
staff.</p>

<p>Under the present organization there are always forty young officers
attached to the head-quarter staff, but only for one year, their absence
from regimental duty having proved detrimental, while the current work
is naturally better executed when carried out by permanent
<i>employés</i>, thus avoiding the interruption caused by constant
reliefs.</p>

<p>The geographical-statistical is a new section, the necessity for
which arose from the overcrowding of other branches, particularly of the
map-room. So much material had accumulated in the other branches that it
was found necessary to establish a section in which the scattered
information could be condensed in the form of statistics. To this end
the former geographical subsection was altered into its present form
with an enlarged sphere of work, and the charge of the collection of
maps was transferred to it from the map-room, which had become so much
overcrowded with old materials as to have neither room nor time for the
ordinary business of taking charge of the current surveys and of the
maps and charts intended for distribution to the army.</p>

<p>With a view to facilitating the collection of the best geographical
and statistical materials all the sections are placed <i>en rapport</i>
with the new section, to which they are required to forward all special
material coming under notice, and all books or pamphlets which contain
geographical or statistical information. This section stands also in
constant communication with the civil statistical bureau.</p>

<p>The duties of the “<i>Plankammer</i>” (map-room) are now restricted
to the care of the topographical instruments of the original surveys of
the topographical section, of new maps prepared for distribution, and of
the financial business of the general staff. All the scientific duties
of the map-room have passed over to the geographical statistical
section.</p>

<p>There is no regulation on the admission of officers to the staff, nor
is there any direct preliminary examination. They are selected
from:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Those who have completed the prescribed course at the Military
Academy.</p>

<p>2. Those who notify their desire to enter the staff.</p>

<p>3. Those who are recommended by their superiors as officers likely to
become useful staff officers.</p>

<p>The year of probation at head-quarters, already mentioned, affords
the opportunity of forming an opinion as to the capabilities of these
officers, who at its conclusion return to their regiments, where they
are usually employed as adjutants, or, on the occurrence of vacancies,
with the brigades, divisions, or corps.</p>

<h5><a name = "prussia_educ_1" id = "prussia_educ_1" href =
"#prussia_educ_1869">CHANGES SINCE 1856.</a></h5>

<p><span class = "firstword">The</span> following remarks are gathered
from the “Report of the Military Education Commission presented to both
Houses of Parliament,” in 1870, in continuation of the Report submitted
in 1856, on the Systems of Military Education in France, and
Prussia.</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>1. The chief alterations that have taken place in the system of
military education in Prussia since 1856, are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>(<i>a.</i>) All the educational establishments have been very much
enlarged, owing to the increase in the army which has taken place since
1866.</p>

<p>(<i>b.</i>) The educational requirements for a commission remain in
principle the same as they were&mdash;the double examination for the
rank of officer, and the exaction from every candidate for a commission
of proof of both general and professional knowledge being still the
peculiar feature of Prussian military education. There has been,
however, a constant tendency to raise the standard of the preliminary
examination in subjects of general knowledge, and to insist more
strongly upon a sound liberal education as a condition of obtaining a
commission. The number of <i>Abiturienten</i>, or men who have passed
through the complete course at a public school, entering the army
annually is now four times as great as it was in 1856, and there is the
strongest wish still further to increase their number.</p>

<p>(<i>c.</i>) The Cadet Schools in their general character are
unaltered; the introduction of the peculiar class of the Ober-prima in
the Upper Cadet School at Berlin is the most important modification made
in their organization. The proportion of officers supplied by the Cadet
Schools continues much the same as it was in 1856. The feeling in the
army, however, against preparatory military schools appears to be
increasing; a strong opinion is entertained as to the narrowing effects
upon the mind of exclusive class education; and a preference is very
generally exhibited for officers who have had the ordinary education of
civil schools. At the War Schools (<i>Diossi, on Schools in 1856</i>),
the Artillery and Engineer School, and the War Academy (<i>Staff School
in 1856</i>), a decided opinion was expressed as to the intellectual
superiority of the <i>Abiturienten</i> over those who have been educated
in the Cadet Corps.</p>

<p>(<i>d.</i>) The arrangements for the professional instruction of
officers of corps have been very much altered. These officers now have
their education up to the time of obtaining their commissions in common
with candidates for the line; their <i>special</i> instruction does not
commence at the Artillery and Engineer School until they have been in
the service three or four years. For the Artillery, the course at this
school has been reduced to one year, and made strictly practical in
character.</p>

<p>(<i>e.</i>) The course of instruction at the War Academy, or Senior
Department, has been considerably modified; though still comprising many
subjects of an entirely unprofessional character, their number has been
reduced; the attention of the students is more concentrated upon
military studies than formerly, and a larger amount of time is devoted
to practical work. In short, the object has been to render the
instruction less purely theoretical than it formerly was.</p>

<p>(<i>f.</i>) The most important change, however, which has been made
is in regard to the War Schools&mdash;the Schools at which officers of
all arms receive their
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page404" id = "page404">404</a></span>
<i>professional</i> instruction. Since 1856 they have been entirely
re-organized, and placed under the direct control of the Central
Educational Department; a much higher class of teachers are employed;
the character of the instruction has been greatly improved; and
attendance at one of these schools is, with rare exceptions, made
compulsory upon every one before obtaining a commission. These schools
hold a most important position in the Prussian system of military
education, and the greatest pains are bestowed on making them answer the
purpose for which they are intended&mdash;that of giving a thoroughly
practical instruction in military subjects to candidates for
commissions. The improvements made in the War Schools show the greatly
increased importance attached of late years in Prussia to the
professional instruction of officers.</p>
</div>

<p><a name = "prussia_educ_2" id = "prussia_educ_2">2.</a> However
different the French and Prussian systems may be in some respects, they
both agree in this&mdash;that no attempt is made to give a special
military education at an early age, that a general education is made the
ground-work of the professional training, and that at least up to the
age of 17 or 18 the future officer receives the same kind of education
as the civilian, and in the great majority of cases receives it at the
ordinary schools of the country. In Austria, also, the same principle
seems now to have been adopted. The cadet schools in Prussia are no
exception to the rule, for the instruction at them, except in the two
upper classes at Berlin, is the same as at civil schools. The principle
of deferring military education to a comparatively late age is, indeed,
in Prussia carried even to a greater extent than in France, for all
professional instruction is postponed until after the service has been
entered, and regimental duty been performed for nearly a year. The few
who enter the army from the Ober-prima and Selecta of the Cadet Corps
(not amounting to 70 each year) are the only individuals who receive any
military instruction before joining the service, and in their case this
special instruction does not commence until the age of 17.&nbsp;So
strongly is this principle insisted upon, that even for the artillery
and engineers there is no preparatory military education, and the
special instruction of the officers of these arms is not given until
after they have been some years in the service. The idea in Prussia is
that a young man can derive no advantage from studying the <i>theory</i>
of the military profession until he has learnt the <i>practice</i> of
it. “What use can it be,” it was said, “to talk to a lad of the
principles of tactics, when he does not even know the movements of a
battalion, and perhaps has never seen one on parade?”</p>

<p><a name = "prussia_educ_3" id = "prussia_educ_3">3.</a> After,
however, entering the service <i>all</i> the officers of the Prussian
army receive a careful professional instruction&mdash;that given at the
War Schools. The course is of an essentially practical character,
comprising only strictly military subjects, and excluding such studies
as mathematics and even languages.</p>

<p><a name = "prussia_educ_4" id = "prussia_educ_4">4.</a> The officers
of the staff do not necessarily receive any special training previous to
their appointment; but in Prussia this is of less importance, as from
the professional education which every officer has had, those appointed
to the staff, even if they have not passed through the Senior
Department, must at least be acquainted with field sketching and
military regulations, and know something of fortifications and
artillery. Moreover, after appointment, means are taken in the “staff
expeditions” which occur annually, to instruct them in their practical
duties, and (as&nbsp;is the case also in France with the officers of the
Staff Corps) to insure their keeping up the knowledge of field sketching
and reconnaissance which they had previously acquired.</p>

<p><a name = "prussia_educ_5" id = "prussia_educ_5">5.</a> The
connection which exists in Prussia between the military system and the
general education of the country is remarkable.
<i>Portefée-fahnrich</i>, examinations
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page405" id = "page405">405</a></span>
are not only based on the course of instruction at civil schools, but
have been also used as a means of raising the character of the education
given at these schools. On the one hand, the advantages offered to
<i>Abiturienten</i> and to those who have been at a university, indicate
a wish to encourage men of liberal education to enter the army as
officers; on the other hand, by making exemption from the ordinary
period of compulsory service in the ranks dependent (among other
conditions) on educational attainments, the military system has been
employed as an engine for stimulating education among the middle
classes.</p>

<p><a name = "prussia_educ_6" id = "prussia_educ_6">6.</a> The general
management of military education is vested in a single officer, the
Inspector-General. He is assisted by two Boards or Councils, the Board
of Studies in matters connected with the general system of instruction,
and the Supreme Examination Board in regard to the examinations and
qualifications for commissions. The system of education has been still
further centralized since 1856, especially in the case of the War
Schools; and much of the progress that has been made is ascribed to the
unity now given to the whole system of instruction. At the same time
each of the educational institutions has its own Board of Studies,
similar to the <i>conseils d’instruction</i>, at the French schools, who
are charged with the general control of the course of study and with the
duty of making suggestions for its improvement. Several of the
professors, both civil and military, are always members of this Board;
so that the benefit of their practical experience is secured, and the
control of the instruction is never left entirely in the hands of one
man, nor even exclusively of military men. The introduction of the
civilian element into these Boards is deserving of notice; not merely
the professors of the schools, but eminent men connected with the
University of Berlin are employed upon them, and have a voice in
determining the system of military education.</p>

<p><a name = "prussia_educ_7" id = "prussia_educ_7">7.</a> In discipline
the heads of the various schools are almost entirely supreme. At the War
Schools the young men are subject to military law, being already in the
army; at the Cadet Schools this is not the case, but the discipline is
strictly military in character. At both establishments the regulations
are extremely stringent, and the slightest irregularity entails
punishment. But the importance attached to the exercise of moral
influence over the pupils, the personal interest taken in them, and the
kindly relations existing between them and the officers, make the system
of discipline much less rigidly military than it is at the French
schools. Both at the War Schools and the Cadet House, specific
punishments are attached to idleness.</p>

<p><a name = "prussia_educ_8" id = "prussia_educ_8">8.</a> In the
appointment of the heads of the various schools and of the subordinate
officers employed at them, great attention seems to be paid to selecting
individuals fitted for the posts both by educational experience and by
personal qualities. There appears to be rather a general opinion that
the instructors at most of the schools are underpaid, and that this,
combined with the preference frequently given to active military life,
prevents the posts being much sought after by the ablest officers. On
the other hand, however, selection for such appointments is always
regarded as a distinction; and in the Prussian army mere honorary
distinctions, altogether irrespective of material advantages, are held
in much higher estimation than is probably the case in any other
service.</p>

<p><a name = "prussia_educ_9" id = "prussia_educ_9">9.</a> The most
marked point of contrast between the French and Prussian systems of
military education consists in the thoroughly competitive character
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page406" id = "page406">406</a></span>
of the former. In Prussia the principle of competition, though to a
certain extent recognized, is little applied in practice, and never
perhaps fully and strictly carried out. For promotion to the highest
class (the Selecta) of the Berlin Cadet house there is considerable
competition among the pupils, and admission to the War Academy is
obtained by competitive examination open to all the officers of the
army; but even in these two cases personal and other considerations come
more or less into play, and the rewards can not be said to be thrown
open to pure competition. All the other military examinations are simply
qualifying, and there is no attempt to afford the stimulus of publishing
a list of the candidates arranged in order of merit. In fact the term
“competitive examination” scarcely seems to be understood in Prussia.
The pecuniary assistance afforded by the State for the education of boys
in the Cadet Schools is dependent solely on the circumstances and
services of the father, not on the abilities of the candidate
himself.</p>

<p>10. The objections expressed to the further introduction of a
competitive system appear to be universally entertained in the Prussian
army. The object in Prussia seems to be, not to attempt to establish an
accurate <i>comparison</i> of the educational attainments of a number of
individuals, but to form a <i>general estimate</i> of the abilities,
character, and military capacity of each. The army generally are not
considered to be losers by the rejection of the competitive principle;
the system of inspections and of reports from inspecting officers is so
elaborate, and so many checks are provided, that the character and
abilities of individual officers are well known; and appointments,
certainly as a general rule, are said to be made on the ground of real
merit.</p>

<p>11. There appears to be less strictness in enforcing the regulations
connected with military education in Prussia than in France. The
regulations themselves are very stringent, but exceptions are constantly
sanctioned&mdash;for instance, in the length of time which a pupil is
permitted to remain in the same class of the Cadet Schools, in the
number of failures allowed in the various examinations, &amp;c.</p>

<p><a name = "prussia_educ_10" id = "prussia_educ_10">12.</a> The very
great care bestowed upon the method of instruction at all the Prussian
military schools, is extremely remarkable. Individual instructors are
not left to follow out their own ideas of teaching, but careful
regulations are issued for their guidance by the Inspector-General of
Education, to which all are required strictly to conform. The system of
small classes in striking contrast to the French plan of lectures to
large numbers, is a remarkable instance of the anxiety to devote
attention to individual students, and to adapt the instruction to
varieties of ability. But the most remarkable feature of the system of
teaching is the care bestowed upon the higher objects of education, upon
forming and disciplining the mind and encouraging habits of reflection.
The regulations for the instructors at the various schools over and over
again assert that the great object to be kept in view is, not merely to
impart a certain amount of positive knowledge, but to develope the
intellectual faculties and to cultivate powers of thought and reasoning.
The teachers are warned to avoid minute details and barren facts, which
merely burden the memory and are soon forgotten, and to direct attention
to broad principles, which will lay the foundation for further
individual study in after life. With the same object in view, the
examination questions are calculated, not merely to serve as an exercise
of the memory, but to test an intelligent acquaintance with a subject,
and the power of turning knowledge to a useful purpose.</p>

to early military schools. He had found his young nobility excessively
averse to such education. “They shrink from the army,” he said, “because
in this country it is a real training for the character. Nothing is
passed over in a young officer; he is obliged to maintain a prudent,
regular, and sensible conduct. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. This is

<p>It would be impossible to enter on a detailed criticism either of
these lectures or of the essays mentioned in the note above which
evidently imply great study. We invite a comparison with the French
plan, which we have given elsewhere, but the difference of age must be
taken into account. The mathematical course at this school
is,&mdash;</p>

<p class = "continue">1st year. Plane and Spherical Trigonometry,
Quadratic Equations, involving several unknown quantities, the Binomial
Theorem, and the Elements of Analytical and Solid Geometry.</p>

<p class = "continue">2d year. Analytical Geometry and the Differential
and Integral Calculus.</p>

<p class = "continue">3d year. Mechanics, Statics, Dynamics,
Projectiles, and slight Applications.</p>

<p class = "continue">Only the first year is obligatory.</p>
