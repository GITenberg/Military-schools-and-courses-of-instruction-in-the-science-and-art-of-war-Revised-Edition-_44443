SYSTEM AND SCHOOLS IN AUSTRIA.</a></h3>


<h4><a name = "austria_outline" id = "austria_outline" href =
"#austria">I. OUTLINE OF MILITARY SYSTEM.</a></h4>

<p><span class = "firstword">The</span> Austrian Army is recruited by
conscription, the period of service being for eight years, with two
years in addition for the reserve; but such soldiers as wish it may
generally obtain leave after six years’ service. Those who serve eight
years are understood to have a claim for employment on railways and in
the custom-houses. Substitutes are allowed, but they are provided solely
by the State, and the means used for supplying them is made an element
towards securing good Non-Commissioned Officers for the Austrian Army,
in the following manner.</p>

<p>The sum paid over by private individuals for avoiding service in the
Army is £150 (1,500 florins,) and the Government, in providing a
substitute, pays him the <i>interest</i> of this sum during his period
of service, and the <i>capital</i> when it is completed. A&nbsp;good
substitute is permitted to serve twice, and he may thus receive £300
(3,000 florins) when he quits the army. Generally speaking, the
substitutes provided by the Government are good Non-Commissioned
Officers, who by these means are induced to continue a length of time in
the service.</p>

<p>The Officers are obtained during a state of peace, either from the
Military Academies, or by direct entry as Cadets, after passing a slight
examination, into the regiments of infantry and cavalry, in which
capacity they perform the ordinary duties of soldiers, and no particular
period of service is required in this grade. The entry as Cadets is by
nomination, part by the Colonels, proprietors of Regiments; part
consisting of those having claims on the Regiments; and part of those
recommended from the ranks.</p>

<p>Those who join the Army from the Military Academies consist
principally of the sons of military men, whose education is mainly
provided for by the State, and of others who are placed there by means
of funds provided by provinces, districts, municipalities, or private
individuals.</p>

<p>Any Austrian subject has a <i>claim</i> for admittance, on payment of
the annual sum prescribed by the regulations.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page410" id = "page410">410</a></span>
<p>There is no fixed proportion existing between the Infantry and
Cavalry officers supplied from the Military Academies, and those
entering regiments directly as cadets, but it is understood that the
former do not amount to more than one-twentieth or one-thirtieth of the
latter.</p>

<p>The Artillery and Engineers are now entirely supplied with officers
from the Military Academies.</p>

<p>There is no difference in the pay of officers of the same rank in the
various arms in Austria.</p>

<p>Officers when not required are placed on half-pay, which is rather
less than the half of their actual pay whilst serving. When an officer
dies, his widow is not entitled to a pension, but the state provides for
the education of the children; and to prevent distress, an officer is
not permitted to marry unless he has a certain income, independent of
his pay, for the maintenance of his wife.</p>

<p>The promotion in the Infantry and Cavalry is regimental, and usually
by seniority; but there is no doubt that promotion by selection also
takes place, though not in the regiment itself, the officer selected
being promoted into another regiment. The promotion in the Artillery and
Engineers is also by seniority, and by corps, and, until the Hungarian
war, was exceedingly slow.</p>

<p>Although not actually sanctioned by the authorities, cases have
occurred in the Austrian service where officers have purchased steps
from others serving in <i>different</i> regiments to themselves in the
following manner:&mdash;if any officer is about to retire from the
service, the promotion in the regiment being by seniority, the officer
whose turn it would be to obtain the promotion would frequently sell his
right to a junior officer serving in another regiment, who would thus be
promoted into the vacancy. We were informed that this system had
formerly led to frequent duels between the officer obtaining the
promotion, and those officers in the regiment whose prospects were
directly injured, by the senior having sold his promotion, and thus
stopped their advancement.</p>


<h4><a name = "austria_education" id = "austria_education" href =
"#austria">II. OUTLINE OF SYSTEM OF MILITARY EDUCATION.</a></h4>

<p>Military education in Austria has been entirely remodeled since the
Hungarian war, and is now conducted in a very regular and systematic
manner under the sole control and supervision of the Fourth Section of
the Supreme War Department, entitled “Military Schools.”</p>

<p>The establishment consists besides of&mdash;</p>

<div class = "inlist">
<p>2 Majors of Infantry.</p>
<p>1 Captain of Artillery.</p>
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page411" id = "page411">411</a></span>
<p>2 Captains of Infantry.</p>
<p>2 Lieutenants of Infantry.</p>
<p>2 Employés belonging to the Administration.</p>
<p>6 Clerks.</p>
<p>6 Messengers.</p>
</div>

<p>To show the great importance of the Fourth Section, it will only be
necessary to state that the disbursements of the government for Military
Education in Austria for the current year are estimated at £281,440,
(2,814,400 florins,) without taking into consideration the sums
contributed for foundations by provinces, districts, and private
individuals, or of those received for the education of paying students.
This sum of 2,814,400 florins is apportioned in the following
manner&mdash;</p>

<p>From the Bureau of this Section at Vienna all orders for the
management, maintenance, discipline, studies, and regulation of the
various Schools and Academies are issued; and all details relating to
the progress of the several students and the results of their
examinations are periodically sent and regularly examined.</p>

INSTITUTIONS FOR MILITARY EDUCATION.</a><a class = "tag" name = "tag3_1"
id = "tag3_1" href = "#note3_1">1</a></h4>

<p>The Imperial institutions for Military Education, are divided into
Three Classes. They are&mdash;</p>

<div class = "inlist">
<p>A. Such Institutions as are immediately intended for the education of
pupils as Non-commissioned Officers; namely,</p>

<div class = "inlist">
<p>(1.) The Lower Military Houses of Education.</p>
<p>(2.) The Upper Military Houses of Education.</p>
<p>(3.) The School Companies.</p>
</div>

<p>B. Institutions in which it is intended to educate pupils as
Officers; namely,</p>

<div class = "inlist">
<p>(1.) The Cadet Institutions.</p>
<p>(2.) The Military Academies.</p>
</div>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page413" id = "page413">413</a></span>
<p>C. Such Institutions as partly give a special kind of instruction,
and partly complete and carry out the previous education of Officers.
These are&mdash;</p>

<div class = "inlist">
<p>(1.) The Institution for Military Teachers.</p>
<p>(2.) The Higher Course for the Artillery and Engineers.</p>
<p>(3.) The War School.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>In the institutions of the first and second class, education as well
as instruction is given, but those of the third class are limited to
instruction; accordingly, all that is said in the following pages with
regard to the admission of pupils, and with regard to beneficial
foundations, has no reference to institutions of the third class.</p>

<p>Although each of the first-named classes forms a complete whole in
itself, yet they stand in close mutual relation to each other, inasmuch
as the most distinguished pupils of the Lower Houses of Education pass
into the Cadet Institutions; and in the same way the most distinguished
scholars of the Scientific<a class = "tag" name = "tag3_2" id = "tag3_2"
href = "#note3_2">2</a> School Companies, viz., those of the Artillery,
Engineers, Pioneers, Flotilla, and Marine Schools, may be transferred as
attendant pupils<a class = "tag" name = "tag3_3" id = "tag3_3" href =
"#note3_3">3</a> to the Academies; by this means they may obtain a right
to a position in the Army as Officers.</p>

<p>So, on the other hand, insufficient progress may be a reason for
scholars being removed from the Cadet Institutions and the Academies
into the Upper Houses of Education and the School Companies.</p>

<p>By these regulations a road is opened for the advancement of any
talent that may gradually develop itself; and at the same time the
pupils of the Institutions for Higher Military Education are submitted
to that process of elimination which is requisite for the success of
these Institutions.</p>

<p>The pupils in the Institutions for Military Education are either
foundation pupils,<a class = "tag" name = "tag3_4" id = "tag3_4" href =
"#note3_4">4</a> or paying pupils; the first are divided into the
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page414" id = "page414">414</a></span>
military or treasury foundation pupils, and the provincial and private
foundation pupils.</p>

<p>The military or treasury places belong to the army; the claim for
these depends upon the nature of the institution and the position of the
parents. As a general rule, it may be laid down that children of
officers are expected to remain up to eleven years of age under the care
of their parents, whereas those of common soldiers may in the eighth
year of their age be taken under the protection of the State.</p>

<p>The provincial foundations are bestowed upon the sons of the
nobility, or of distinguished <i>employés</i> of the state belonging to
the crown lands of the province. Private foundations are those
established by private individuals or corporations, and the appointment
to these depends upon the conditions laid down by the founder. The
capital or property of these foundations is generally administered by
the Supreme War Department.<a class = "tag" name = "tag3_5" id =
"tag3_5" href = "#note3_5">5</a></p>

<p>Every Austrian subject may claim admission as a paying pupil, if the
other conditions of admission are fulfilled in his case.</p>

<p>In the Lower Houses of Education there are only military or treasury
places.</p>

<p>In the Upper Houses of Education there are 1,800 military places; the
remaining 600 are filled up by pupils upon provincial or private
foundations, and by paying pupils.</p>

<p>In the School Companies the number of the foundation places and
paying places is not fixed.</p>

<p>In the Cadet Institutions and the Academies there are 900 full and
200 half military places, and 520 places for pupils on provincial and
private foundations, and for paying pupils.<a class = "tag" name =
"tag3_6" id = "tag3_6" href = "#note3_6">6</a></p>

<p>A sum to cover the expenses is fixed in the case of the pupils on the
provincial and private foundations, as also for the paying pupils,
amounting in the Houses of Education and in the School Companies to 150
florins (15<i>l.</i>) per annum; in the Cadet Houses to 400 florins
(40<i>l.</i>) per annum; in the Academies 600 florins (60<i>l.</i>) for
each of the three first years, and 800 florins (80<i>l.</i>) for the
last year. These payments will be subject to modifications, at
considerable intervals of time, according to the price of articles of
consumption, and will be drawn in the case of the pupils on the
provincial foundations
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page415" id = "page415">415</a></span>
from the funds of the respective provinces, and in the case of the
pupils of the private foundations, from the moneys belonging to the
private foundations.</p>

<p>The capital for the provincial and private foundations must be duly
secured and sufficient in amount to cover the fixed payments for the
number of places determined upon. Supposing the sum contributed to be
insufficient, the requisite sums must be obtained by deferring any
further nominations.<a class = "tag" name = "tag3_7" id = "tag3_7" href
= "#note3_7">7</a> The proper sums in discharge of these contributions
must be paid in advance, half-yearly, on the 1st of October and the 1st
of April. Those which belong to the provincial foundations, and such
private ones as are administered by trustees, must be paid into the
nearest Military Chest.<a class = "tag" name = "tag3_8" id = "tag3_8"
href = "#note3_8">8</a> In the case of those pupils who pay for
themselves, the money must be sent precisely on the above-mentioned days
to the Commandant, or Director of the School, without reference to the
day on which the pupil may have entered the school. On the other hand,
in cases where a pupil either is removed from or otherwise quits the
institution before the natural time, restitution will be made of the
corresponding proportion of the sum paid in advance.</p>

<p>For admission into a Military Educational Institution, the boy must
first of all be of the age specified for the institution in question,
and must further possess the proper bodily growth and strength
corresponding to that age, and the prescribed amount of knowledge. Every
boy who is to be offered as a candidate for a military place must first
be registered, and this in the course of the same year for which his
admission is desired. This registration must be made by the parents or
guardians through the Commanding Officers of the Army,<a class = "tag"
name = "tag3_9" id = "tag3_9" href = "#note3_9">9</a> or Army-Corps, or
Military Government<a class = "tag" name = "tag3_10" id = "tag3_10" href
= "#note3_10">10</a> within whose district they are domiciled, or in
case of their living in foreign parts, through the Austrian Legation of
the country.</p>

<p>Applications thus made must state what is the institution, admission
into which is desired, and must be accompanied by the following
certificates:&mdash;1.&nbsp;Baptismal certificate. 2.&nbsp;Certificate
of vaccination. 3.&nbsp;Certificate of bodily health, by a Military
Surgeon.
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page416" id = "page416">416</a></span>
4.&nbsp;The school certificate for the last half-yearly examination: And
5.&nbsp;On the reverse the following declaration:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I hereby pledge myself to surrender up my son (<i>or</i> ward) to
the Imperial Military Service, in case of his being admitted into a
Military Educational Institution; and I declare that I will under no
pretext require his return.”</p>

<p>The object of this declaration is, on the one hand, to secure
permanent elements for the Military Educational Institutions, and to
create in the minds of the relations of the candidates the seriousness
of purpose so essential in the choice of a profession. The declaration
will also serve to retain the pupils to a course, which they have
usefully commenced, and to protect them from the consequences of hasty
decisions on the part of their friends. On the other hand, if it appears
manifest that a pupil has not the requisite inclination or qualification
for the military service, his removal from the institution ensues with
or without the request of his friends, as will be more fully explained
further on.</p>

<p>The applications will be examined by the Commanding Officers of the
Army, or the Army Corps, or Military Government, and after their
revision the candidates will be registered and the petitioners duly
informed.</p>

<p>Any changes which occur in the case of the registered candidate, or
in his family circumstances, between the time of registration and of
actual admission, are to be made known to the authorities before whom
the application was brought.</p>

<p>The registers are to be submitted to the Supreme War Department in
the middle of June, so that applications can be received by the
Commanding Officers of the Army, or Army Corps, or Military Government,
at the utmost only up to the end of May.</p>

<p>Appointments to the military places in the Houses of Education and
the School Companies are made by the Supreme War Department; His Majesty
the Emperor reserves for himself those in the Cadet Institutions and the
Academies.</p>

<p>Vacancies in the provincial foundation places are advertised, and
applications called for, by the Governors or by the Standing Committees
of the Estates of the respective provinces.<a class = "tag" name =
"tag3_11" id = "tag3_11" href = "#note3_11">11</a></p>

<p>All proposals made in this manner are forwarded to the Minister
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page417" id = "page417">417</a></span>
of the Interior, and submitted by him for the sanction of His
Majesty.</p>

<p>Appointments to the private foundations are made by the person
specified by the founder; decisions of this kind are submitted on or
before the 15th of June, to the Supreme War Department for their
approval of the candidates and distribution of them into the various
institutions.</p>

<p>If a candidate in whose case the prescribed conditions of admission
are not fulfilled is nominated to a private foundation, and his
nomination consequently not approved, a new nomination must be made.</p>

<p>Pupils who pay are appointed by the Supreme War Department.</p>

<p>The sanction of the appointments and the distribution of the
candidates appointed in the various institutions, in the case of the
military and the paying pupils, will be made known to them by the
Commanding Officers of the Army, or Army Corps, or Military Government;
in the case of the provincial foundations by the Minister of the
Interior; and in the case of the private foundations by the
trustees.</p>

<p>Candidates living in a foreign country will be informed by the
Legation in that country.</p>

<p>Upon the appointment made to an entirely gratuitous place in a
military educational institution, all payments of allowances for the
education of children cease.<a class = "tag" name = "tag3_12" id =
"tag3_12" href = "#note3_12">12</a></p>

<p>The conveyance of military foundation pupils to the school to which
they are appointed will, if not provided for by the friends of the
pupils, be made at the expense of the Military Treasury by the ordinary
means of locomotion.</p>

<p>Trustworthy Non-commissioned Officers from the nearest detachment of
troops should be selected by the military authorities for the conveyance
and charge of the pupils; four or five being, according to the
circumstances, committed to the care of a single superintendent.</p>

<p>The conveyance of all other pupils must be provided for by their
friends.</p>

<p>Admission into the Military Educational Institutions takes place only
at the commencement of the school year. Candidates admitted must present
themselves in their respective institutions between the 15th and the
30th of September.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page418" id = "page418">418</a></span>
<p>The Commanding Officers of the Army, or Army Corps, or Military
Government have to take care that every candidate admitted to a military
place shall, before leaving to join the institution, be a second time
examined by an Army Surgeon, and shall only be allowed to proceed to the
institution in case of his bodily qualifications being found perfectly
sufficient.</p>

<p>Finally, the candidate upon presenting himself must be re-examined by
the chief Medical Officer of the institution, and if he is hereby found
to be unqualified for military education, will not be received.<a class
= "tag" name = "tag3_13" id = "tag3_13" href = "#note3_13">13</a></p>

<p>Any Military Surgeon or Medical Officer who incurs the guilt of
neglect of his duty in this particular will be held responsible.</p>

<p>Every candidate upon presenting himself will moreover undergo the
prescribed examination in his previous studies, and if his previous
education appears insufficient, his appointment will be cancelled.<a
class = "tag" name = "tag3_14" id = "tag3_14" href =
"#note3_14">14</a></p>

<p>Pupils admitted after a private education into a Military Institution
are provided by this institution with new linen, and clothes. All
clothes they bring with them are without exception to be returned to
their friends, and an acknowledgment of the return given.</p>

<p>No pupil in any of the Military Institutions is allowed to possess
any linen or clothes except what is provided; and the friends and
relations are not to be called upon for any sort whatever of additional
contribution. An amount of pocket-money, varying with the character of
the institution, may be transmitted to the pupils through the hands of
the authorities of the school; but this is entirely at the pleasure of
the friends and relations; all necessaries being provided by the
institution.</p>

<p>The pocket-money can only be paid to the pupil through the Commanding
Officer of the Institution or of the Company.</p>

<p>The amount allowed must depend on the conduct of the pupil, but must
not, even in the Academies, exceed three florins (six shillings) a
month.</p>

<p>The course of instruction given in the Military Educational
Institutions is fixed by special tables drawn up for each institution.
Special text-books, to be followed in the courses, are also
appointed.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page419" id = "page419">419</a></span>
<p>The tables drawn up to regulate the course of instruction are subject
to such modifications as may be called for by the requirements of
science and by improvements in the methods of teaching.</p>

<p>The scholars will also receive in the course of the year, more
particularly in summer, and after the close of the examination,
practical instruction suitable to the arm of the service for which they
are destined.</p>

<p>Every September the pupils pass into the next succeeding yearly
course.</p>

<p>In the same month the scholars quit the institutions, and are either
placed in the army or transferred to other institutions. The conditions
under which this is done are given in detail in the account of each
institution.</p>

<p>The expenses of the conveyance of the pupils from one institution to
another are borne by the Treasury.</p>

<p>Pupils who make no progress in scientific studies will be required to
enlist in the army<a class = "tag" name = "tag3_15" id = "tag3_15" href
= "#note3_15">15</a> if old enough, and if not, will be removed to an
inferior Military Educational Institution; or if they are already in one
of the Houses of Education or School Companies, will be employed in
learning some trade which will be of use in the army,<a class = "tag"
name = "tag3_16" id = "tag3_16" href = "#note3_16">16</a> and when they
have reached the proper age, will be enlisted.</p>

<p>Pupils whose want of bodily qualification unfits them for the army
will be sent back to their parents or guardians. Those holding military
places in the Academies, if their parents are entirely unable to provide
for them, will receive a yearly pension of 150 florins (15<i>l.</i>)
until they can be placed in some employment under the State at a salary
at least equivalent to this sum.</p>

<p>Pupils out of the Military Houses of Education or School Companies,
who are removed for want of bodily qualification, and whose parents are
entirely unable to provide for them, will, according to their
capacities, be placed either in the Accounts Department<a class = "tag"
name = "tag3_17" id = "tag3_17" href = "#note3_17">17</a> or some
similar Military Department, in the Geographical Institution, or as
drummers or clerks in one of the higher Military Schools, or will be
taught some trade for employment in the Outfit Department,<a class =
"tag" name = "tag3_18" id = "tag3_18" href = "#note3_18">18</a> or will
be made teachers. If, however, the pupil’s bodily disqualification
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page420" id = "page420">420</a></span>
be of a nature to incapacitate him for any of the above-mentioned
employments, he will be removed at the expense of the Treasury into some
Civil or Military Hospital.<a class = "tag" name = "tag3_19" id =
"tag3_19" href = "#note3_19">19</a></p>

<p>If in moral respects a pupil is found to be a mischievous member of
the institution, he may at any time in the course of any year be
removed.</p>

<p>Pupils who pay, in case of their removal being found, for whatever
reason, necessary, will be sent home to their friends, the consent of
the friends being required before they can be either engaged as soldiers
or removed to one of the lower institutions. The expenses already
incurred will be deducted from the payment made in advance, and the
balance repaid to the parents or guardians.</p>

<p>A pupil who for whatever reason has once been removed from a Military
School can never be afterwards admitted into any one of them, and in
case of his either then or afterwards enlisting in the army, he can not,
under any pretext whatever, obtain the rank of Officer before the pupils
of the year to which he belonged. This rule, in the case of pupils who
have been transferred from a higher to a lower institution, even when
they pass out of this latter in the regular course, must be observed in
reference to the pupils of the year to which they belonged in the
institution from which they were removed.<a class = "tag" name =

Subordinately to these, a lawful claim exists in the following
cases:&mdash;</p>

<div class = "inlist">
<p>1. Sons of soldiers serving in the Trabant Body Guard, the Court
Watch, the Outfit Commission, and other military bodies.<a class = "tag"

however, to sons of soldiers in actual service.</p>

<p>3. Sons of invalided soldiers,<a class = "tag" name = "tag3_26" id =
"tag3_26" href = "#note3_26">26</a> not only in cases where the father
has already married at the date of his reception as invalided, but also
in those where marriage has been subsequently permitted.</p>

<p>4. Sons of those who have either as substitutes or otherwise served
double time, and are now in the employment in connection with the Court
or Government, even in cases where marriage has been contracted after
quitting the service.</p>

<p>5. Sons of men belonging to the military service, not included in the
above-mentioned cases, namely, the sons of Prima-planists,<a class =
"tag" name = "tag3_27" id = "tag3_27" href = "#note3_27">27</a>
Employés, and Officers.</p>
</div>

<p>In any large number of candidates special regard should be had to the
sons of fathers who have been killed or invalided on the field; after
these, to those who are orphans on both sides; then to the sons of
substitutes and other soldiers in actual services; and last follow in
order the sons of fathers either belonging to the Reserve or received as
Invalides, or otherwise connected with the Military Service.</p>

<p>As the sons of Officers serving with the sword<a class = "tag" name =
"tag3_28" id = "tag3_28" href = "#note3_28">28</a> have a large number
of places reserved for their benefit in the Cadet Institutions and the
Academies, their admission into Military Houses of Education, more
especially into the Lower House of Education, is only allowable when no
prejudice is caused to the above-mentioned claimants, and as a general
rule can only take place when they are orphans, or under special
circumstances.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page422" id = "page422">422</a></span>
<p>The age of admission is the completion of the seventh year. Children
under this age who are orphans on both sides, or whose fathers being
widowers, have to serve in the field, will be received into the Orphan
House at Vienna, and be transferred on completing their seventh year to
the Lower Houses of Education. Children who have passed the prescribed
age for admission into the first class of the Lower Houses of Education
can only be admitted, in case of their possessing the requisite amount
of knowledge, into the classes corresponding to their age, and in case
of there being places vacant in these classes; any addition to the
prescribed numbers in the respective years is not allowable.</p>

<p>The number of pupils in each of the Lower Houses of Education is
fixed at 100. These 100 pupils are divided into four years, each year
being as nearly as possible of the same numerical strength.</p>

<p>The command is held by a Subaltern Officer, to whom are attached for
the religious education, the medical care, the discipline, and the
instruction&mdash;</p>

<p>The claim to a military place in an Upper House of Education, is
similar to that for a military place in a Lower House of Education.</p>

<p>The number of pupils is fixed at 200 in each Upper House of

the Cavalry) are included. The term Scientific<a class = "tag" name =

applies only to those of the Artillery, Engineers, Pioneers, Flotilla,
and Marine.</p>

<p>The scholars in the School Companies are either pupils or
attendants<a class = "tag" name = "tag3_35" id = "tag3_35" href =
"#note3_35">35</a> The pupils are taken, as already described, from the
Upper Houses of Education, after the close of their fourth year’s
course, (or,&nbsp;in the case of the Marine School Company, after that
of the second,) or they come direct from places of private
education.</p>

<p>The conditions for gratuitous admission from private educational
institutions into the School Companies are similar to those for
admission into the Houses of Education, with the difference, that in the
School Companies the sons of officials in the civil service, who have
served long and meritoriously, and are ill-provided for, may also claim
military places.</p>

<p>The candidates must be not under fifteen and not above eighteen years
of age; in the Marine School Company not under thirteen and not above
fourteen.</p>

<p>The Attendant pupils (<i>frequentanten</i>) come from the soldiers of
the Standing Army.<a class = "tag" name = "tag3_36" id = "tag3_36" href

Artillery, Engineers, Pioneers, and Flotilla; to be admissible, they
must, as a rule, have passed with credit through the Non-commissioned
Officer Schools of the Artillery or Engineer regiments, or of the

<p>The admission of Attendants (<i>frequentanten</i>) can only be
allowed without prejudice to the claims of candidates from the Upper

<p>Pupils who come direct from private education must, if they propose

inches;<a class = "tag" name = "tag3_38" id = "tag3_38" href =

8 inches high. And these and the Attendant pupils alike must at their
entrance into the School Companies pass an examination in the subjects
of instruction taught in the Upper Houses of Education.</p>

<p>A perfect knowledge of German is accordingly an indispensable
condition for reception into the School Companies, and can only in the
single case of the Marine School Company be under certain circumstances
overlooked.</p>

<p>At his entrance into the School Company every pupil takes the
military oath, and is from this day bound to eight years’ service in the
Standing Army, and two years’ service in the Reserve.</p>

<p>Each institution is provided also with four Sergeants as teachers,
together with a requisite number of additional persons required for
management, discipline, and service.</p>

<p>Religious superintendence and instruction is intrusted to a local
Ecclesiastic, and the medical duties to an Army Surgeon.</p>

<p>Scholars in the School Companies are to receive a practical as well
as a theoretical training. This is to be regulated according to the

<p>After the close of the course the pupils who have done remarkably
well enter the Infantry as Corporals, the pupils who have done well as
Exempts, with the corporal’s badge; those who have done moderately, as
Exempts; and those who have done either remarkably well, or well, will
be, without further examination, named as Cadets<a class = "tag" name =

down the sum required for outfit, or prove their legitimate claim to
exemption from this outlay, they themselves being consenting

<p>The arrangements of the School Squadrons, with a number of 60 pupils
in each, are analogous to those of the School Companies, special
attention only being given to instruction in riding and practical
exercise in the Cavalry service; for which purpose each Squadron is
provided with 71 horses.</p>

<p>The first of the School Squadrons forms a Regiment of Dragoons, the
second one of Lancers, and the third one of Hussars.</p>

<p>The subjects taught are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class = "in-one">

</div>

<p>On leaving, the pupils enter the Cavalry in the grades corresponding
to those mentioned above for the Infantry.</p>

<p>The Frontier School Companies, each of 120 pupils, give three yearly
courses.</p>

<p>In all essential points, these institutions are organized on the same
plan with the Infantry School Companies. As, however, Officers and
Non-commissioned Officers on the Military Frontiers are also intrusted
with the general administration, and accordingly require of necessity a
knowledge of political administration, of jurisprudence, and
agriculture, the range of the plan of study in the Frontier School
Companies is more extensive.</p>

<p>The following subjects are taught:&mdash;</p>

remarkably well enter the Artillery as Corporals, those who do well as
Bombardiers, the others as Upper Cannoneers.</p>

<p>The most distinguished scholars, however, pass at the close of their
second year into the Artillery Academy free of cost, as Attendant Pupils
(<i>frequentanten</i>,) with the rank of Lance-Corporals, to receive
there the education which will fit them for the rank of officers.</p>

practice.</p>

<p>Pupils who either through want of capacity or of diligence fall
behind in the theoretical instruction, will at the end of the second
year be sent on board ship as ship’s boys (<i>Schiffs-junge</i>.)</p>

<p>The other scholars go through the courses of the third and fourth

<p>The object of these is to prepare pupils for the instruction in

<p>They are four in number, with 200 pupils in each.</p>

<p>They contain military or treasury places, either wholly or half
gratuitous; places on provincial and private foundations; and finally
places for paying pupils.</p>

<p>The exact number of places open to pupils on provincial and private
foundations, and to paying pupils, can not be determined, as in this
respect the Cadet Schools form a single whole with the Academies, and
the amount can only be fixed as a total for these institutions taken
together. There are altogether 1,100 of these military places, which may
be distributed in varying proportions amongst the Cadet Schools and the
Academies; the number in any one of them can not be stated as a
rule.</p>

<p>The military foundations are reserved for the sons of Officers
serving or having served with the sword; the entirely gratuitous places
for the sons of Officers in want, and the half gratuitous places for
those of Officers provided with means of their own, or serving in higher
positions.</p>

<p>Appointments to the military and provincial foundations are granted
by His Majesty, the former on the recommendation of the Supreme War
Department, the latter on that of the Minister of the Interior. Among
the former are included, as already stated, the most distinguished
pupils of the Lower Houses of Education, for whose transfer to the Cadet
Schools the rules are laid down, the recommendation being annually
submitted for His Majesty’s approval.</p>

<p>Special regard will be given to candidates whose fathers have been
killed or invalided in the field; after these, to those who are orphans
on both sides; to the sons of Officers of special merit, of Officers
with large families, and the like.</p>

<p>Appointments upon provincial and private foundations, or as paying
pupils, will be made in the manner already stated in the general account
of the Educational Institutions.</p>

<p>The age of admission is the eleventh year completed, and twelfth year
not exceeded, and the candidate will be expected to know the subject of
instruction prescribed for the third class of the common (<i>normal</i>)
schools.</p>

<p>A knowledge of German, however, will not be considered indispensable.
Pupils who are not Germans will receive in the first half year of the
first course special instruction in German.</p>

<p>Those pupils who satisfactorily complete their four years’ course are
transferred, according to their capacities, and as far as possible, to
their own wishes, into one of the Military Academies. Entrance into the
Marine Academy takes place at the close of the second year.</p>

<p>Pupils who do ill, will, at the close of any one of the three first
years, be removed into the course of the following year at one of the
Upper Houses of Education; or, at the close of the fourth year, into one
of the Infantry School Companies.</p>

<p>This removal, in the case of paying pupils, will be dependent on the

<p>The object in these is to educate Officers in the higher military
subjects for the different arms of the service.</p>

<p>There are four Academies; the Neustadt Academy, the Artillery
Academy, the Engineers’ Academy, and the Marine Academy.</p>

<p>The scholars in each are divided into four yearly courses of nearly
equal numbers. In the Neustadt Academy each year is sub-divided into two
parallel classes, the instruction being the same in both.</p>

<p>The pupils in the Military Academies are of the different kinds
described in the account of the Cadet Houses, and the appointments
similarly made; the Academies and the Cadet Houses in these respects
forming a single body.</p>

<p>Candidates for admission into the Neustadt Academy, the Artillery
Academy, or the Engineers’ Academy, must be nearly, if not quite,
fifteen, and not above sixteen years old. For admission into the Marine
Academy, they must be nearly, if not quite, thirteen, not above fourteen
years old.</p>

<p>The Academies receive their pupils in the first instance from the
Cadet Schools, after the satisfactory completion of the fourth
(or,&nbsp;in the case of the Marine Academy, the second) year, and then,
as

already stated under the head of the School Companies, from the
Artillery School Companies, and from the Engineer, Pioneer, Flotilla,
and Marine School Companies, after the highly satisfactory completion of
the second (or,&nbsp;in the Marine School, of the fourth) year.</p>

<p>Pupils from these School Companies, before entering the Academies,
will take the Military Oath, receive the rank of Lance-Corporals, and be
admitted free of charge as Attendant Pupils into the Academies, to
receive their education for the rank of Officer. Scholars from the
general body of soldiers, who are attending the School Companies, are to

<p>Pupils who are found negligent in the course of their academical

<p>Wiener Neustadt having been the seat of this Academy for more than a
century, the ancient name thence derived will be retained in its usual
acceptation, though the Academies for the Artillery and the Engineers
will also be placed in the same locality. The institution counts 400
pupils, designed primarily for the Infantry of the Line and of the
Frontier, and secondly, for the Chasseurs and the Cavalry.</p>

<p>The Director of the Academy is a Colonel or General, attached to
whom, for purposes of instruction, discipline, and general management,
there are three field and thirty-four other Officers; for religious care
and instruction, four Ecclesiastics; for medical attention, one
Regimental Surgeon, one Army Surgeon, and one Surgeon’s Assistant; for
the accounts, one Accountant, and four Accountant’s Assistants. The
large number of pupils maintained in the institution requires, moreover,
a proportionately large staff for superintendence, a numerous body of
attendants, servants, and the like; so that the whole number to be added
to that of the pupils does not fall short of 309 persons; 64 horses are
allowed for the riding lessons.</p>

<p>The plan of study is based on that of the Cadet Schools, and embraces
the following subjects:&mdash;</p>

<p>The object here is a double one; first, to bring up good and
serviceable teachers in the subjects of study prescribed for the
Military Houses of Education; secondly to provide at the same time
instructors in gymnastics and fencing for all the military schools and
for the troops. The institution accordingly consists of two departments,
each of thirty Attendant Pupils, receiving instruction in these two
different branches.</p>

<p>Non-commissioned Officers are admitted after a service of at least
two years. Candidates for admission into the Teachers’ department must,
in addition, possess the required amount of knowledge in the subjects
taught in the Military Houses of Education; and, as a rule, must know,
besides German, one other of the Austrian national languages.
Proficiency in every one of the subjects will not be considered
essential. Candidates for admission to the Gymnastic and Fencing
Department will be required to show a certain amount of readiness in the
use of arms and in gymnastic exercises, and an evident capacity for
acquiring greater skill.</p>

<p>Registration for admission is to be obtained in the usual course of
the service from the Supreme War Department.</p>

<p>The Attendant Pupils receive, in addition to their ordinary pay,
bread and the extra allowance; and for their better subsistence also an
allowance corresponding to that granted for provision during a
march.</p>

<p>The command is held by a Field Officer or Captain; six Subaltern
Officers and four Sergeants act as teachers, the latter as assistants in
the instruction in fencing and gymnastics, and as swimming master. The
instructor in the art and methods of teaching may be a civilian.</p>

<p>The subjects of instruction in the Teachers’ Department
are&mdash;</p>

<span class = "pagenum">

to Military Exercise.</p>

<p>Instruction in all the subjects will be given with special reference
to the methods to be pursued in teaching them in the various Military
Schools.</p>

<p>The course in each Department lasts one year. Under certain
circumstances particular pupils in the Teachers’ Department may remain
for the further completion of their studies a second year in the
institution.</p>

<p>In the Teachers’ Department, pupils who show no aptitude or liking
for some particular subject, may be exempted from attending the lessons
given in it, so as to allow them to give more thorough attention to
other branches.</p>

<p>After passing the examination, the pupils are either sent immediately
to undertake duty in the Military Schools, or return to their service in
the troops, and pass, as occasion requires, into the Military Schools.
Corporals who distinguish themselves by remarkably good progress will be
promoted to the rank of Sergeant.</p>

service in the Artillery and Engineers.</p>

<p>Twenty Officers, of more than usual capacity, between twenty-one and
twenty-six years of age, will be admitted from each of the two arms.
They must be unmarried, and must have served with distinction during a
period of not less than two years.</p>

<p>Officers in whose cases these conditions are satisfied, and who
desire to be admitted to the course, apply for registration for
admission to the examination, in the ordinary form, to the War

<p>Candidates for the Artillery will be, moreover, examined in the
Tactics of the three Arms, and in Artillery; and those from the
Engineers, in the Art of Fortification and in Civil Architecture, both
Plain and Ornamental.</p>

<p>The text-books used in the Academies of the Artillery and Engineers
will serve as a measure for the range of attainment required. Pupils who
passed with distinction through these Academies will thus be specially
fitted for admission into the Higher Course after they have proved,
during their time of service, their diligence in bringing the knowledge
they have acquired into actual application.</p>

<p>On the close of this preliminary examination, the results will be
submitted to the Supreme War Department, and the recommendations for
admission laid before His Majesty.</p>

<p>A superior Field Officer, either of the Artillery or the Engineers,
will be intrusted with the charge of the united course. The lectures
will be given by the Professors of the Academy of the Artillery and
Engineers. From the nature of the duties, partly common and partly
distinct, which devolve upon the two corps, it follows that the course
of the studies (which will be carried on during two years) will in like
manner be partly common and partly separate.</p>

<p>The subjects of common instruction will be&mdash;</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>1. Mechanics in application to Machinery, combined with Machine
Drawing. 2.&nbsp;Natural Philosophy and Chemistry, combined with
practice in manipulation, in making experiments, and in analyzing.

as Officer uninterruptedly and with distinction two years at least with
the troops, and, provided, finally, he has passed the prescribed
preliminary examination.</p>

<p>For admission to the examination, registration, to be obtained in the
usual form from the War Department, is requisite.</p>

<p>The examination is conducted between October 10th and 20th, in the
War School buildings; the registered candidates will be summoned to
Vienna at the beginning of October; traveling expenses will be paid by
the Treasury. The subjects are&mdash;</p>

<div class = "in-one">

to speak one of the national languages of the Austrian Empire, Slavonic,
Hungarian, or Italian, and must write a good current and legible
hand.</p>
</div>

<p>The amount of knowledge required in these subjects will be regulated
by the range of the text-books prescribed for use in the Academy at
Neustadt. Regard, however, will not so much be given to the minutiæ of
knowledge possessed by the candidate, but rather to the evidence of his
having a correct judgment and quick apprehension, and the power of
expressing himself both orally and in writing.</p>

<p>Upon the results of the examination, formally drawn up by the
authorities of the school, recommendations for admission will be
submitted to the sanction of His Majesty.</p>

<p>The number of attendants in the War School is fixed at thirty, and
the length of course is two years.</p>

extra allowance of thirty florins monthly.</p>

<p>The War School is commanded by a General or Superior Field
Officer.</p>

<p>Five Field Officers or Captains, taken as a rule from the Staff, give
lectures on the prescribed scientific subjects. One Field Officer or
Captain of Cavalry takes the duty of riding-master; and one civil
Professor that of instruction in the French language and literature.
Necessary officers, attendants, and servants take the duty of adjutants,
of the internal management, of the service, and of attending to the
thirty horses.</p>

<p>The first year’s subjects of instruction are&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>The course begins on the 1st of November, and lasts to the end of
September.</p>

<p>The Attendants at the War School must be practiced in those arms in
which they have not served. They are for this purpose distributed into
the various bodies of troops forming the garrison of Vienna, go through
the exercises and manœuvres of these troops&mdash;in the first year with
one, and in the second with the other arm. At the termination of these
periods of practice, they will be called upon to undertake the command
of a Battery, of a Squadron of Cavalry, and of a Division of
Infantry.</p>

<p>In the month of May, the attendant pupils of the first year will go
out upon a course of practical surveying; those of the second year will
be similarly employed in reconnoitring, choosing sites for encampment,
discovering, judging of, and describing proper points for taking up
positions, forming <i>têtes-de-pont</i>, entrenched camps, and the like,
and in performing other duties falling within the service of the
Staff.</p>

<p>At the beginning of October, the pupils of the second year will
undergo an examination, which will be conducted, both orally and by
papers.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page441" id = "page441">441</a></span>
<p>Upon the results of this the Supreme War Department will determine
upon their promotion to the rank of First Lieutenants (if&nbsp;they are
not already of that rank,) and this without any reference to their
previous position, their position henceforth being simply determined by
their merit.</p>

<p>The same grounds determine the cases of those who are admitted to the
Staff, or who return to their respective arms.</p>

<p>Those who, after a satisfactory completion of the course, return to
service with the troops, will, after three years’ meritorious service,
be specially recommended for extraordinary promotion.</p>

<h4><a name = "austria_remarks" id = "austria_remarks" href =
"#austria">III. REMARKS ON THE AUSTRIAN MILITARY EDUCATION.</a></h4>

<p>The English Commissioners in their General “<i>Report on the
Education and Training of Officers for the Scientific Corps</i>” hold
the following language:&mdash;</p>

<p>The magnitude of the Military Education of Austria entitles it to
rank among the chief Institutions of the Empire. It has been remodeled
since the wars of 1848, 1849. It is now centralized, and wholly directed
by one of the four Co-ordinate Sections of the War
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page442" id = "page442">442</a></span>
Office, which is independent of the others, and reports directly to the
Emperor. This Educational or “Fourth” Section has the control of between
300,000<i>l.</i> and 400,000<i>l.</i> yearly. It provides for the free
or nearly free education of more than 5,000 pupils. The extent and
completeness of the system will be best understood by a reference to the
clear and valuable official account of the schools.<a class = "tag" name
= "tag3_56" id = "tag3_56" href = "#note3_56">56</a></p>

<p>The military schools are divided by this document into (1) those
which educate pupils for <i>Non-commissioned Officers</i>, (2) those
which educate for <i>Officers</i>, (3) and those <i>Senior Schools</i>
which complete the education and extend the instruction of both classes.
The method of training Non-commissioned Officers is a peculiar and
remarkable part of the system.</p>

<p>1. No less than 5,730 pupils are in process of being educated for
Non-commissioned Officers. They are received into a Military School at
seven years old, and at that early age are devoted to the army, with a
kind of solemnity, by their fathers, somewhat similar to the practice at
Woolwich Academy :&mdash;“I&nbsp;hereby pledge myself to surrender up my
son to the Imperial Military Service, in case of his being admitted into
a Military Educational Institution, and I will under no pretext require
his return.” This promise, as the official document states, may no doubt
be recalled if the youth finds that he has mistaken his vocation; but it
must exercise great influence (and such is its avowed object) in
retaining him in it.</p>

<p>After passing successively through two Junior Institutions,&mdash;the
Lower Houses of Education, where he continues till eleven years old, and
the Upper Houses, where he remains till fifteen,&mdash;the boy receives
his finishing course in one of what are termed the School Companies, the
highest class of schools for training boys to become Non-commissioned
Officers in all arms of the service. These are twenty in number, and
scattered over the whole Empire, containing generally 120 pupils each,
though in one case only sixty; and with a course of either two or three
years, according to the nature of the service. The extent and the
requirements of the Empire give a striking variety to their character.
Thus, in the frontier School Companies, “the range of the studies is
more extensive, because the Non-commissioned Officers on the Military
Frontiers are intrusted with the general administration, and require of
necessity a knowledge of Political Administration, of Jurisprudence, and
Agriculture;” and thus also the Non-commissioned Officers for the
responsible Flotilla Service of the mouths of the great rivers, the
lagoons of the Po, the head of the Adriatic, and the lakes, are
carefully
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page443" id = "page443">443</a></span>
educated and frequently promoted. Following the course of a pupil
through these Upper Houses and School Companies, we were much struck by
the sensible and vigorous character of the education, and the motives
supplied for exertion. In the Upper Houses the boys compete for entrance
to the School Companies which they prefer, and the more scientific
companies are a special object of ambition, because it is more usual in
these for young men to be raised by their talents to the Academies, and
thus made Officers, “free of all cost:” according to the regulations,
however, this is possible in all. It may be stated that from six to ten
pupils from each of the more scientific School Companies,&mdash;the
Artillery, Engineer, Pioneer, Flotilla, and Marine Companies,&mdash;are
yearly transferred to the Academies, to complete their education there
for the Officer’s Commission.</p>

<p>A system of this kind, supplying at once a good education and large
opportunities of advancement, must necessarily operate as a great
encouragement to young men educating for Non-commissioned Officers; and
allowing for the social differences of the two countries, it resembles
in spirit the French system, which throws open the gates of the
Polytechnic and St. Cyr, and with them a proportion of the Commissions
in the Army, to all.</p>

<p>This, however, is not all. The sums devoted to the education of
Non-commissioned Officers, as well as Officers, are immense, and may be
regarded as a spontaneous contribution of the National Feeling, no less
than a State provision. A&nbsp;system both of public and private
foundations (<i>Stiftungen</i>) prevails&mdash;part derived from the
Emperor, part from the provinces, part from private gifts and
legacies&mdash;by which 3,190 pupils are supported in the Houses of
Education and the School Companies, and 1,320 in the Cadet Schools and
Academies. The very large majority of these exhibitions supply a
<i>complete</i>, about 200 a <i>partial</i>, maintenance. And it is
curious to observe the aid to education which is so common in our own
Universities, devoted in Austria to what may be termed the great
National Institution&mdash;the Army,&mdash;and retaining all the
limitations to the descendants of Founders or Natives of provinces which
marked our own foundations. Some of these exhibitions have been founded
by foreign soldiers for their own countrymen. Thus there are two bearing
the name of the O’Gara and the O’Brady, to be held by any Irishmen of
good family, one of which is in the gift of the Roman Catholic
Archbishop of Dublin. We should add that this system is still a living
and popular one. Within three years the city of Brünn has founded such
an exhibition “for sons of Austrian subjects in Moravia, and by
preference in Brünn, in

commemoration of His Majesty’s escape from assassination in 1853.” We
ourselves heard a distinguished Officer express an intention of founding
one of these Exhibitions. The comparison with the open <i>Bourses</i> of
the Polytechnic is remarkable; but the Austrian appointments to free
places seem to be given, like the Prussian, solely as rewards for the
service of the parent.</p>

<p>2. The education of young men for Officers is conducted upon the same
principles which regulate that for Non-commissioned Officers. The age of
admission to a Cadet School is about eleven. The pupils are pledged to
the service with the same formalities which we have noticed in the Lower
Houses of Education. Between fifteen and sixteen they enter one of the
Academies for the Line, the Artillery, the Engineers, or the Marine, and
after four years they pass to their respective services.</p>

<p>Thus, unlike the French system, that which is followed in Austria
commits the pupil to the Army, and to a Military Education, from an
early age, resembling herein the plan of the <i>Accademia Militare</i>
of Turin. But an attempt seems to be made to combine general with
special teaching. Thus, although even in the two first years (from
fifteen to seventeen,) at Wiener Neustadt, there is some introduction of
successful practical military teaching, the chief weight is thrown upon
mathematics, history, geography, drawing, and French; special military
teaching has a greater, though far from an exclusive place, in the two
last years. The studies are high, and (as&nbsp;far as we could judge)
pursued carefully, and with excellent discipline.</p>

<p>The description we have given of the system pursued in the Schools
for Non-commissioned Officers will have shown that there is a constant
appeal to emulation. The same is found at Wiener Neustadt. There is a
careful system of assigning credits during the whole school period,
which itself argues competition. The chief immediate reward, indeed, is
the choice of a regiment on leaving the school; but the prospect of
entering the Staff School stands in no distant perspective, and this is
filled with so many pupils from Wiener Neustadt, that it must be looked
upon as the sure reward of a successful Neustadter. There are other
inducements of a different character. The discipline being strict,
pupils are constantly removed from Wiener Neustadt and the other
Academies to the schools for Non-commissioned Officers, and though
sometimes allowed to enter the army as Officers, it must always be as
juniors to their contemporaries at Wiener Neustadt. We heard instances
of great strictness in this matter.</p>

<p>The new course for the Special Arms in Austria is not yet completely
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page445" id = "page445">445</a></span>
in operation. It is at present carried on separately in the Academy of
Olmütz for the Artillery, and that of Znaim, in Moravia, for the
Engineers. There are 200 pupils in each Academy, and the courses of
instruction, which are more special or technical than at Wiener
Neustadt, last four years, from the age of fifteen to nineteen. The
yearly examinations, the manner in which the marks of the monthly
examinations tell on the final one, and the careful classification of
the pupils in the order of merit, reminded us of the system of the
Polytechnic more than any other school we have seen. And an inspection
of the very high credits obtained by the first thirty pupils will prove
the diligence with which the studies are pursued. We should add that
several pupils of marked talents come from the scientific School
Companies, A&nbsp;further fact bears witness to the vigor of the
discipline. We have alluded to the dismissal of unpromising subjects
from the Austrian Military Schools. In the course of three years, since
the changes of 1850, it appears that nearly 100 pupils were removed from
Znaim, as not coming up to the standard required for the Engineers by
the new regulations.</p>

<p>3. The courses of instruction in the three Academies for Infantry and
Cavalry, Artillery, and for Engineers, last for the same time, and run
(as&nbsp;it were) parallel to each other. Each is, or is to be,
completed by a senior department. The United Course for the Artillery
and Engineers is not indeed yet combined in the magnificent buildings
begun at Wiener Neustadt; but it is already organized in a provisional
state at Znaim for the Engineers, and the plan of instruction drawn up
is a solid one. The arrangements for the general Staff School require
more remark.</p>

<p>In our report upon Austrian schools we have specially noticed this
School as remarkable for its thorough and open competitive character
from first to last, and its very sensible plan of study. Admission to it
is by competition, open to Officers of all arms: the pupils are not
unduly overburdened with work; perhaps, there is even room for one or
two more subjects of importance; but what is done seems to be done
thoroughly; the Officers are carefully ranked, on leaving the School,
according as the abilities they have displayed, may be considered a
criterion of their fitness for employment on the General Staff; and
<i>in this order</i> they enter the Staff Corps. The consequence is that
every Officer knows distinctly, from the time that he first competes for
admission until his final examination on leaving, that the order in
which he will enter the Staff depends entirely on his own exertions and
success at the school. It seemed
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page446" id = "page446">446</a></span>
to us that this open competition produced a spirit of confidence and
energy in the students, as great, if not greater, than any we met with
elsewhere.</p>

<p>The whole of the above system of education is directed by the Fourth
Section of the War Department. In all the schools we found traces of its
activity; and the energy and system which prevail in the Military
Teaching of Austria appear in great measure to result from its being
directed by this single head.</p>

<p class = "heading">[From Report of English Commissioners in 1856.]</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Staff School</span> (Kriegs-Schule,) in
Vienna, was established in 1851, and grew out of the experience of the
Hungarian war, although a Staff-Corps had existed for more than a
century in the Austrian army, and for many years past all the
appointments in it have been made upon an examination, which was, in
fact, one of competition. The process was formerly as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>An officer desirous of becoming a candidate for a staff appointment,
sent in his name to the colonel of his regiment, whose recommendation he
was obliged to obtain as a preliminary step. If supplied with this, he
began his course of staff study, and was sent for this purpose to some
large garrison town as an <i>attaché</i> to the staff. Whilst here he
went through, for two years, the course of drawing, writing military
memoirs, mapping the country, &amp;c., and for two years more served on
active staff duty with different bodies of troops. At the end of these
four years a number of the officers thus employed in a particular
country were brought together, and examined by the chief of the staff in
the country, assisted by a board of officers appointed for the purpose.
No actual list was drawn out of the order in which the candidates
acquitted themselves, but it was understood that the best were chosen
and put upon the general staff. The work upon this was exceedingly
laborious; few except officers of real ability were candidates for it,
and patronage in it was looked upon with great dislike. On the other
hand, studies and reading were not made the first requisite; a ready
intelligence and quick eye to make an officer a
<i>Colonnen-führer</i>,&mdash;leader of a column on a march,&mdash;were
always most valued.</p>

<p>Before describing this school, it may be as well to mention shortly
the staff-corps and the corps connected with it.</p>

<p><a name = "austria_vienna_general" id =
"austria_vienna_general">1.</a> The General Staff of the Austrian Army
consists of:&mdash;</p>

<div class = "inlist">
<p>Twelve Colonels.</p>

<p>Eighty Captains.</p>

<p>The <i>attachés</i>, to the number of eighty,&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>,
those who are expecting appointments, may be subalterns, but they obtain
the rank of captain on joining.</p>

<p>The chief of the staff-corps is Field-Marshal Hess.</p>

<p>2. There has been created very lately a separate corps of adjutants
or aids-de-camp, who are charged with the administrative duties, such as
inspecting the bearing, equipment, carrying on the discipline, &amp;c.,
of the troops. This consists of&mdash;</p>

<div class = "inlist">
<p>Eleven Generals.</p>
<p>Eighteen Lieutenant-Colonels.</p>
<p>Eighteen Majors.</p>
<p>Fifty-eight First Captains.</p>
<p>Ten Second Captains.</p>
<p>Ten First Lieutenants.</p>
</div>

<p>There is no examination for entrance into this corps. Appointments
are made by the generals, and we were told that there was some scope for
“protection.”</p>

<p>3. There is also a smaller corps for the purpose of surveying, called
the Corps of Geographical Engineers, connected with the staff, inasmuch
as some of the staff officers draw the maps on a large scale, which it
is the business of this corps to reduce. It is usually occupied on the
Great Surveys of the Empire; at present it is employed on the Survey of
the Principalities.</p>

<p>It consists of&mdash;</p>

<div class = "inlist">
<p>Eleven Generals.</p>
<p>One Colonel, called the Director.</p>
<p>Two Lieutenant-Colonels.</p>
<p>Two Majors.</p>
<p>Sixteen Captains.</p>
<p>Sixteen Lieutenants.</p>
<p>Four Sous-Lieutenants.</p>
</div>

<p>The staff school consists of thirty pupils taken from all arms of the
service, fifteen being received each year, and the course of study
lasting two years. It is under the direction of a general and a
lieutenant-colonel; and, with few exceptions, such as might occur in the
time of war, no appointments on the general staff are to be given to any
officers who have not passed through the staff school.</p>

<p>In order to enter the school for the staff corps, an officer must
have served at least two years with his regiment, and be unmarried, and
above twenty-one and under twenty-six years of age. He may then forward
to the chief of the staff, through his colonel, his claim to be admitted
as a candidate at the entrance examination. Further inquiry is made, and
a good many of the names sent in are struck off the list. Such, we were
told, was the case last year when the names sent in were very numerous,
but out of these only forty-five were allowed to compete, and out of
these again only fifteen (the regular yearly number) were selected. The
competition for entrance into the school is indeed said to have been
very active ever
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page449" id = "page449">449</a></span>
since it was opened. Most of the students are <i>Neustadters</i>; the
seven professors were all, with the exception of the professor of the
French language, military men, and chiefly officers of artillery, formed
in the long studies of the old Bombardier School.</p>

<p><a name = "austria_vienna_questions" id =
"austria_vienna_questions">The subjects</a> in which the candidates for
admission are examined are&mdash;</p>

<div class = "inlist">
<p>&nbsp; 1. Algebra and Geometry, Plane and Spherical Trigonometry.</p>
<p>&nbsp; 2. Geography.</p>
<p>&nbsp; 3. History.</p>

<p>12. To be able to speak one of the Austrian national languages, and

</div>

<p>The most striking features in the system of this school, both at the
entrance and throughout the course, are that it is distinctly
competitive, that it admits very young officers, and that while the work
is considerable, the subjects for study are not numerous. In these three
points it differs considerably from the Prussian Staff School, in which
the students are generally older, and the principle of competition is
not so fully carried out. In the Austrian school, the students are
placed on entering in the order which their entrance examination has
just fixed. They are examined once a month during their stay. On leaving
the school, their respective places are again determined, and they have
a claim for appointments in the staff corps in the exact order in which
they were placed on leaving the school.</p>

<p>Their relative places on leaving the school are assigned to them, as
we were assured, very carefully, and, after much consultation in every
case among the professors; but this is not done by marks, nor by any
minute system of testing intellectual qualifications, but an estimate is
formed upon the whole work of the two years, both on the studies in the
school and the practice in the field,&mdash;of the student’s comparative
fitness, <i>as an officer, for the work of the staff</i>. “We try to
estimate the whole man,” was the expression used to us, “whether he will
make a good <i>Colonnen-führer</i>” (a&nbsp;good man to direct a
regiment on a march,) as was said elsewhere. This general estimate was
preferred to that of marks, on the ground that the latter might give too
much weight to the more appreciable, <i>i.e.</i>, simply intellectual
qualities.</p>

<p>The students do not at present live within the establishment, but
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page450" id = "page450">450</a></span>
are to do so when the new ones, building, are ready. They begin their
lectures at half-past seven and end at one or three o’clock on alternate
days, going to the riding-school in the afternoon on the days when their
morning’s work ends at one. Thirty horses are kept for their use.</p>

<p><a name = "austria_vienna_subjects" id =

<p>The students are occupied at the school about eight hours daily and
their chief work is military drawing and topography. We went into the
room where the students of both years were working together at drawings
and plans under an artillery officer, said to be one of the best
draughtsmen in the army. Some of the plans were modeled in soap, the
<i>hachures</i> being marked very elaborately, so that the models and
drawings might closely correspond. We also attended a lecture of the
second class in military geography. A student traced out on the
blackboard the line of the Western Alps, and was examined very closely
on the smaller passes, the rivers, and the bases of operations for
armies on both sides. The answers were very minute, and given with the
greatest readiness; and we understood the question to be taken at
random, and not to be a prepared one.<a class = "tag" name = "tag3_57"

<span class = "pagenum">

<p>The student officers attending the school are called upon to serve in
those arms to which they do not belong. For this purpose they join the
troops of the garrison of Vienna during June, July, August, and
September, and if they belong to the infantry they go through all the
exercises of the cavalry in one year, and of the artillery in another.
If they belong to the cavalry, they go in the same manner through the
exercises of infantry and artillery. After going through this practice,
they have to take command of a battery, of a squadron of cavalry, and of
a division of infantry.</p>

<p>The month of May is devoted in the first year to an expedition for
practice in surveying the country, and in the second, for making
reconnaissances, &amp;c.</p>

<p>October is a vacation in the first year. In the second it is taken up
with the final examination before leaving.</p>

<p>The officers acting as professors receive 600 florins, about
60<i>l.</i> annually, besides their pay.</p>

<p>Immediately after the final examination, if there are any vacancies
in the staff corps, the pupils receive appointments in order of merit,
and are at the same time made captains. In proof of their receiving
appointments on the earliest opportunity, we were told by Colonel
Scudier that the last ten vacancies in the staff corps were filled up
out of the twelve students who had just left the school.
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page452" id = "page452">452</a></span>
One of these was only a second lieutenant, and in order to make him a
captain, (the rank required for the staff corps,) the Emperor promoted
him to be a first lieutenant immediately, and to be a captain within
three days afterwards. This double promotion was on the ground of great
merit.</p>

<p>If an officer finds no vacancy in the staff corps ready for him, he
must return to his regiment and wait as an attaché. But if a second
lieutenant, he is entitled immediately to a step of rank, and if a
lieutenant, after three years’ service he is made a captain, although he
may not even then be attached to the staff corps.</p>

<p>There are to be eighty of these attachés to the staff. Their number
at present amounts to only thirteen.</p>

<p>With regard to special aids-de-camp, generals are allowed to choose
their own, without examination, but with this limitation, the officer
chosen must not be a relation.<a class = "tag" name = "tag3_58" id =

<h5><a name = "austria_1869_principles" id = "austria_1869_principles"
href = "#austria_1869">PRINCIPLES OF MILITARY EDUCATION.</a></h5>

<p>The disastrous results to the integrity of the empire and the
reputation of the army, of the military operations of Austria in 1858,
against the combined forces of France and Sardinia, and of the still
more humiliating defeat in the brief but momentous campaign of 1866
against Prussia, forced the military authorities of the Austro-Hungarian
Empire to a thorough investigation of her military system and the
education of the officers of her armies. It was not difficult to account
for ultimate defeat in the larger armies and better prepared in all the
resources by which large armies are equipped, fed, and moved. But
military critics were not slow in discovering that better preparation
should have been made, the field should have been taken earlier, and the
forces combined and moved with great certainty and skill.</p>

<p>In a Report by the Minister of War on the necessity of reorganizing
the educational system of the Imperial army, and in the plan for such
reorganization the author, Baron Kahn, starts with a principle which the
great Empress Maria Theresa announced when she laid in 1748 the
foundation of the earliest war school in Austria (Wiener Neustadt), and
which Frederick the Great avowedly imitated in his War Academy in Berlin
in 1764,&mdash;“In this school shall be formed <i>men</i> only, and of
them, <i>soldiers</i>.” The choice of the profession of arms must be
postponed till a good general education, reaching the moral as well as
the intellectual and physical qualities of the future officer, has been
imparted. The separation of the military pupils from their families at
an early age must be avoided, and hence the number of cadet boarding
schools for young aspirants are diminished. The intellectual preparation
required, the sharpening and hardening the mental faculties, must not be
gained by an exclusive mathematical course, in special schools, but in
the general training of the public schools, the Real Schools or
Gymnasia, of the country. A&nbsp;more practical knowledge of the common
studies,&mdash;of geography and national history and the whole science
of public economy and the martial resources of the empire, must be
gained before the special military instruction begins. Admission to the
higher military schools must be given only to aspirants of mature age,
of high moral qualities, and of thorough intellectual
activity&mdash;ascertained by careful examination and tested by at least
one year’s service in connection with a regiment.</p>


<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page454" id = "page454">454</a></span>
<h5><a name = "austria_1869_reorg" id = "austria_1869_reorg" href =
"#austria_1869">PLAN OF REORGANIZATION.</a></h5>

<p>The military schools are divided into two classes, viz.:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1.) Those which give a boy a general education, but prepare him at
the same time for the military profession.</p>

<p>(2.) Those which educate boys only in military matters.</p>

<p>In the first class may be included (<i>a</i>) all those lower class
institutions in which military orphans and sons of poor non-commissioned
officers and commissioned officers are educated; (<i>b</i>) the middle
(cadet) schools which prepare students for the military academies;
(<i>c</i>) the military academies, viz, <i>Wiener Neustadt</i>, and the
engineer and artillery academies. As pure military schools, may be
mentioned the schools for non-commissioned officers in the infantry,
engineer, artillery, and pioneer corps; the cadet and division schools
in the infantry; the higher artillery and engineer courses.</p>

<p>(<i>a.</i>) The lower schools for the education of military orphans
of a tender age have the same system as the common schools of the like
class (<i>Normal</i> or <i>Volks Schulen</i>), where the moral qualities
are to be chiefly inculcated on Christian principles; it is therefore
necessary that children should not be taken from family influences
earlier than can be helped. It will therefore only be necessary to take
into these schools such children as are orphans, or sons of penniless
parents, or at all events those whose families can not be induced to
educate them at home even by pecuniary assistance. One school would be
enough for such boys, in which the moral education would be the first
object, as the necessary education required to prepare the scholars for
the higher schools and regimental cadet schools may be obtained by their
attending the public schools.</p>

<p>(<i>b.</i>) As regards the middle cadet schools, they should be
abolished, as they do not agree at all with the above-mentioned
principles. Boys are torn from home at much too tender an age, and are
not brought up in the path of morality. Should a reform only of these
schools be intended, this would be so expensive that the improvement
gained would be dearly paid for.</p>

<p>As the army is not only to be composed of drilled soldiers, but also
of generally well educated men, in order to improve their intellectual
position and the spirit of the army, and to prevent the undue growth of
drill and mere formalities, it is of great necessity that the military
schools should be brought into harmonious concert with the civil
schools. The deficiencies of the latter are less than those of the
former, and it may be expected that they will soon be removed. In
accordance with these considerations (and there are yet many more), it
is much to be recommended that these two institutions should be
abolished, not only as being right in principle, but also in agreement
with the laws of national economy.</p>

<p>By the laying down of the system of education to be taught at the
common middle schools, as a condition of being allowed to enter a
military academy, in connection with the influences of the moral
development of the family circle, up to the fifteenth year of a boy’s
life, it is to be hoped that the general above-named principles will be
attained; and when the poor officers are allowed the means to educate
their boys aspiring for the military academies by granting them
pecuniary allowances, it may be hoped that they will not only be
contented, and will care for the moral education of their children, but
that the State also will find in the system the best means of attaining
its object.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page455" id = "page455">455</a></span>
<p>As regards the higher schools, especially military ones, the
following may be observed:&mdash;</p>

<p>There are two establishments at present:</p>

<p>(<i>a.</i>) The Military Academy and Wiener Neustadt for general
education.</p>

<p>(<i>b.</i>) The Engineer Academy, as a special school for the
engineers, and for the instruction of officers in general.</p>

<p>The latter of the two is not efficient enough, for not more than
eight or ten persons at most are instructed as engineers in it, the rest
being detailed for the infantry, cavalry, &amp;c. As by the
establishment and organization of division schools a sufficient supply
of officers aspirant is provided, and as the officers detailed from the
above-named academies to the line are not more efficient than the
scholars of the division schools (especially when the extra cost of the
academy education is considered), the Engineer Academy must be looked
upon as much too expensive. I&nbsp;agree, therefore, with those who
recommend its abolition. On the other hand, the Neustadt Academy, which
offers to its students a more general, and therefore a better founded
education, and where highly instructed officers can be educated in
larger numbers, may be allowed to remain, both in consideration of its
efficiency and in honor of its serene foundress, the great Empress Maria
Theresa, but on condition of its being reorganized in accordance with
the principles laid down by that noble lady in the following
words:&mdash;“That in this school shall be formed <i>men</i> only, and
of them <i>soldiers</i>.”</p>

<p>The said academy must, however, seek to attain to a higher degree of
perfection than of late. The classics must be more cultivated, as also
national economy and a general civilized education. It should be
organized for a course of six years, and it should receive students,
sons of officers or military officials, who have successfully passed two
or three Latin or technical schools.</p>

<p>The following subjects should be taught, besides the military and
mathematical sciences:&mdash;</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>(1.) The Latin language, sufficient to understand the Roman
classics.</p>

<p>(2.) All human sciences; particular attention should be paid to
style, as it has been observed that since Latin has not been taught in
the Wiener Neustadt Academy, there has been a great falling off in this
respect. Rhetoric is to be taught in a practical manner, as the
knowledge of how to speak is of importance in our constitutional
era.</p>

<p>(3.) Philosophy, two years; in the first year, psychology; in the
second year, logic to its full extent, moral philosophy, metaphysics,
and the history of philosophy.</p>

<p>(4.) Statecraft, state and international law, and the fundamental law
of the Austrian monarchy.</p>

<p>(5.) The rudiments of economy and national economy.</p>
</div>

<p>As special schools for the army the following should be
retained:&mdash;</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>(<i>a.</i>) A special engineer and artillery school.</p>

<p>(<i>b.</i>) A special school for the pioneer corps, where the special
knowledge necessary for that arm, as well as other military matters, are
taught. The scholars should be between the ages of 16 and 19 years.</p>
</div>

<p>The students of the institutions intended for the education of the
engineers and artillery will be enrolled in their respective corps
quartered in Vienna. They will there have to pass a proper course of
high mathematics, natural philosophy, and architecture at the
Polytechnic; after they have succeeded in this, they will be either
detailed for two years’ active duty with their corps, or they may be at
once ordered to pass through a higher combined course for
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page456" id = "page456">456</a></span>
artillery and engineers. If this will suffice for the due supply of
technically instructed officers, the artillery and engineer academies
may be abolished.</p>

<p>As regards the present school for the General Staff, it may be
recommended that a general college for the whole army should be formed
from it, wherein not only the higher military sciences should be taught,
but also statecraft and national economy. It would be right to examine a
candidate before he entered the college in the rudiments of natural
philosophy and chemistry.</p>

<p>The student may obtain the time necessary for the cultivation of
these two sciences by reducing the time till now assigned to sketching
and surveying; the more so, as the student will have already attained a
great perfection in this branch of his education by former study of it
in the public and preparatory schools.</p>

"#austria_1869">AUSTRIAN STAFF.</a></h5>

<p>By recent ordinance the Special Staff Corps has been abolished. All
the officers are borne on the army rosters according to their ranks, in
particular branches of the service. No one will be allowed to enter the
Staff School until he has served three or four years with the troops,
and then captains and first lieutenants will be preferred to men of less
service or rank. Having passed through the school course they will again
join their regiments; and will then be appointed to the staff, as may be
required. The period during which they are to remain on the staff will
depend on their merits, their promotion, and the exigencies of the
service; but as a principle they would generally rejoin their troop on
promotion. There can be no doubt in the minds of those who have
practically studied the question, that the system is sound.
A&nbsp;special Staff Corps is never large enough to supply the demands
of an army in the field for long, especially if the war is long and very
active. The duties of a staff officer with an army actively engaged in
the field, are so numerous and arduous that an <i>enormous number</i>
are used up in the course of a campaign; and when you have only the
Staff Corps to draw from, the supply of practical officers is not equal
to the demand. The French experienced this in the Crimean War. By
educating a number of young officers endowed by nature with the
qualifications indispensable to form an <i>efficient</i> staff officer
<i>on active service</i>, and by throwing them back into their
regiments, they leaven the mass, and form a fund of selected and
instructed officers from which can be drawn as occasion may
require.&mdash;<i>Col. Crealock to Military Ed. Com.</i></p>

<h5><a name = "austria_brigade" id = "austria_brigade" href =
"#austria">CAVALRY BRIGADE SCHOOLS FOR OFFICERS.</a></h5>

<p>The following memorandum gives an account of an order lately issued,
regulating Officers’ Brigade Schools in the Austrian cavalry.</p>

<p>The object of the Cavalry Brigade schools will be to secure a supply
of efficient riding masters throughout the service capable of giving
general instruction.</p>

<p>The Central Cavalry School will continue to be a higher military and
scientific establishment, with (in&nbsp;addition to the theoretical
education of the pupils) a course of instruction which insures a uniform
system of equitation and of breaking horses. A&nbsp;certain number of
its best pupils may be transferred, after a year’s attendance, to the
<i>Kriegs-Schule</i>, with a view to their preparation for the
staff.</p>

<p>Cavalry Officers’ Brigade Schools educate officers of that arm,
theoretically as well as practically, in all their duties. After the
termination of the autumn manœuvres one will be formed in each brigade.
The annual course lasts six months, and should begin on the 1st of
October.</p>

<p>It is the duty of the Brigadier to superintend the school, but it is
also that of commanding officers of regiments to inform themselves of
the progress of their officers, and consequently to visit it often.</p>

<p>Before the 15th of August the Brigadier proposes to the Minister of
War the station at which the school should be established, also the
names of the instructors and pupils. It rests with him to make all
arrangements for setting it in operation; and as his supervision must be
continual, he should (whenever practicable) place it at the
head-quarters of his brigade. Above all, a covered riding school must be
fitted up; then a drill ground, a manège with artificial fences, and a
school, and fencing-room. Whenever possible the men and horses must be
in barracks.</p>

<p>The best qualified officer in the brigade, of the rank of
lieutenant-colonel or major, is to be selected for Commandant, and each
school is to have two captains as instructors. One of them must have
gone through the Central Cavalry School, and must have been reported as
specially qualified to give instruction; the second must be considered
one of the best horsemen in the brigade.</p>

<p>At the disposal of these officers there is the following
staff:&mdash;one veterinary surgeon for instruction in the anatomy,
diseases, and shoeing of horses; one sergeant in charge of the men and
horses; one sergeant for quartermaster’s duties and accounts; one
farrier; three corporals; one trumpeter; twelve men per regiment of the
brigade; and the riders of the horses attached to the school.</p>

<p>If there is an auditor (<i>Judge Advocate</i>) available, he attends
regularly to explain the Articles of War and give lectures on military
law. Should there be none, this duty devolves upon one of the captain
instructors.</p>

<p>Six officers from the rank of first lieutenant downwards are sent
yearly from each regiment. Each of them brings with him, besides his own
horses, the one allowed him by Government. Every regiment sends six
remount horses that have passed the first stage of breaking, and six
that have just joined.</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>The principal subjects of theoretical instruction are&mdash;1st,
Regulations of the army; 2d, Tactics, particularly as referring to the
handling of cavalry; 3d, Field movements, and especially outpost duty,
which are to be illustrated by examples from the history of war; the
pupils will also draw and describe a tract of country, and give written
reports upon field operations; 4th, description of the anatomy and
diseases of horses, with their management and feeding
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page464" id = "page464">464</a></span>
both in the stable and the field; shoeing theoretical and practical, in
all its details; 5th, thorough practice in the use of cavalry weapons, a
general acquaintance with the arms of the artillery and infantry of the
principal military nations, and an accurate knowledge of those employed
in the Imperial army; 6th, a general knowledge of field fortification
and of the works to be executed by the Pioneer Corps in combination with
cavalry; 7th, the study of tracts of country, extending to the
observation of roads, streams, coverts, and undulations; the correct
reading and understanding of maps.</p>
</div>

<p>The practical branch of education at these schools has for its main
object the maintenance throughout the army of the best fundamental
system of equitation, and the adoption of any improvements in the
cavalry service in general which may appear advisable. To this is added
practice in getting over long distances through every description of
country, and in judging when and where halts should be made with most
advantage to single horsemen, or to detachments of troops. These marches
are to be combined with patrolling, reconnaissances, and posting
piquets, and are to be practiced once a week.</p>

<p>After every such march the pupils will send in a brief report and
rough sketch, either next morning or within forty-eight hours, as may be
ordered. They are to practice making this sketch on horseback as well as
on foot. They must perfect themselves in gymnastics, and in fencing and
singlestick, both on foot and horseback.</p>

<p>The regulations issued to the Minister of War as to distribution of
hours and reports will be strictly followed, and no deviation will be
permitted except under particular circumstances. Sundays and holidays
are observed. No leave of absence, except in cases of urgent necessity,
can be granted to either instructors or pupils during the course.</p>

<p>At the end of the season of instruction (<i>i.e.</i> at the end of
March) the Cavalry Officers’ Brigade School will be broken up; and all
persons attached to it, and their horses, will return to their
regiments.</p>

There are four <i>Armies</i>; the First in the west, with its
head-quarters at Vienna; the Second in Italy, with its head-quarters at
Verona; and two others in the eastern provinces. Each of these is
divided into a certain number of Army Corps. The particulars may be seen

The Governor or Lord Lieutenant (the <i>Statthalter</i>) is the ordinary
representative of the Emperor in the various provinces composing the
Empire. In his hands resides the usual administration of the government.
The provinces have also their ancient Estates or Parliaments, Standing
Committees of which might, under certain circumstances, sit at times
when the Estates were not assembled.</p>

Small allowances, <i>e.g.</i> of 8<i>l.</i> for three years, are very

Thus, it will be seen, all candidates appointed to the Military places
in the schools are examined three times over by a medical officer. Where
the State does not pay, in the case of provincial or private
foundations, or of paying pupils, the same amount of precaution is not
thought necessary.</p>

<p><a name = "note3_14" id = "note3_14" href = "#tag3_14">14</a>
The difficulties of traveling appear to be considered in Austria too
great to allow of any examination (competitive or otherwise) before the
candidates provisionally admitted actually arrive at the school to which
they are appointed; if ill qualified, they are dismissed with the Chance
of a second trial.</p>

A pupil who was removed from the Academy at Wiener Neustadt might, for
example, enter the army as a simple Cadet, under the patronage of the
Colonel of a regiment, and might, but for this rule, receive rapid
promotion, and become the senior in rank of his comrades of the same
year at the School. In like manner, a pupil removed from a Cadet
Institution and transferred into a School Company, might, upon leaving
that, under certain circumstances, outstrip his late comrades at the
Cadet Institution.</p>

<p>The army of reserve numbered over 30,000 men, and is to be made more
efficient. The landwehr is only organized in the large towns. The army
is recruited by conscription. All men, from the age of 21 are liable to
serve, but the sons of the nobility (<i>hohe adel</i>) are exempt, and
they with the sons of superior employés in the service of the state have
the privilege of entering the military school of cadets. Those who are
drawn for the army are held liable to active service for eleven years,
but are kept under arms, when on the peace footing, only three years,
passing three years more in the Reserve when called out for actual
training, and held for service for the remaining five years in the
landwehr. No substitutes are allowed.</p>

<p>By the treaties of 1870, in time of war, the supreme command of the
army of Bavaria passes to the Emperor of Germany, and in the further
development of the Imperial policy, the military system of Bavaria as
well as of the other German States, will be merged in that of Prussia.
The following account of the system of Military Education, as it was in
1869, is taken from the Report of the Military Education Commission for
1870.</p>

<p>The Cadet Corps was by a royal decree of May 14th, 1864, placed on
the same footing with regard to instruction and final examination as the
Real Gymnasium, and by a further decree of April 2d, 1868, the
signification and value which are attached to an <i>Absolutorium</i>, or
certificate of final examination, of a Real Gymnasium, were equally made
to apply to an <i>Absolutorium</i> of the Cadet Corps.</p>

<p>There are three classes.</p>

<p>For admission into the first class, candidates must be acquainted

<p>On leaving the Cadet Corps&mdash;</p>

<p>(<i>a.</i>) Students who have obtained from the Examination
Commission a certificate of “especially qualified” are named candidates,
first class, for the rank of officer.</p>

<p>(<i>b.</i>) Students who have obtained a certificate of “qualified”

rank of officer.</p>

<p>Further, those who have displayed a “marked proficiency,” not only as
regards scientific acquirements but also as regards conduct and military
capacity, maybe appointed by the Education Commission to the rank of
sub-lieutenant.</p>

<p>These last, however, in common with the candidates mentioned under
heads (<i>a.</i>) and (<i>b.</i>) are required, after six months’
service in a division of the army, to pass through the military
scientific course in the War School, and at the end of the course to
undergo an examination. The same conditions are alike in force for the
young nobility entering the army from the <i>Pagerie</i> with the
<i>Absolutorium</i> of a gymnasium.</p>


<h5><a name = "bavaria_education_war" id = "bavaria_education_war" href

<p>There are two courses, viz.:&mdash;(<i>a.</i>) The preparatory
course. (<i>b.</i>) The military scientific course.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page470" id = "page470">470</a></span>
<p>All persons desirous to obtain commissions as officers, whether
compelled to enter the army, or volunteers, must undergo the preparatory
course at the War School, unless they are in possession of an
<i>Absolutorium</i> of a Latin or Real Gymnasium.</p>

<p>Candidates for the preparatory course (<i>a.</i>) must pass an
examination for admission, and as a qualification for admission must
have served an entire year satisfactorily in a division of the army.</p>

<p>After the completion of the preparatory course these students are
named candidates, second class, for the commission of officers, and as
such enter the military scientific course.</p>

<p>The following enter the second course:</p>

<p>(<i>a.</i>) Students with the <i>Absolutorium</i> of a Real
Gymnasium, or coming from the <i>Pagerie</i>.</p>

<p>(<i>b.</i>) Students who passed the preparatory course
successfully.</p>

<p>(<i>c.</i>) Those to whom military service is compulsory, and
volunteers, both possessing the <i>Absolutorium</i> of a Bavarian
gymnasium, and being desirous to become officers. These candidates must,
however, perform six months’ service satisfactorily, and on termination
of this service they are named candidates, second class, for the
commission of officers.</p>

<p>At the expiration of the military scientific course there is a
general examination of all candidates before the “Commission of High
Studies and Examinations,” and decision is given&mdash;</p>

<p>(<i>a.</i>) Respecting efficiency for the position of officer.</p>

<p>(<i>b.</i>) Respecting the army rank of those who have passed their
examination without reference to former rank
(<i>Chargen-verhältnisse</i>).</p>

<p>Very distinguished conduct before the enemy can alone exempt
candidates from this examination.</p>

<p>Candidates examined are classed by the above Commission under the
following heads; “<i>especially qualified</i>,” “<i>qualified</i>,” and
“<i>not qualified</i>;” and no candidate for the commission of officer
can be named officer without the certificate of “<i>qualified</i>.”</p>

<p>Candidates, who have shown the necessary efficiency to entitle them
to be appointed officers, are named candidates, first class, for the
commission of officer, or, in consequence of the diminished number of
officers in the active army, are promoted to be sublieutenants.</p>

<p>Only those candidates for the commission of officer, who have
received the certificate “especially qualified” in the above final
examination of the military scientific course, can present themselves
for admission into the War Academy.</p>

<p>In this school, consisting of two courses, each lasting a year, an
opportunity is afforded to all candidates, first class, for commissions
as officers to devote themselves to technical military science, and to
pursue the special studies having reference to the military operations
in question; and, in this school, only those candidates for the
commission of officer are received, who have successfully passed the
military scientific course, and who, at the examination passed before
the “Commission of High Studies and Examinations,” have been pronounced
“<i>qualified</i>” not only to remain in the Artillery and Engineer
regiment, but especially qualified to enter the Artillery and Engineer
School.</p>

<p>Immediately after passing the second course of the War School, and
before admission into the Artillery and Engineer School, these
candidates must serve six months in an Artillery or Engineer
regiment.</p>

<p>Candidates pass over from the first to the second course without a
general examination, and should a doubt exist respecting the efficiency
of any of the candidates, such candidates will be required to undergo a
special examination before the “Commission of High Studies and
Examinations,” who will decide, in the case of such candidates, whether
they are to go through the course a second time, or retire from it.</p>

<p>The same regulations apply for the second course, and the
appointments as sub-lieutenants of Artillery or Engineer students are
determined according to the number of officers required in those
corps.</p>

<p>Candidates for the Engineers are required, after passing through
their school, to undergo a six weeks’ course of design, during which
period each candidate must without assistance make a complete Drawing of
an edifice.</p>

ACADEMY.</a></h5>

<p>The War Academy has for its object the higher scientific and
practical education of officers, in every branch of the military
profession, on the staff, as also of the higher adjutants. It aims also
at the development of all military scientific subjects.</p>

<p>The War Academy has three courses, each lasting nine months, and the
intervals are employed in practical exercises.</p>

<p>The number of students in one course must, as a rule, not exceed
twelve, and every upper or sub-lieutenant who has served not less than
four years with the troops, can attend the academy.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page472" id = "page472">472</a></span>
<p>Officers are only admitted into this school who possess the requisite
knowledge of their respective branches of the military service.</p>

<p>Further, their conduct must have been highly satisfactory; they must
be sound in health, and their pecuniary affairs must be in good order,
and they must combine prominent mental qualifications with a tendency to
higher scientific attainments.</p>

<p>The “Commission of High Studies and Examinations” decides by
examination as to the necessary qualifications for admission; then
follows a summons, issued by the Ministry of War, to attend the War
Academy, and each time only for one year.</p>

<p>Officers who, on the decision of the Examination Commission, do not
display sufficient capacity or zeal, or whose military behavior or moral
conduct has not been satisfactory, will not be summoned to attend the
next course.</p>

<p>The scientific education of those admitted into the War Academy
consists also in&mdash;</p>

<p>(<i>a.</i>) Attending lectures at the University and the Central
Polytechnic School.</p>

<p>(<i>b.</i>) Higher lectures upon military scientific subjects.</p>

<p>(<i>c.</i>) Exercises in living languages.</p>

<p>The practical education embraces the duties of staff officers and of
higher adjutants, acquaintance with the different branches of military
service, also corporal activity, and especially exercises on

<p>Officers who, on the decision of the Examination Commission, have
during the three courses of the War Academy displayed zeal, talent, and
application, will, on leaving the academy, have their names sent in to
the King for especial notice.</p>

<p>Each of the military schools has its own commandant. The Cadet Corps
is commanded by a First Lieutenant of Infantry, the War School by a
Major of the Quartermaster-General’s Staff, the Artillery and Engineer
School by a Major of the Engineer Staff, and the War Academy by a
Colonel of the General Staff, to whom an Adjutant is attached.</p>

<p>With regard to the systematic process of education pursued in the
military schools, and to the application of the different means employed
to impart instruction, these establishments are placed under the
superior direction of the “Inspection of Military Schools;” in all other
respects, they are under the control of the Ministry of War, and the
professors employed in them are selected according to their special
qualifications.</p>

<p class = "heading">1.&mdash;<i>Organization and Admission.</i></p>

<p>The Royal Military School at Dresden was reorganized in 1867, after
the war, and organized like the schools of the same rank in Prussia.
Formerly it consisted of two separate schools, the artillery school and
the <i>Cadettencorps</i>, both completing the education of their pupils;
but now a higher academy in Prussia must be attended for finishing the
professional education, either in Berlin, Erfurt, &amp;c.</p>

<p>By the new “regulative,” the <i>Cadettencorps</i> in Saxony consists
of six classes, and has (1,) 20 free scholars; (2,) 84 half-free
scholars; (3,) 20 not free scholars&mdash;in all, 124. Besides these,
“volunteers” may be admitted; but, if foreigners, without any claim to
being admitted afterwards to the royal army.</p>

<p>For admission to any of the 124 places, the sons of officers of the
army, killed or invalid, or of such subalterns as have served 25 years,
and of civil officers of high merits, are preferred to others.</p>

<p>The aspirant must have completed his 11th year of age, and not be
over 18 years of age.</p>

<p>In general the boys must have, if 11 years old, the requisite
knowledge of Quinta; if 12, of Quarta; if 13, of Quarta; if 14, of
Tertia; if 15-17, of Secunda, of a gymnasium, (college.)</p>

<p>On admission, every pupil has to pay 100 thalers for a full
equipment, for books, &amp;c.; and to bring with him 12 shirts, 18 pairs
of stockings, 18 handkerchiefs, 6 drawers, 1 pair of house shoes, 2
white cotton night-jackets.</p>

<p>During his stay every pupil has to pay, (besides 25 thalers for books
when transferred to III,) annually, (<i>a</i>,)&nbsp;50 thalers, if a
free scholar; (<i>b</i>,)&nbsp;110 if half free; (<i>c</i>,)&nbsp;210 if
not free; (<i>d</i>,)&nbsp;260 if a Saxon “volunteer;” and,
(<i>e</i>,)&nbsp;300 if a foreign “volunteer.”</p>


<p class = "heading">2.&mdash;<i>Course of Instruction.</i></p>

<p>The course of instruction in the Military School embraces six years,
with six classes, of which, as was said before, VI, (the last,) V, IV,
and III correspond to V, IV, and III in a gymnasium, II and I to lower
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page474" id = "page474">474</a></span>
and upper Secunda, with the only difference, that instead of Greek,
instruction is given in English and in the elements of a military
education. It will be, therefore, sufficient to mention the course of
instruction in the highest class as given in the new regulation.</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>&nbsp; 1. Religion. (The number of lesson hours is not stated.)</p>

<p>&nbsp; 2. Latin: Written exercises; Livy, Ovid, Virgil.</p>

<p>&nbsp; 3. German: History of literature; explanation of dramatic
pieces; free discourses, with a verbal résumé, and debates.</p>

<p>&nbsp; 4. French: Translations; extemporalia; compositions; exercises
in speaking.</p>

<p>&nbsp; 5. Mathematics: Progressions; logarithms, and their
application; applying of algebra to geometry; trigonometry; elements of
stereometry.</p>

<p>&nbsp; 6. English: Oral and written exercises; free discourses on
historical and geographical subjects; review of the same in English;
reading of poetry.</p>

<p>&nbsp; 7. History: Modern history; review of universal history;
history of Northern Germany.</p>

<p>&nbsp; 8. Geography: Mathematical and physical geography; review of
political geography, with particular regard to Northern Germany.</p>

<p>&nbsp; 9. Natural philosophy: Electricity, magnetism, sound and

<p>10. Drawing of plans; finishing the designs of the survey.</p>

<p>11. Surveying: Topographical surveying on a large scale; drawing of
grounds; <i>croquiren</i>.</p>

<p>12. Free-hand drawing. (Not obligatory.)</p>

<p>Those cadets to whom, in consequence of the examination at the end of
the course, the testimonial of maturity for ensigncy can be given, are
presented to his Majesty as “characterized” ensigns, whilst all others
who do not answer the demands have to perform, in some other way, their
legal service in the army.</p>

SYSTEM AND EDUCATION IN HOLLAND.</a></h3>

<h4><a name = "holland_system" id = "holland_system" href =
"#holland">I. MILITARY SYSTEM.</a></h4>

<p><span class = "firstword">The</span> regular army of Holland is
divided into two portions&mdash;one of which takes all the ordinary
duties of the Dutch possessions beyond the seas, while the other serves
entirely in Europe. In the event of war, the Home army is liable to be
sent to the support of the Colonial army; but except in such emergency,
the officers and men of each portion are as distinct, almost, as though
they composed parts of the military forces of two independent countries.
The entire military force consists of the regular army of about 52,000
men, which can be swelled to twice that number in an emergency, by
militia conscripts and reserve levies.</p>

<p>The Dutch Colonial Army consists of regiments of cavalry and
artillery, as well as of infantry, of which the depots for recruiting as
well as of arms, ammunition, and ordnance, are at home. But the service
companies, when they have once embarked for their colonial stations,
return no more as armed bodies&mdash;and even as individuals, neither
officers nor men return until they have taken part in the avocations of
colonial life.</p>

<p>The army of Holland, both in its European and colonial branches is
recruited by voluntary enlistment. The term of service is six years,
beyond which, however, the soldier not disqualified by loss of health,
may remain. The service is not particularly attractive; neither the pay
being large, nor promotion from the ranks rapid, or certain, the
recruits are not drawn from the most intelligent, and enterprising
classes. Still, as discipline is strictly enforced, and the natural
courage of the Batavian race is good, there is seldom any outbreak or
disorder.</p>


<h4><a name = "holland_education" id = "holland_education" href =
"#holland">II. MILITARY EDUCATION.</a></h4>

<p>The officers, as a body, are well educated, and belong to the higher
class of society, and before admission to the service, they must prove
their qualifications by a rigid examination, which is practically
competitive, as promotion is determined by the order of merit, as shown
in the results. Preparation for the examination
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page476" id = "page476">476</a></span>
could be made, till recently, (1.) either by joining the Cadet Corps as
a volunteer, and after a specified term of service in the field,
undergoing an examination in the studies, and practical knowledge
required; or (2.) by going successfully through a regular course in the
Military Academy at Breda. The army is now officered exclusively from
the graduates of the Military Academy.</p>


<h4><a name = "holland_breda" id = "holland_breda" href =
"#holland">III. MILITARY ACADEMY AT BREDA.</a></h4>

<p>The Military Academy at Breda, prepares officers for every branch of
the service, and is well equipped in respect to buildings, and
appliances of illustration and practice, as well as with numerous
professors for doing its work as thoroughly as any school can which
receives its pupils so young.</p>

<p>Within an extensive redoubt, separated from the town by a rampart and
wet ditch, stands an old palace which the late King set apart as a
college for officers. Here are good stables and an ample stud, a
swimming school, and an extensive plateau, with cannon of every calibre,
which supplies the means of drill applicable to each branch of service.
The accommodation within doors is excellent. Youths, sleeping in long
dormitories, are yet separated one from another by curtains, within
which stand each inmate’s iron bedstead, his little dressing-table, his
basin, jug, clothes-press, and all other matters necessary to
cleanliness and comfort. There is a spacious hall or day-room, besides a
convenient dining-room, a good library, a well-stocked model-room, a
small but judiciously selected museum of arms, with a good collection of
minerals and fossils, of chemical and mechanical apparatus, &amp;c.
Finally, the class-books used in the place are compiled and arranged by
the professors, and, in every branch of science and learning touched by
them, appear well adapted to the purposes for which they are
intended.</p>

<p>The establishment of the Breda Military Academy, when full,
includes&mdash;besides the Governor, a major-general, and the
Commandant, a colonel&mdash;an adjutant, a quarter-master, three
captains of infantry, three of artillery, one of engineers, one of
cavalry; five first lieutenants of infantry, two of cavalry, three of
artillery, one of engineers; two second lieutenants of infantry, one of
cavalry, one of artillery, and two of engineers&mdash;two medical
officers and an apothecary. There are besides, of civilian professors
and teachers, seven; and the place is capable of accommodating one
hundred and ninety-two cadets. These, whether intended for the European
or colonial branch of the service, live and pursue their studies
together. The course comprises four years, during the first two of
which, all the
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page477" id = "page477">477</a></span>
cadets are educated together without reference to the specific corps or
services for which they may be intended: but with the commencement of
the third year, such as may be selected for the artillery or engineers
pass into distinct classes, while the remainder go on, by a less
abstrusely scientific course, to commissions in the cavalry or
infantry.</p>

<p>The qualifications for admittance into the Academy are not
extravagantly high. Youths seem to be eligible who can read, write, and
spell their own language correctly&mdash;who are able to construe an
easy Latin author, and exhibit some acquaintance with the French; who
are advanced in arithmetic to vulgar fractions, can demonstrate an easy
proposition in geometry, and are masters of the fundamental processes of
algebra. During the two first years all are well instructed in history,
geography, mathematics, fortification, the theory of projectiles,
plan-drawing, the French and German languages. After this they break up,
and pursue their peculiar studies in different rooms under different
teachers. Their progress is tested by severe periodical examinations;
according to the results of which, they are either advanced or held
back. But as no second trial is granted in the examination for
admittance, so two failures at any of the examinations which follow,
insure dismissal from the Academy. Finally, prayers are read daily to
the cadets in a large hall, where also, if the weather be unfavorable,
one of the ministers from the town attends on Sunday to celebrate public
worship. When the weather is fine the young men march to
church&mdash;Protestants under their own officers to a Protestant place
of worship&mdash;Roman Catholics under like surveillance to a Roman
Catholic chapel.</p>

<p>Although the army is to some extent officered from the ranks for
meritorious service, or from those who have performed duty in the field
under a peculiar system of cadetship, as well as from the graduates of
the Military Academy, it is proper to add, that no promotion can be
made, or commission issued, until a satisfactory examination has been
passed. The prospect of this examination keeps up the habit of
professional study and reading, as well as a feeling of honorable
rivalry among officers of the same grade.</p>

<h4><a name = "holland_education_nav" id = "holland_education_nav" href

MARINE.</a></h4>

<p>There are ten special Navigation Schools (besides a nautical division
in the Academy at Groningen) located in the principal commercial ports,
and among the sea-going population. They are generally under the
management of local mercantile societies, but subject to government
inspection, and final examination, on which the rank of the graduates as
first, second, and third mate, depends.</p>

<p>The pupils are admitted on examination in the elementary studies,
physical ability, and aptitude for sea-service.</p>

<p>The course in the best schools embraces, besides a review of the
elementary branches, a knowledge of geography, especially of the climate
and products of different countries; mathematics, including
trigonometry, nautical astronomy, practical use of instruments at sea,
and the calculation of latitude and longitude, a knowledge of the code
of signals, the laws of storms and tides, mercantile laws and usages,
and practice in letter-writing, keeping the ship’s books, and
chart-drawing.</p>

<p>Opportunities of practice are secured on vessels in port, in
coasters, and even long voyages to the West and East Indies.</p>

<p>Ability to hold the rank of mates depends on the results of the final
examination, and promotion from one position to a higher depends on
successive examinations, after leaving the schools.</p>

<p>The statistics of attendance at these schools in 1867 were as
follow:</p>

<p>The time of service in the standing army is 10 years, on the implied
condition of the men being sent on furlough, in time of peace, for
one-half the period. A&nbsp;certain number, distinguished as “soldati
d’ordinanza,” to which class belong the Carabinieri and some of the
Administrative troops, have to serve eight years complete, and are then
liberated. In the army of reserve, the time of service
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page482" id = "page482">482</a></span>
is 5 years. Every native of the kingdom is liable to the conscription,
and to be enrolled either in the standing army or the reserve. An
exemption in favor of young men studying for the priesthood, was
repealed by a law which passed both houses of parliament in May,
1869.</p>

<p>The distribution of the standing army over the kingdom was as follows
in the middle of 1869. There were 8 battalions of infantry at and near
the capital, 5 at Genoa, 5 at Turin, 9 at Alessandra, 12 in Tuscany, and
120 in the valley of the Po, from Milan to Ancona. The troops in the
valley of the Po were supported by 24 squadrons of heavy and 36
squadrons of light cavalry, and 248 pieces of artillery. At Naples there
were 18 battalions of the line, 2 of marines, and 3 of bersaglieri; in
the Neapolitan provinces, 39 battalions of the line, 20 of bersaglieri,
and 32 squadrons of cavalry. There were, finally, 32 battalions of the
line in Sicily.</p>

<p>The system of military education of the old kingdom of Sardinia has
been enlarged and extended by the government of the Kingdom of Italy so
as to embrace the military schools of Naples, without any change in its
principles or details.</p>

<h4><a name = "sardinia_outline" id = "sardinia_outline" href =
"#sardinia">I. GENERAL OUTLINE OF MILITARY SYSTEM, AND MILITARY
EDUCATION.</a></h4>

<p><span class = "firstword">The</span> wars in which Sardinia has
recently been engaged, have led to the re-organization of her armies,
and to the extension and improvement of institutions for military
instruction, but time enough has not yet elapsed to perfect the
system.</p>

<p>One-third of the officers are promoted from the ranks; the remaining
two-thirds, that is, all who enter as officers, must pass through the
Royal Military Academy, and before being commissioned as Captain in the
Artillery and Engineers, must have completed the special course in the
Complementary School. Admission to the Royal Staff Corps is conditioned
on attendance on the lectures of the Staff School, and the results of a
competitive examination. The following is a brief outline of the system
of military instruction now in operation.</p>

<p>1. The character of the education may be described generally as
partly resembling that of Austria, partly that of France. It commences
very early. Every Officer who enters the Army as such must have passed
through the great Military School, the <i>Accademia Militare</i>. The
minimum age of entrance is fourteen. The admission is by nomination and
not by competition; and the demand has always been under rather than
above the requirements of the Army. “Bourses” or Exhibitions to assist
pupils in their education, have been established on the Prussian and
Austrian, rather than on the French principle. They are granted by the
King on the recommendation of the Minister, in consideration of the
claims of deceased Officers, or other public servants, and without
reference to the merits of the pupils, preference being given to the
candidates whose circumstances most require assistance. From twenty-five
to thirty of these <i>Bourses</i> (or&nbsp;rather <i>Demibourses</i>,
for no pupils receive entire support such as is given in France,) are
given annually. We are informed that a decree will appear almost
immediately, throwing open <i>ten</i> out of this number to public
competition. The entire sum expended upon them is 70,000 francs, about
2,800<i>l.</i> per annum.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page484" id = "page484">484</a></span>
<p>Passing from this outline of the principles of Sardinian Military
Education, as exhibited in the <i>Accademia Militare</i>, which may be
termed the General Seminary of the Sardinian Army, we shall briefly
allude to the <i>three</i> remaining Institutions, in which Officers
receive instruction and training at later periods of their career.</p>

<p>2. Admission into the Artillery and Engineer School may be considered
the reward of the most distinguished pupils of the <i>Accademia
Militare</i>, who after spending their last year in that Institution in
the study of the higher mathematics, chemistry, and architectural
drawing, are transferred for the completion of their education to the
School of the Artillery and Engineers.</p>

<p>3. The Staff School, the formation of which dates from 1850, is
chiefly frequented by Officers of the Infantry and Cavalry, who must be
below the age of twenty-eight years upon their entrance. It is carried
on upon the competitive system, the Officers being ranged according to
merit in their Final Examination, the ablest entering the Staff Corps in
that order.</p>

<p>4. Regimental Schools for Officers also exist, and in every Brigade
or Division, Officers are taught <i>topography</i>, under the
supervision of the Chief of the Staff of the Division. Care is taken to
make this teaching uniform throughout the Army; and it may be regarded
as preparatory to that of the Schools at Ivrea and Pinerol, which accord
with the principle of the Prussian Division Schools in requiring that
every Officer shall have received professional instruction; but as
regards other points, and particularly the period for attending them,
these Schools are peculiar to the Sardinian Army. In time of peace, no
Officer, excepting those of the Special Arms, can obtain a Company
without having studied for a year in one or the other of these Schools,
and having passed an examination on leaving it. The Instruction given is
mainly practical, Field Fortification, the Secondary Operations of War,
and Topography, being the branches of Military Science taught.</p>

<p>These Institutions appear to have been <i>primarily</i> established
with a view to the instruction of Officers and Non-commissioned Officers
throughout the Army, and in order to prevent Regiments or Corps from
following some peculiar system of their own. The same motive seems to
have led to the gradual reduction in number of the Prussian Division
Schools. <i>Secondarily</i>, however, these Schools have been made
available for the purpose of organizing and drilling the reserve of the
Sardinian Army, a large body of Conscripts assembled for a few weeks in
the autumn of each year in a camp

about twelve miles from Turin. This object seems to have been attained
most successfully.</p>

<p>Quite recently a class has been added to the school at Ivrea for the
exclusive education of Non-commissioned Officers aspiring to a
commission; and for the sake of economy this class is to be common to
Infantry and Cavalry.</p>

<p>It is consequently from this body of officers that teachers are
derived for the topographical classes established in each Regiment or
Brigade. The Staff School having been recently founded, and a period of
active war having intervened since its institution, can not be supposed
to have completely organized its system of instruction. We have
elsewhere mentioned that Topography, the Art of War, and Fortification,
are the branches of military study most attended to; but we have reason
to believe that its plan of instruction will be extended. It may not be
superfluous to mention the high appreciation in Sardinia of the Austrian
General Staff, as tending to confirm our own estimate of the excellence
of the Austrian Staff School. We have been recently informed, on the
best authority, that some of the most distinguished Sardinian Officers,
who, from their service in the Crimea and elsewhere, have been able to
compare the merits of different Staff Corps, consider the Austrian
General Staff “the best in existence.”</p>

<p>As regards the System of Examinations, there is a Standing Board
consisting of from <i>five</i> to <i>seven</i> Officers, presided over
by a Lieutenant-General, which superintends all the more important
Examinations of the Military Schools, such as those upon leaving the
School, &amp;c. The constant Examinations within the School, when the
Cadets are being moved from one class to another, are conducted by the
Professors.</p>

<p>The expense of Military Education in the Sardinian States amounts to
18,000<i>l.</i> annually. The Military Schools are all under the
direction of the Minister of War.</p>

<p>5. Two Institutions peculiar to the Sardinian Service are the
<i>Schools for Officers</i>, one or other of which it is necessary that
every Officer under ordinary circumstances should attend for a year
before being promoted to the rank of Captain. One of these is for the
Infantry, at Ivrea; the other for the Cavalry, at Pinerol. In saying
that <i>every</i> Officer must attend these Schools, we except that
proportion of <i>one-third</i> who are promoted annually from the ranks,
and whose attendance apparently has not hitherto been required.</p>

<p>Details respecting the organization and instruction of these schools
will be found under the following heads.</p>

<h4><a name = "italy_royal" id = "italy_royal" href = "#italy">II. THE
ROYAL MILITARY ACADEMY AT TURIN.</a></h4>

<p>The <i>Accademia Militare</i> was originally designed by Charles
Emanuel, for the instruction of sons of officers of the army and of the
nobility in the use of weapons, in horsemanship, dancing, mathematics,
and belles-lettres. In the course of time, the institution was converted
to its present purpose, of training Officers for the Sardinian Army.</p>

<p>The regular course of study in this school lasts apparently for six
years, shortly to be reduced to five years, and the earliest age at
which it is <i>possible</i> now to enter is fourteen, the <i>usual</i>
age of admission being fifteen or sixteen. Formerly, boys entered at
eleven and twelve, but this practice has lately been altered, to the
regret of many Officers, who prefer the plan so commonly adopted abroad,
of training Officers to their business as soldiers from very early
years.</p>

<p>The peculiarity of this school is that during a portion of the course
it educates Officers for all Arms in common. The most talented pupils
are then selected by examination for the Artillery and Engineers, which
are the two favorite services, and indeed the most aristocratic corps in
the Sardinian army. The number of the pupils is limited to 200, but it
is rarely complete; at present there are 180 pupils. About half of these
pay for themselves a yearly sum of 1,200 francs, 48<i>l.</i>, the
remaining half are supported, or partly supported by the Government. The
system of <i>demi-bourses</i> prevails here as in France.</p>

<p>The pupils are divided into four classes, according to the years of
the course; a fifth class, contains those who have been just selected
for the Artillery and Engineers, who work by themselves, chiefly at the
higher kinds of drawing and the Differential and Integral Calculus, and
Mechanics. These senior pupils are Officers, and have each their
separate room. German is taught, and there is a Course of Italian
Literature, &amp;c., but no Latin is taught in any part of the school.
The system of working (at&nbsp;least with the higher boys) is in rooms
where eight or ten are united, and apparently there is something of the
<i>Répétiteur</i> system.</p>

<p>The arrangements of the house are excellent. The pupils appear to be
strictly confined to barracks during the week, but allowed to go out on
Sundays. The discipline is said to have been relaxed of late years, and
this is attributed by old Officers to a cause which will appear curious
in England, viz., to the pupils having <i>any</i> holidays at all. This
innovation upon the simplicity of the Piedmontese system of education
was alleged to have encouraged distinctions
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page487" id = "page487">487</a></span>
between the richer and poorer pupils, and thus to have injured both the
economy and the <i>Camaraderie</i> of the school. Great stress was laid
here, as at other Military Institutions, on a strictness of discipline
very unusual in England. The boys begin their work at half-past five
o’clock, and work till seven; then they go to chapel for a short time,
and breakfast and recreation follow immediately after. Both are
concluded by eight, when they return to their studies for an hour and a
quarter; then a quarter of an hour’s relaxation is allowed, and the
studies are resumed until eleven o’clock. An hour is then devoted to the
schools of fencing, riding, gymnastics, or dancing. From twelve to a
quarter before two o’clock is allotted to dinner and recreation, and
then another hour is spent in the fencing, riding, gymnastic, or dancing
schools. A&nbsp;quarter of an hour’s recreation is again granted, and
from three to half-past four o’clock study is resumed. A&nbsp;quarter of
an hour’s recreation follows, and half an hour is then given to military
exercises, succeeded by another quarter of an hour’s interval for rest.
Two hours are then devoted to study&mdash;from half-past five to
half-past seven o’clock. An hour is afterwards allowed for chapel,
supper, and retiring to rest.</p>

<p>A monthly account is taken of their work, and the marks then given
exercise an influence upon their places in the examinations which take
place every year.</p>

<p>The following tables give a full view of the work of the pupils
during their six years’ course.</p>

ARTILLERY AND ENGINEER SCHOOL AT TURIN.</a></h4>

<p>The <i>Artillery and Engineer School</i> (<i>Scuola
Complementaria</i>,) which is established in a large building in one of
the suburbs of Turin, is a School of Application, intended to complete
the special education of the Young Officers of the Artillery and
Engineers, which the Cadets of those Corps have previously entered upon
during their four last years in the <i>Accademia Militare</i>. Its
course of studies occupies nominally two years, but really only eighteen
months, after which the final examinations begin, and the pupils receive
leave of absence. The Students do not live in barracks here, but the
Inspector of the School seemed to think it desirable that they should do
so. The exercises of the day commence, at eight o’clock every morning,
with an hour’s riding. A&nbsp;lecture then follows, which lasts for an
hour and a half, from nine till half-past ten. The rest of the morning
is left free till twelve o’clock, when the pupils return to the school
till three, and where they study together in large classes in the same
room; they have afterwards some military exercises till five, and are
then free for the evening.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page490" id = "page490">490</a></span>
<p>The number of pupils at the school is twenty; from ten to fifteen for
the Artillery, the rest for the Engineers. The subjects of study will
show what difference exists in the studies of the two Corps, and we were
told that very little preference was shown in the choice of the Students
for one over the other. The Engineers do not appear to be at all
employed in civil works; indeed, the Government does not allow them to
be so, as there are sufficient fortifications in the kingdom of Sardinia
to afford them constant employment. The pay of the two Corps is equal,
and is very little above that of the Infantry, and the same as that of
the Cavalry. The Artillery and Engineers (the <i>Armi dotti</i>) appear
to be decidedly the favorite and aristocratic corps of the Sardinian
army. They rarely enter the Staff Corps, and the reason assigned for
this is their unwillingness to quit their own arm of the service. The
position of the pupils on entering the Corps is fixed by the Final
Examination alone, and is not influenced by marks previously given for
industry and application during the course, as is the case in some of
the French and German schools&mdash;at the Polytechnic, for instance,
and at Znaim. The only value of a high position in the Final Examination
is that it gives seniority in the Corps.</p>

<p>The direction of the school is intrusted to a Field Officer of
Artillery, assisted by two Captains, one from the Artillery, and the
other from the Engineers. His authority extends to instruction and
discipline.</p>

<p>The scientific instruction is given by professors (effective and
supplementary) and by Officers belonging to the various Artillery
divisions and establishments, who, together, constitute a Council of
Instruction, of which the Director is President.</p>

<p>The examinations to which the Officer Students are subjected are held
by a Commission, nominated by the Secretary of War.</p>


<p class = "heading"><i>Regulations respecting the Professors,
&amp;c.</i></p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>The Professors and Instructors are personally responsible for the
teaching of the subjects contained in the programmes and regulation for
the discipline of the students in School, for the daily drawing up of
the notes and execution of the drawings, and for the constant presence
of the students during the time of the instructions and lectures.</p>

<p>The Military Professors and Instructors will maintain constantly
among the students the spirit of subordination and military discipline
in all its force.</p>

<p>The Professors not possessed of military rank, when reproof is not
sufficient to keep the students to their duty, will report the matter to
the Director and to the Captains attached to the direction of the
School, in order that more vigorous measures may be adopted.</p>

<p>At the beginning of every lecture, the Professors will satisfy
themselves that the students have finished the notes preceding it, and
the regulated tasks and drawings.</p>

<p>The Professors will also have the power of visiting with arrest
students who
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page491" id = "page491">491</a></span>
are negligent in the execution of the notes and tasks, and those who
exhibit a constant indisposition to work, reporting it to the Director
of the School.</p>

<p>When the lectures are upon difficult subjects, it is the duty of the
Professors sometimes to visit the students during the hours of study,
for the purpose of explaining difficulties.</p>

<p>At the beginning of every lecture, the Professors will dictate to the
students a summary of the lesson which they are about to explain.</p>

<p>At the commencement of their course of lectures, they will point out
to the students the books and treatises to be followed.</p>

<p>At fixed intervals, as they shall judge it most convenient, the
Professors will suspend the course of their lectures to satisfy
themselves by questions of the attention given and the progress made by
the students.</p>

<p>At the opening of their course, the Professors will notify to the
Director of the School the hours which suit their engagements best for
the giving of the lectures; these hours will be subsequently maintained
unchanged throughout the duration of their course. These hours can only
be selected out of those fixed in the general time table.</p>

<p>In case of any lectures having to take place out of the lecture-rooms
of the School, they will give notice in time to the Director.</p>

<p>If they should consider any change in the programme necessary, they
will give notice in writing to the Director of the School, so that he
may be able to submit their propositions to the General Commandant.</p>

<p>The Instructors will exact of the students, in the execution of the
practical instructions and in the explanation of them, a demeanor
perfectly military, and a tone of voice appropriate to the circumstance.
All the students, without exception, should render themselves capable of
executing the practical tasks and explanations now mentioned with the
greatest perfection.</p>

<p>The Professors, as well as Instructors, in concluding their course of
lectures, will transmit to the Director of the School a statement
showing the degree of instruction acquired by the students, and their
conduct in School; the credit for the instruction and for conduct will
be given by means of two distinct integral numbers, selected from two to
ten.</p>

<h4><a name = "italy_staff" id = "italy_staff" href = "#italy">IV. THE
STAFF SCHOOL.</a></h4>

<p>The Staff School at Turin has only existed since the year 1850.
Previously to that time the Staff was supplied by picked scholars from
the <i>Accademia Militare</i>.</p>

<p>The whole Staff Corps of the Sardinian Army only consists of
thirty-six Officers, viz., twenty-four Captains, and twelve of higher
rank; no one of a lower rank than Captain being admitted even as
attached to the corps, a regulation which appeared to be considered
inconvenient.</p>

<p>Officers are required to have served four years before their
admission, as is the case in the Austrian Staff Schools, and they must
not have exceeded their twenty-eighth year. Again, as in Austria, the
Officers on leaving the school are ranged strictly in the order of
merit, as tested by a final examination; and the ablest obtain
appointments to the Staff in the same order. The Sardinian School has,
however, some peculiarities, partly arising from the higher position
which the Special Arms (<i>Armi dotti</i>) of Artillery and Engineers
hold in Sardinia than in Austria or Prussia. The method of admission is
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>An Officer requests his Colonel to recommend him for admission to the
Staff School. Great caution seems to be observed in giving this
recommendation; but having obtained it, an Officer has no further
difficulty in entering the School. In consequence of the small numbers
of the Staff Corps, the demand for entrance is not very great, and there
is accordingly no competitive examination. The numbers in the School
have, during the first five years of existence, varied
greatly&mdash;from fourteen or sixteen to four or six. A&nbsp;year
(or&nbsp;rather eleven months) is the time occupied by the studies;
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page493" id = "page493">493</a></span>
the first six months being given to theory, the last five to practice.
The time thus occupied lasts from ten till three in the afternoon.</p>

<p>The amount of knowledge required for admission into the School is
stated, in the “Note” of Colonel Petitti, to be an acquaintance with
Geometry and Algebra, as far as Equations of the Second Degree.</p>

<p>The practical work consists in the usual surveys of countries, plans,
&amp;c. The young Officers are taken by the Inspecting Colonel of the
School into the country, and worked hard for four or five months. There
have hitherto been only places for one or two of these Officers on the
Staff at the end of the year, and these (as&nbsp;has been already
mentioned) have always been the most distinguished pupils of the School.
The rest become teachers in the regimental schools. Officers leaving the
Staff School do not appear to have a right to a step immediately
(as&nbsp;in Austria) by virtue of their having been at the School; but
the Sardinian system of making all the appointments above the rank of
Major by selection gives them a prospect of advancement. Examinations
are held in the School every three months, at which the Professors give
marks of proficiency; these are combined with those obtained in the
final examinations in determining the position of the pupils.</p>

<p>The Professors in the Staff School are all military men. The building
is very good, and, although small, contains a library, instruments,
museum, and all the apparatus for maps.</p>

<p>Among the conditions which must be met favorably to be admitted to
the Royal Staff Corps are the following:&mdash;</p>

<p class = "continue"><i>Physique:</i>&mdash;</p>

<h4><a name = "italy_regiment" id = "italy_regiment" href = "#italy">V.
REGIMENTAL SCHOOLS OF IVREA AND PINEROL.</a></h4>

<p>The requirement of professional study from Officers after entrance
into the Army is a point almost peculiar to the Sardinian service. The
<i>principle</i> of the Prussian Division School is, indeed, almost the
same as that of the two Schools we are about to describe; but the
examination for which the Division Schools prepare is a qualification
for obtaining a commission, and not (like that of the Sardinian Schools)
for subsequent promotion. And this difference is partly owing to an
obvious cause, the slowness of promotion in the Prussian Service. If the
Division Schools and their examination were placed before the promotion
to a Captaincy, the candidates attending the School would be in most
cases nearly forty years of age.</p>

<p>Some instruction in Topography is given to the Officers of every
Regiment in the Sardinian Army, under the direction of the Chief of the
Staff of the Division. Care is taken to render the teaching uniform
throughout the Army, and it may be considered as a preparation for the
more systematic instruction given in the Schools of Ivrea and Pinerol.
The former of these is intended for the Infantry; the latter for the
Cavalry. Every Officer, excepting those of the Special Arms, must have
passed a year of study in one or other of these Schools, as well as a
subsequent examination, before he can obtain a Captaincy.</p>

<p>The studies are mainly practical, as may be seen from the “Prospectus
of Instruction” annexed. Topography, Field Fortification, and Secondary
Operations are the only branches of Military Science
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page495" id = "page495">495</a></span>
in which instruction is given; and upon these much care appears to be
bestowed.</p>

<p>One-third of the Officers of the Sardinian Army are promoted, as has
been mentioned, from the ranks. Accordingly, a class has been recently
added to the School of Ivrea, intended exclusively for the Education of
those Non-commissioned Officers who aspire to a Commission. This class
is to be common to Infantry and Cavalry.</p>

<p>The following extracts from the Regulations of the Minister of War,
will exhibit the practical character of instruction in this class of
schools.</p>

<p class = "heading"><i>Prospectus of Instruction to be given to
Lieutenants in the Military School of Infantry</i>.</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>Soldiers’ Drill, Squad, Company, Battalion, and Chasseur ditto,
&amp;c.</p>
<p>Fencing with the Bayonet.</p>
<p>Exercise of the various Arms, &amp;c.</p>
<p>Musketry Practice.</p>
<p>Regulations of Discipline, Garrison and Field Regulations, Army
Accounts.</p>
<p>Secondary Operations of War.</p>
<p>Topography.</p>
<p>Field Fortification.</p>
</div>


<p class = "heading"><i>School of Topography.</i></p>

<p>It is decided that such instruction [in Topography,] shall take place
from the commencement of March till the end of July.</p>

<p>This will be obligatory on Officers who have not passed the age of
thirty years.</p>

<p>Those Corps, however, who may think that they can thus employ
themselves in the winter also for the hour or so which may remain over
after the other occupations of the Officers, shall have the power of
establishing, from the beginning of November, a school, in which drawing
and other preliminary acquirements may be taught.</p>

<p>This School will be attended especially by beginners and the less
educated, who will thus be able better to profit at the beginning of
March by the lectures given to the Officers more advanced in this
study.</p>

<p>The Schools will be instituted for regiments or brigades, according
as the General commanding the Division shall determine, upon the report
of the Chief of the Staff, regard being had to the Director who can be
assigned to them and the opportunities afforded by the situation.</p>

<p>In cases, however, where it may be convenient, they can institute
Divisional Schools as well, which will be attended by the Officers of
the different corps already more advanced in the study.</p>

<p>There they will be exercised, by direction of the Chief of the
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page496" id = "page496">496</a></span>
Staff, in the various subjects taught in the School, especially in the
application upon sketches of themes of secondary operations of war, and
will be taken into the field to execute surveys on the spot with the
instruments and by the eye.</p>

<p>In this case, in the Regimental Schools, the less educated officers
will be trained under the direction of Officers who have given proof of
sufficient capacity.</p>

<p>The Officers of the Detachments of Cavalry or of the Rifles, for whom
it may not be convenient to establish separate schools, will attend
those schools of their garrison to which they are assigned by the
General Commandant of the Division upon the proposition of the Chief of
the Staff.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as this Ministry is careful to provide the Schools of
Topography with the instruments necessary for the practical training
upon the ground, it makes known henceforward the implements with which
they must be provided, at the charge of the Treasury, in cases where
they do not already possess them, viz.:&mdash;</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>Small tables, with desks. Seats or stools. Slate, with stand. 2
pieces of Indian ink. 2 ditto of French blue. 2 ditto of gum. 2 tablets
of carded wool. 1 case of mathematical instruments. 2 plane rulers of
one metre each, besides some rulers of various dimensions, the necessary
paper for themes, &amp;c. 2 pen-knives. Some pencils. 1 paper of steel
pens for drawing. Half a bundle of crows’-quills. Chalk for the slate,
and sponge. Inkstand, with ordinary ink. 2 crayons (<i>coulé</i>) of No.
2. 2 ditto of No. 4. 2 pieces of Indian rubber.</p>


<p class = "smallhead">GENERAL SYLLABUS OF INSTRUCTION FOR THE INFANTRY
OF THE LINE.</p>

<p class = "heading"><i>Months of November, December, January, February
and March.</i></p>

<p>Recruits will be kept separate from the seniors during these five
months in all the instructions (except the drills.)</p>

<p>They will be instructed progressively once a day in soldiers’ and
squad drill.</p>

<p>They will attend daily the gymnastic exercise and the school of
reading and writing.</p>

<p>N.B. As they shall progress by degrees in the various branches of
instruction, they will take their part in the service, at first on duty
where arms are not required, and afterwards with their arms, as much as
possible always upon public holidays.</p>

<p>Seniors will have to attend the school of reading, writing,
arithmetic, and gymnastics daily.</p>

<p>The recruits as well as the seniors will be prepared for the practice
range, during the months of February and March, by aiming at the butt
and firing at the candle.</p>

<p>The Officers, especially the juniors, will be encouraged to exercise
themselves in gymnastics, and to frequent the School of Topography.</p>

<p>The Captains will be taught riding as much as possible where they are
in garrison with Cavalry.</p>

<p>In the months of February and March the Officers will be further
prepared in the appropriate theory, with a view to the instruction of
the following months, and all without exception will have to practice
firing with the rifle.</p>


<p class = "heading"><i>April and May.</i></p>

<p>There will be no further distinction made between the recruits and
seniors.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page497" id = "page497">497</a></span>
<p>They will pass successively through soldiers’, squad, and company
drill, bayonet exercise, and rifle practice at the butt.</p>

<p>The school of reading, writing, and arithmetic, and gymnastics, will
be continued at least for the lower classes.</p>

<p>The Captains will give instruction to their companies, especially in
bad weather, on the subject of packing necessaries, and on the general
behavior of the soldier under different circumstances on and off duty,
showing them also the manner of making reports in a few clear and
concise words.</p>

<p>The Officers will be prepared by the appropriate theoretical training
for the instruction of the following months.</p>

<p>The School of Topography will be continued as much as possible for
the Officers who desire to attend it.</p>


<p class = "heading"><i>June, July, August.</i></p>

<p>They will pass successively through battalion drill and regimental
and brigade manœuvres.</p>

<p>The rifle practice at the butt will be continued.</p>

<p>The <i>Chasseur</i> exercise will be taught.</p>

<p>The swimming school will proceed with the utmost possible
activity.</p>

<p>The school of reading, writing, and arithmetic, and gymnastics will
be continued at least for the lowest classes, as much at least as the
instructions in other subjects, and especially swimming, permit.</p>

<p>The Generals of Brigade will explain theoretically to the superior
Officers and Captains, and these latter to their own companies, the
nature of service in the field.</p>


<p class = "heading"><i>September.</i></p>

<p>By frequent marches instruction will be given in field service,
practical in its nature, and separate for every arm.</p>

<p>Manœuvres and evolutions appropriate to the ground will be gone
through.</p>

<p>The troops will be disposed for the defense of a village or a
position, of a stream, or the like.</p>


<p class = "heading"><i>October.</i></p>

<p>The instruction in the field will continue as much as possible, and
especially in the garrisons where troops of different arms are
quartered, one part of the force can be opposed to the other, and, where
the service of the place permits it, by calling in the assistance of the
National Guard, the garrison will be able entirely or in part to absent
itself for two or three days.</p>


<p class = "smallhead">GENERAL RULES RELATING TO THE INSTRUCTIONS.</p>

<p>1. As far as is possible the soldiers should receive at least two
lessons in the day.</p>

<p>2. In the months of April, May, June, July, and August, the drill in
the <i>place d’ armes</i> will take place only once a day, the other
will be in the barrack or the neighborhood.</p>

<p>3. The Officers should give the instructions themselves, and should
never appear as idle spectators before the soldier.</p>

<p>The subalterns will themselves conduct the soldiers’ and squad drill,
and the bayonet exercise.</p>

<p>The Captains will be careful to instruct their own companies. At the
rifle practice all the Officers of the Company should be present and
interest themselves for the good working of so important a subject of
instruction.</p>

<p>4. During recreation times, and in all those kinds of instruction
which do not require silence and immobility, the Officers will be
careful to converse with their inferiors, and to study their character
and qualities, praising and encouraging the good to do well, and
visiting with words of blame more or less severe those who are
ill-regulated in their conduct.</p>

<p>5. In order to interrupt as little as possible the course of the
instructions, the Colonels and Generals of Brigade will avail themselves
of the festivals accurately to review the men before and after mass.</p>

<p>6. In forts the Infantry will be exercised at the service of guns
according to
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page498" id = "page498">498</a></span>
the directions which will be given to the Officers of Artillery
commanding in them.</p>

<p>7. Some Non-commissioned Officers in every regiment will be trained
as the carpenters for making cartridges.</p>

<p>8. In the interior of the barracks the men will be encouraged to
amuse themselves, and be gay, rather than to loiter about in idleness.
It will be most advantageous to introduce singing to music, as was done
in the camp of 1846.</p>

<p>9. In the month of August, Staff Officers will be dispatched to the
principal garrisons who, being attached to Generals of Brigade and
Division, will prepare with them the projects and plans for the field
instructions of the months of September and October. These Staff
Officers are further particularly charged to study the environs, and to
point out in reports for that purpose the most important military
positions, and the mode of occupying them.</p>

<p>10. Appropriate instructions concerning the rules to be observed in
the rifle schools, concerning the swimming school, and the exercises in
the field, will be forwarded at the proper time.</p>

a colleague and a military council. The office of Master of Ordnance is
generally filled by a grand prince. The regular force, or army of
occupation consists of about 783,000 men, which can be easily swelled to
at least 1,200,000, as the whole male population are liable to serve
when summoned. The army is mainly recruited by conscription, which falls
on the serfs and laboring population, as the nobility, officials, clergy
and merchants are exempted. The term of service is twenty years for the
guards, <ins class = "correction"
title = "hyphen invisible">twenty-two</ins> for the line, and twenty-five for the train
and military servants. But few pensions are granted to discharged or
furloughed soldiers, although veteran soldiers are frequently appointed
to situations as doorkeepers, watchmen, overseers, &amp;c., in
government establishments and public institutions.</p>

<p>Promotion by seniority, imperial favor, and good conduct on the
field. Every officer must be educated and trained to his business, and
serve from the lowest to the highest rank. Non-commissioned officers,
musicians, assistant veterinary surgeons, head workmen in the military
workshops and factories must all be trained for their special duties.
A&nbsp;large portion of these classes are the sons of soldiers, who have
been surrendered by their parents to the government, who receive them at
the age of six or twelve, by special arrangement. They are termed
<i>cantonists</i>. Among the special military schools of a technological
character are, eleven for garrison artillery; three for armories; three
for powder mills; three for arsenals; one for riding masters; one for
fencing; one for accountants; one for topographical drawing, &amp;c.</p>

MILITARY SCHOOL FOR OFFICERS.</a></h4>

<p>The officers of the Russian army obtain their first commission after
passing through the Military Schools or Cadet Corps, or if qualified in
scientific and other instruction, ascertained by open examination, by
serving as privates six months, and as sergeants or ensign two years.
Applicants for the Staff Corps, must have served as officers two years,
must be recommended by their superior, and have been two years in the
Staff School&mdash;and there pass an honorable examination in military
history and strategy. The following statistics are taken from the

<p><span class = "firstword">A Military</span> Academy, the highest
institution of its class, is founded in St. Petersburg, to educate
Officers for the service of the General Staff, and to promote the
diffusion of Military Science in general. Its special functions
are&mdash;</p>

<p>1. To prepare Officers for the special service of the General
Staff.</p>

<p>2. To furnish to a certain number of Officers from the Artillery and
Chief Engineer School a course of Grand Tactics and Strategy, on the
same principles and to the same extent as it is furnished to the
Officers preparing for the Service of the General Staff.</p>

<p>3. To apply all the means indicated in these Regulations to the
diffusion of Military Science.</p>

<p>From forty to fifty Officers shall be educated in the Academy for the
special service of the General Staff, and about ten from the Artillery
and from the Chief Engineer School.</p>

<p>The Military Academy is under the immediate control of the Chief of
the Staff of His Imperial Majesty, and is under the direction of a
President appointed by the Emperor.</p>

<p>A Council, presided over by the President, considers and determines
all important questions relating to Studies and Economic
Administration.</p>

<p>A Vice-President, appointed by the Emperor, is associated with the
President to assist him in the performance of his official duties.</p>

<p>The Officers receiving an education for the General Staff are placed
under the control of four Staff Officers appointed by the Emperor.</p>

<p>The subjects of Study and the Scientific Course are divided into two
Sections, the Theoretical and the Practical.</p>

<p>The number of Professors, Adjuncts, and Teachers is determined
according to circumstances by the Academic Council, with the approbation
of the Chief of the Staff of his Imperial Majesty.</p>

<p>The Salaries of the Officials for the internal service of the Academy
are fixed in the List annexed to these Statutes.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page506" id = "page506">506</a></span>
<p>It is the most sacred duty of the whole Staff of the Academy, and in
particular of the Chiefs and Professors, never to lose sight of its
object; and while they devote themselves to extend the knowledge of the
student Officers, to impress upon them, by teaching and example, the
precepts of the purest morality, the true and exact performance of their
professional duties, an unconditional obedience to their superiors, and
an inviolable devotion to the throne and their country.</p>

<p>The Academy has a peculiar Seal.</p>


<h5><a name = "russia_petersburg_admission" id =

TO STUDENTS.</a></h5>

<p>Only Superior Officers can enter into the Academy, and these up to
the rank of Staff Captain if they serve in the Guards, Artillery, or
Engineers; up to the rank of Captain, if they belong to an Army
Regiment.</p>

<p>The Directors of the Noble Guard School, of the Page Corps, of the
First, Second, Pant, Moscow, and Finland Cadet Corps, have the right to
propose in the proper quarter, for admission into the Academy, the most
distinguished Officers who have left these military institutions.</p>

<p>The Officers proposed for admission into the Academy must be at least
eighteen years old, and be distinguished for capacity, industry,
diligence, morals, and good conduct.</p>

<p>Officers from the Regiments and Artillery Brigades must present
testimonials of blameless morals, conduct, and zeal for the Service from
the Chief of their Division. Officers from the Engineer Battalions must
present similar testimonials from the Chiefs of their Brigades.</p>

<p>Those who give testimonials are strictly responsible for their truth,
as are the Chiefs of the Military Schools for the capacity and
qualifications of the Officers they propose.</p>

<p>Admission into the Academy depends upon a strict examination in the
following subjects:&mdash;</p>

href = "#russia_petersburg">III. METHOD OF INSTRUCTION.</a></h5>

<p>The Scientific Course is divided into two Sections,&mdash;The
Theoretical and the Practical. The Theoretical part of the higher
Military Sciences is expounded by the Professors, their Adjuncts, and
the Teachers. Those Officers who belong to the Practical Section
exercise themselves under the guidance of the Professors.</p>

<div class = "inlist">
<p><i>a.</i> In Written Exercises on any proposed Military Subject.</p>

<p><i>b.</i> In the composition of Military Descriptions
(<i>Beschreibungen</i>,) of every kind.</p>

<p><i>c.</i> In the Art of taking Military Surveys of a Country, and of
judging the Tactical Nature of a Ground.</p>
</div>

<p>In each Section there are from twenty to twenty-five Officers
destined for the Service of the General Staff, and from four to five
from the Artillery and Chief Engineer School.</p>

<p>These Officers, according to their capacities and attainments in the
Military Sciences, enter either into the Theoretical Section or into
both the Theoretical and the Practical Section at the same time, and
remain in each a year.</p>

<p>The complete Academic Course in both Sections extends over two
years.</p>

<p>The following subjects are taught:&mdash;</p>

<div class = "inlist">
<p><i>a.</i> Russian literature, with particular reference to the
composition of Military Essays in a faultless style, and to the style of
the Military Chancery (writing department of the War Office.)</p>

<p><i>b.</i> General ideas on Artillery, and more precise details on the
same subject as a Special Arm; its use in the open field and in
sieges.</p>

<p><i>c.</i> Petty Tactics in the employment of a single Division, with
which all Officers must be thoroughly familiar, as this is indispensable
to all. To this is joined the theory of the formation of columns, of
their use, of the effect of the fire of Infantry, and lastly, the
explanation of all evolutions with the three arms which are usually
employed for movement, deployment, or forming in order of battle.</p>

<p><i>d.</i> The Elements of Topography and Geodesy, of Military

view of the Military History of modern times.</p>

<p><i>o.</i> The literary History of the Military Sciences, with a
criticism on the best ancient and modern writers on the History of War;
and a special reference of those who may contribute to the further

<p><i>p.</i> Duties of the General Staff Officer in times both of peace
and war.</p>

<p><i>q.</i> The art of riding.</p>
</div>

<p>The officers of the Practical Division are employed on the same
Sciences; not, however, during the hours of lecture, but by practicing
under the direction of the Professors, and according to the regulations
of the Academic authorities.</p>

<p>The subjects they are employed upon are principally the
following:&mdash;</p>

<div class = "inlist">
<p><i>a.</i> Topographical and Tactical description of ground after
inspection.</p>

<p><i>b.</i> Military Geography and Statistics.</p>

<p><i>c.</i> Logistic.</p>

<p><i>d.</i> Grand Tactics.</p>

<p><i>i.</i> Historic reports, and keeping the usual journal of the
General Staff.</p>

<p><i>j.</i> All that belong to the survey of a country, and the
practical working of the Artillery and Siege operations.</p>
</div>

<p>Teachers are appointed for those officers who require to be perfected
in the French or German language.</p>

<p>All the sciences are taught in the Academy in the Russian language;
and an exposition in French or German is only allowed when dictated by
circumstances, and then a special permission must be first obtained from
the Chief of the Staff of his Imperial Majesty.</p>

<p>The Officers of the Practical Section are also required to use their
native tongue in their written exercises, except in one or two composed
in a foreign language by the direction of the authorities.</p>

<p>In summer, the Officers of the Theoretical Section repair to
regiments to which they are directed to learn the camp service. The
Officers of the Practical Section make surveys and reconnaissances,
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page509" id = "page509">509</a></span>
mark out camps and proportionate intrenchments on a given ground. At the
time of grand manœuvres, they are associated with Officers of the
General Staff, and have the opportunity of witnessing the practical
exercises of the Artillery and Sappers, in order to be able to make a
report as eye-witnesses on the effect of Artillery and Siege
operations.</p>


<h5><a name = "russia_petersburg_local" id = "russia_petersburg_local"
href = "#russia_petersburg">IV. LOCAL REGULATIONS.</a></h5>

<p>All Officers receiving an education in the Academy are entered on the
rolls of their Regiments, Artillery Brigades, and Sapper Battalions, as
supernumeraries and detached Officers, without, however, losing their
standing or right of promotion by seniority, their pay, servants’
rations, or any other advantages enjoyed by Officers present with their
troop.</p>

<p>Those Officers who enter the Academy from the Regiments of the
Garrison of St. Petersburg continue, while they belong to it, to perform
the front service of their Regiments; those who come from the Artillery
and Sapper Brigades, or from Regiments not stationed in St. Petersburg,
are attached for the front service to one of the Regiments of the
Garrison of St. Petersburg; the necessary arrangements are made by the
authorities of the Guard Corps.</p>

<p>The Officers of the Artillery and Chief Engineer School, having only
to attend the Course of Grand Tactics and Strategy, retain their posts
while studying in the Academy.</p>

<p>Four Staff Officers, appointed by the Emperor, have the immediate
control of the Officers preparing themselves for the service of the
General Staff; they are to exercise a vigilant supervision over them,
and to report on their conduct to the Vice-President; they are the organ
by which all orders reach the Officers, and they form a Court of the
First Instance in matters relating to the Service.</p>

<p>One day in the week is devoted to drill, and every day two officers
mount guard with the first division of the garrison of St.
Petersburg.</p>

<p>The Officers are to devote exclusively to study the leisure hours at
their command after the performance of front and garrison duties; and
are to observe, in all respects, the Statutes of the Academy.</p>

<p>To facilitate, economically, the residence of the Officers in St.
Petersburg, they receive, with the exception of those belonging to the
Guard, besides their usual pay and an allowance for quarters according
to their rank, an annual allowance of 500 roubles, which is paid in the
Academy.</p>

<p>Officers ordered to survey a country, or to make a reconnaissance,
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page510" id = "page510">510</a></span>
receive their traveling expenses from the Commissariat, according to the
distance to which they are sent, and in proportion to their rank: their
board expenses are not allowed.</p>


<h5><a name = "russia_petersburg_promotion" id =

RESPECTING PROMOTION.</a></h5>

<p>The course is terminated, and Students finish their career, in
October annually.</p>

<p>At the same time, Officers are removed from the Theoretical section
to the Practical, making place for candidates who wish to enter the
former.</p>

<p>At their departure from the Academy the Officers receive from the
Academic Council testimonials of conduct and scientific attainments,
with a memorial of the rewards which they receive at leaving.</p>

<p>On leaving the Academy the Officers have to act as follows: those who
belonged to the Artillery, or Chief Engineer School, repair to their
highest Commanding Officer; the rest, who were educated for the service
of the General Staff, return to their Regiments, Artillery Brigades, or
Sapper Battalions, on whose rolls they remain as supernumeraries and
Officers reckoned as of the General Staff, until they are formally
transferred to the latter.</p>

<p>The rewards to which Officers can acquire a claim at leaving the
Academy are the following:&mdash;The most distinguished is promoted to
the lowest rank (on&nbsp;the Staff,) and receives a golden medal; he is
only entitled to this if all the teachers give him the full number
balls, and unanimously recognize him as most conspicuous for
attainments. Besides this, he must have written a satisfactory essay on
a given theme, relating to some important war, and have been blameless
in moral conduct during his residence in the Academy. The student who is
recognized as second, both in attainments and behavior, and has also
obtained the full number of balls, is rewarded with the great silver
medal, and receives double pay for a year. The student who obtains the
third place in attainments and behavior, and the full number of balls,
receives the little silver medal, and double pay for a year. Each medal
bears the name of its possessor. Besides this, the names of all those
who obtain one of the three above-mentioned rewards are engraved on
marble tablets, which adorn the walls of one of the halls of the
Academic building.</p>

<p>Should any of the Students feel no inclination for the service of the
General Staff, even after a successful termination of the Theoretical
Course, he may always request to be dismissed to his Regiment, Artillery
Brigade, or Sapper Battalion.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page511" id = "page511">511</a></span>
<p>Every Officer who at his departure from the Academy obtains a
testimonial of having accomplished the object of his admission, and in
consequence is provisionally destined for the service of the General
Staff, if he continues after his return to his Regiment to educate
himself for his vocation, and distinguishes himself by observance of a
strict discipline, by conduct and zeal for the service, is rewarded at
the end of a year by being completely transferred to the General Staff;
and if he belonged to the Young Guard, the Artillery, or a Sapper
Battalion, his right to promotion immediately commences; not so if he
belonged to Troops of the Line.</p>

<p>Every year, on the 1st of January, the Chief of the Regiment,
Artillery Brigade, or Sapper Battalion in command of an Officer reckoned
as of the General Staff, forwards his form and his conduct list to the
Quartermaster-General of the General Staff, who lays it before the Chief
of the General Staff. At the same time the above-mentioned papers are
communicated to the Chief in command of the Officer.</p>

<p>Besides this, the above-mentioned Chief makes a similar report on the
zeal for the service and moral conduct of the Officers twice a year,
namely, on the 1st of March and the 1st of September; and at the same
time reports exactly on the way in which he performs the service of the
front.</p>

<p>No Officer reckoned as of the General Staff is to be charged with the
duties of Paymaster service in his Regiment, or employed as
Quartermaster; and if any General wishes to select him for his Adjutant,
he must first communicate with the Quartermaster-General of the General
Staff.</p>

<p>If the General Staff is increased in time of war, or if any work on
which it is employed requires to be accelerated in time of peace, the
Chief of the General Staff commissions the Quartermaster-General to
select the requisite number out of the Officers who are reckoned as of
the General Staff. The latter then makes the selection, and announces
the names of the Officers selected to their highest Commanding Officer.
As soon as the object proposed is accomplished, these Officers return
back to their commands. Such a selection, however, can only fall upon
those who have spent at least two years with their commands after their
departure from the Academy. If in the meantime an Officer has become
Chief of a Battalion or Squadron, he shall not be transferred from this
post before the lapse of a year. As soon as any of these Officers, or,
in general, any Officer, who has left the Academy, reports himself at
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page512" id = "page512">512</a></span>
his Corps, his Chief immediately announces his arrival to the
Quartermaster-General of the Staff.</p>

<p>To familiarize the Officers reckoned of the General Staff with the
rules of the Art of War while they remain with their commands, and to
practice them in the duties which belong to Officers of the General
Staff, the Quartermaster-General is directed to charge them with such
duties as may develop their talent, without, however, removing them for
that purpose from the service of the front. These commissions of the
Quartermaster-General are communicated through their superior Officers,
who are directed not only to watch over their performance of these
commissions, but also to assist them therein to the utmost of their
power.</p>

MILITARY SYSTEM.</a></h4>

<p><span class = "firstword">The</span> Swedish army is composed,
according to official data in Martin’s Year Book, of five distinct
classes of troops, viz.:</p>

<p>1. The <i>Indelta</i>, or national militia, paid and kept, not by the
Government, but by the landowners, and, to some extent, from the income
of State domains expressly reserved for this purpose. Every soldier of
the <i>Indelta</i> has, besides a small annual pay, his <i>torp</i>, or
cottage, with a piece of ground attached, which remains his own during
the whole period of service, often extending over forty years, or even
longer. In time of peace, the troops of the <i>Indelta</i> are not
called up for more than a month’s annual practice, and for the rest of
the year are free from military duty. In time of war, an extraordinary
<i>Indelta</i> has to be raised by landowners, who, on this account,
enjoy certain privileges, including non-contribution to the cost of the
peace establishment. When the soldier dies, his widow turns over the
holding to his successor, whom the owner of the land is bound to provide
within three months. In the location of the officers, regard is had to
the situation of the men who compose the company, regiment, and larger
divisions.</p>

<p>2. The <i>Beväring</i>, or conscription troops, drawn by annual levy,
from the male population between the age of 20 and 25 years. The law of
conscription, which admits the right of purchasing substitutes, was
introduced into Sweden in 1812. About 19,000 men are drafted annually,
one-tenth of which number, on the average, find substitutes for
themselves, at a cost of from 10<i>l.</i> to 25<i>l.</i></p>

<p>3. The <i>Värfvade</i>, or enlisted troops, to which belong the royal
life-guards, the hussars, the engineers, and the artillery. The men may
engage for either three, or six, or twelve years; but the greater number
are for six years, peculiar inducements being held out for this
term.</p>

<p>4. The volunteers, first organized in the year 1861, by the
spontaneous desire of the population of the kingdom. In time of peace
the volunteers are individually free, and bound by no other but their
own rules and regulations: but in time of war they may be
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page514" id = "page514">514</a></span>
compelled to place themselves under the command of the military
authorities.</p>

<p>5. The militia of Gothland, consisting of twenty-one companies of
infantry, organized in a similar manner to the <i>Indelta</i>, yet quite
independent of the latter. They are not compelled by law to serve beyond
the confines of the Isle of Gothland, and have a separate command from
the other troops.</p>

<p>The armed forces of Sweden, not counting the Volunteers, consist
altogether of&mdash;</p>

<p>In the organization of the army, as here enumerated, 85,000 men
belong to the infantry of the line; 6,000 to the cavalry; 5,000 to the
artillery, and the rest to the irregular militia. The number of
volunteers was returned at 40,848 in 1869, but about one-third of these
formed part also of the <i>Indelta</i>. In the parliamentary session of
1862, and again in the sessions of 1865 and 1869, the Government brought
bills before the Diet for a reorganization of the whole of the army, on
the basis of extending the conscription, reforming the <i>Indelta</i>,
and doing away, to a great extent, with the <i>Värfvade</i>. But neither
of these propositions was adopted by the representatives of the people,
whose habits are not easily set aside.</p>


<p class = "heading"><i>Navy.</i></p>

<p>The Navy of Sweden was reorganized in 1866-67, being divided into two
distinct parts; the first to serve as an ordinary fleet of war for
aggressive as well as defensive purposes, and the second stationary, and
solely devoted to coast defense. It consisted in 1869 of&mdash;</p>

<p>The iron-clads are built after the American model; one a turret ship,
called the “John Ericsson,” is partly covered with steel armor. There
were 6,453 sailors and marines in active service, and 28,000 men were on
furlough or attached to the fleet of reserve and coast defense.</p>

<p>The expenditure for the army in 1869 was 9,528,600 <i>riks
dalers</i>, and for the navy 3,963,800. The indebtedness of the state is
about $41,000,000, mostly contracted in aid of a system of railways.</p>

<p><span class = "firstword">The</span> armed forces of Norway, as
organized by law in 1866, consisted in 1869 of the following:</p>

<p>1. The regular army, with reserve, raised partly by conscription and
partly by enlistment, which must never exceed 12,000 men in time of
peace, and can not be increased above 18,000 men without the special
consent of the Storthing. The average number in time of peace for ten
years past, is about 6,000. The term of service is seven years, but the
men are on duty only 42 days in the first year, and this past, they are
sent home on furloughs, with an obligation to meet for annual practice
of 24 days during the following six years.</p>

<p>2. The Militia or <i>Landvaern</i>, which consists of all able-bodied
male citizens 18 years of age, who for three years must, at stated
periods, be trained in the use of arms and field exercises, and at the
end of this time, be enrolled in</p>

<p>3. The final Levy, or <i>Landstorm</i>, where he is liable to be
called out in time of war, until he is 45 years of age.</p>

<p>The normal strength of the armed forces of Norway in 1869 was
returned at 47,714 on a peace footing, and 112,225 on a war footing, and
required an appropriation of 1,215,500 <i>specie dalers</i>, making the
cost of the Norwegian soldier (on&nbsp;the average of 6,000 men under
arms), $155 per annum.</p>

<p>The King has permission to keep a guard of Norwegian volunteers, and
to transfer, for the purposes of common military exercises, 3,000 men
annually to Sweden; otherwise a soldier of Norway can not set foot in
Sweden; or one of Sweden, in Norway.</p>

<p>The naval force consists of 20 vessels, of 2,280 horse-power, and 168
guns, manned by 2,248 sailors, who are volunteers out of 60,000 men in
the maritime conscription, which includes all seafaring men of the
seaports, between the ages of 22 and 35.</p>

<p>Three of the vessels are iron-clad monitors.</p>

<p>In order to utilize the vessels of the navy they are attached to the
postal service, and are employed in carrying the mails and passengers,
under a special minister, charged with the mail service. The navy and
post service cost in 1869, 1,172,815 <i>speciedalers</i>.</p>

<p>1. The Regular or active army, and&mdash;2. The army of Reserve.</p>

<p>By the law of 1867, every male citizen who has completed the age of
21, is liable to service for eight years in the former, and to be
enrolled ready for special call for eight years more in the latter.</p>

<p>The Kingdom is divided into five territorial brigades, and each
brigade in four territorial battalions, in such way that no town except
the capital, will belong to more than one battalion. Each territorial
brigade furnishes the contingent of a brigade of infantry and one
regiment of cavalry. The artillery contingent is furnished, one half by
the two first territorial brigades, and the second half by the three
other divisions. The forces therefrom comprise 20 battalions of infantry
of the line, with 10 depot battalions and 10 of reserve; 5 regiments of
cavalry, each with 2 squadrons active, and 2 depots; and 2 regiments of
artillery, in 12 battalions. The total strength of the army, exclusive
of the reserve, is 36,782 rank and file, with 1,068 officers, on the
peace footing, and 47,725 men, and 1,328 officers on the war footing.
About one half of the enrolled regular army are usually on furlough. The
drilling is divided into two periods; the first lasts six months for the
infantry; five months for the field artillery and the engineers; nine
months and two weeks for the cavalry; and four months for the siege
artillery and the technic corps. Each corps must drill each year during
thirty to forty days.</p>

<p>The navy comprises the following vessels, all steamers:</p>

<p>Six <i>iron-clads</i>, with an aggregate of 2,455 horse-power, and
with 65 guns&mdash;two of which are turreted, armed each with two of
Armstrong rifled cannon; 12 <i>unarmored vessels</i> of 1,820
horse-power, and with 192 guns; 7 gun-boats of 480 horse-power and 38
guns; 6 paddle-steamers, of 1,060 horse-power and 38 guns. The navy in
1869 was manned by 901 men, and officered by 15 commanders, 34 captains,
and 67 lieutenants.</p>

<p>The budget for 1869 provided 3,783,978 <i>rigsdalers</i> for the

"#switzerland">1. OUTLINE OF MILITARY SYSTEM.</a></h4>

<p><span class = "firstword">In</span> the year 1847 seven of the
cantons of the Swiss Republic seceded from the Confederacy. Among them
were the three forest cantons, the original nucleus around which the
whole Republic had been formed, the birth-place of William Tell and
Arnold, of Winkelreid. The seceders held the strongest military position
in Europe, but the loyal cantons put on foot an army of 100,000 men,
well armed, drilled, and officered. The city of Friburg was taken, and
in thirty days from the first proclamation of the commanding general the
war was ended and order was restored.</p>

<p>In 1856, a quarrel having arisen with the king of Prussia,
Switzerland placed on foot an army of 200,000 men well provided with
<ins class = "correction" title = ". invisible">artillery.</ins> Thus
the military system of Switzerland has proved itself effective; and as
there is no standing army whatever, and the state is a confederacy of
cantons under democratic forms of government, we may find something in
their system applicable to our own case.</p>

<p><a name = "switzerland_area" id = "switzerland_area">Switzerland
covers an area</a> of about 15,000 square miles, equal to that of
Vermont and New Hampshire together, of which a large portion is covered
by lakes, forests, mountains, ice and snow, leaving only thirty-one per
cent of the land fit for agricultural purposes, not including the
mountain pastures. Possessing a population of only two millions and a
half of people, it is surrounded by military powers of the first class,
and must needs be strong to be free. France, Austria, and Prussia are
not always as good friends as they are near neighbors, and the little
Republic must ever be ready to ward a blow and return it. The
constitution of Switzerland declares that every citizen is a soldier.
“Tout Suisse est soldat.” Military service is required between the ages
of twenty and forty-four. The substitution of one man for another is
forbidden, but exemption from service is allowed to certain persons,
such as officers of the government and of public institutions,
clergymen, students of theology, members of the police, pilots and
others. In some cases a man is excused from the more active service, but
required to pass through the regular course of military
<span class = "pagenum">

instruction and to serve in the reserve of the army when called upon.
Such are the only son, or one of the sons, of a widow; or of a widower,
provided the father be over sixty years old, and the son necessary to
his support; a widower, the father of children in their minority, who
has no resources except the work of his own hands; one of two or more
sons when they make common household with their parents, if the family
could not be supported by other brothers not subject to service; married
men, or widowers having at least two children. These exceptions do not
apply to officers.</p>

<p>The Council of State of each canton appoints yearly a “Commission on
Furlough and Discharge,” consisting of ten members, of whom two are
medical men, two officers, one a corporal, one a soldier, and the others
members of the council. The commission acts under oath; grants exemption
for physical defects or want of height; or passes men from the active
service to the reserve. A&nbsp;man who at the age of twenty has not
attained the height of five feet and one inch can be furloughed for two
years; and if, at the end of the third year, he has not reached this
height, discharged from all service. Men who have been convicted of
disgraceful crimes, or have suffered penal sentence, are declared
unworthy of bearing arms; and if once deprived of their civil rights can
not hold a commission.</p>

<p><a name = "switzerland_militia" id = "switzerland_militia">The
militia</a> is divided into the federal contingent and the landwehr. The
federal contingent consists&mdash;<i>First</i>, of the elite, which
includes three per cent of the whole population, taken from those
between the ages of twenty and thirty-four. The time of service in the
elite is eight years. <i>Second</i>, the reserve, being one and a half
per cent of the population and not above the age of forty. The landwehr
includes men up to the age of forty-four. The landsturm, or <i>levy en
masse</i>, consists of the whole male population, capable of bearing
arms, between the ages of twenty and fifty, and not included in the
classes before described. The male population of Switzerland is
1,140,000, of which thirty-seven per cent, or 422,000, are between
twenty and forty-four years of age. One-fourth of these are exempt or
found unfit for service, leaving 316,000 perfectly fit. In 1853 the
number of men required for the federal contingent was 104,354,<a class =
"tag" name = "tag9_1" id = "tag9_1" href = "#note9_1">1</a> but
according to official statements the number of men in all branches of
the service, well armed and instructed, amounted to 125,126. The excess
of men supplied, over those required, arose from the public spirit and
general desire for military instruction existing among the people. Add
to these 125,000 the landwehr, which numbered 150,000, and we have a
total of 275,000 effective men, well armed, drilled, and officered.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page691" id = "page691">691</a></span>
<p><a name = "switzerland_army" id = "switzerland_army">The federal
army</a> is composed of the following arms: engineers, including sappers
and pontoniers; artillery, including rocket batteries; cavalry,
riflemen, light infantry, and infantry. There is besides a medical corps
for the service of the ambulances and hospitals. But as uninstructed men
are of little or no value, the federal law upon military organization
provides that the cantons shall see to it that the infantry of their
contingent is completely instructed according to the federal rules, and
though the application of this principle in its details is left to each
canton, yet the following rules are laid down: recruits are not received
into the federal elite until they have gone through a complete course of
instruction which lasts at least twenty-eight days for infantry, and
thirty-five days for light infantry. The confederation charges itself
with the instruction of the engineers, artillery, cavalry, and riflemen.
This course lasts twenty-eight days for riflemen and forty-two days for
the three other arms, but these recruits have previously been drilled in
the school of the soldier by their cantons, and the riflemen have
received preparatory instruction in firing at a mark.</p>

<p>In the larger cantons&mdash;that of Zurich for
instance&mdash;divisions of recruits in succession are put into barracks
and well drilled practically and theoretically for fifty-six days,
either consecutively or at two periods of the same year, as may best
suit the youths. In the second year after entering the elite, and for
each year afterwards, the infantry is called out for drill during three
days, by half battalions at least, with preparatory drill of three days
for the “cadres,”<a class = "tag" name = "tag9_2" id = "tag9_2" href =
"#note9_2">2</a> the commissioned and non-commissioned officers forming
skeleton corps. Days of entry into service are not counted as days of
drill, and in case of interruption the days of drill are increased by
two days. The reserve is called out for drill during two days of each
year, with a preparatory drill of one day for the “cadres.”</p>

<p>In the corps of engineers, artillery, cavalry, and riflemen, the
elite is called out every alternate year for the engineers and
artillery, and every year for the cavalry and rifles. The drill lasts
four days for the <ins class = "correction"
title = "close quote missing">“cadre”</ins> of engineers and artillery, and immediately after
ten days for the cadres and companies united, or twelve days for both
together. For the cavalry the drill lasts seven days for dragoons and
four days for “guides;” for riflemen, two days for the cadres, and
immediately afterwards four days for cadres and companies united. The
reserve is called out for a drill of half the length of that of the
elite.</p>

<p>To complete the instruction of the soldier the cantons in their turn
send their men yearly to the federal camps where the troops to the
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page692" id = "page692">692</a></span>
number of three or four thousand, are kept under canvas for two weeks.
Larger numbers of men, forming bodies of 5,000 and upwards, are also
mustered and cantoned in the villages, and during several days exercised
in the grand movements and manœuvres of war, chiefly for the instruction
of commanders and officers of the staff.</p>

<p>To keep up the efficiency of every department of the service the
whole is subjected to the yearly inspection of colonels of the federal
staff appointed by the central government. The inspection of infantry is
confided to ten colonels who serve for three years. There is also an
inspector in each of the arms of engineers and artillery, the latter
having under his direction an administrator of materiel charged with the
inspection and surveillance of all the materiel of the confederation.
This administrator directs and superintends the workmen employed in the
factories of the confederation for the manufacture of powder and
percussion caps, as well as arms, gun-carriages, &amp;c. The colonel of
cavalry and the colonel of rifles direct all that relates to their
respective arms, and recommend the necessary improvements. If these
inspectors detect in the contingent of any canton any want of perfection
in drill, they have the power to order such additional drill as may
bring the men up to the proper standard.</p>

<p>Great care is taken in the instruction and selection of officers. The
officers of infantry, up to the grade of major, are appointed by the
cantonal authorities; the higher officers by the federal government. But
no officers can be appointed to the special arms of engineers,
artillery, and cavalry, except such as have gone through a course of
instruction at a military school appropriate to each arm. No one can
become a non-commissioned officer who has not served at least one year
as a soldier, nor a commissioned officer except after two years’
service. Candidates for promotion must pass a public examination, before
a commission, both in theoretical and practical knowledge. Promotion is
given, according to seniority, up to the grade of first lieutenant.
Captains are chosen from among the lieutenants without regard to
seniority. To be appointed major, eight years’ service as an officer is
required, of which, at least, two years as captain. For a
lieutenant-colonel, ten years’ service as officer, of which, at least,
four as major of the special arm. For a colonel, twelve years’ service
as an officer is required, of which, at least, four years as
“commandant,” or in a higher grade. In the Swiss service there is no
higher rank than that of colonel. When a colonel has been appointed
commander-in-chief of the army, he receives for the time being, the
title of general, which he afterwards retains by courtesy.</p>

<p>We are indebted to Professor L. Simonson, of Trinity College,
Hartford, Conn., for the following communication respecting the cadet
system in schools not specially military and the practice of target
shooting in Switzerland, by which a military spirit is fostered
throughout the entire population and the highest skill in the use of the
rifle is attained by a large number of individuals, who are thus
prepared for any sudden call to arms.</p>


<h4><a name = "switzerland_cadet" id = "switzerland_cadet" href =
"#switzerland">2. THE CADET SYSTEM.</a></h4>

<p>The Swiss boy learns target shooting and practices gymnastic and
military exercises at a very early age. He imbibes with his mother’s
milk the thought that his first duty is to become a defender of his
country.</p>

<p><a name = "switzerland_helvetic" id = "switzerland_helvetic">These
boy-soldiers</a> are styled <i>Cadets</i>, and are a fruit that can
spring up and ripen on democratic soil only. The first armed corps of
the kind we find in Berne near the end of the 16th century. But the
general practice of military exercises among them dates back only about
eighty years, when the <span class = "smallcaps">Helvetic Military
Association</span> began to advocate the formation of <i>Corps de
Cadets</i> in all parts of Switzerland. From that time the most
efficient and eminent officers devoted themselves enthusiastically to
this cause. The first corps sprang up in Aarau, Sursen and Olten. Aarau
possessed for a long time the best drilled, largest and finest corps,
and in the canton of Argovia generally the system has struck deeper root
than elsewhere; but well drilled corps can be found in any of the larger
places, as in Zofingen, Lenzburg, Brugg, Baden, and a dozen other
places. It was an old custom for the cadets to parade in the federal
cities&mdash;Zurich, Berne and Lucerne&mdash;in honor of the assembling
of the Swiss Diet, (Tagsatzung.) As far back as 1770 we find a boy-corps
of infantry and artillery in Zurich, yet towards the end of the last
century the organization was partially broken up, until the political
renovation of the canton in 1830 re-organized the corps anew. Besides in
the capital, we find corps in Winterthur, Uster, Wald, Stäfa, Meilen,
Horgen, Wädenswyl, and other towns on the lake shores. Berne, Biel,
Thun, Burgdorf, and many other Bernese villages, for thirty or forty
years have practiced their school-boys in the exercise of arms. The
state takes special care to give the students of the University of Berne
and of the two normal schools a thorough military training. The cantons
of Lucerne, Solothurn, Basle, Schaffhausen, St. Gall, Appenzell, Glarus,
Tessin, Friburg, Neufchâtel, and the countries of Vand and of the
Grisons, possess each of them one or more cadet-corps. Military drill,
as well as gymnastic exercises, forms part of the regular
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page694" id = "page694">694</a></span>
school routine of all middle and higher schools of the above-named
cantons. Provision is now made to extend this discipline over all
schools, making it obligatory on every pupil who is not disabled by
bodily defects. Military practice commences at the age of eleven and is
continued to the age of eighteen or nineteen. Federal or cantonal
officers and instructors drill the youth two afternoons in the week, the
more advanced only once a week. The youth thus disciplined, learn not
only to obey but also to command. The officers of every corps are
promoted from the rank and file, and in this manner are excellently
fitted to become afterwards officers in the federal army. All cadets
when they are enrolled at a later period into the militia, are by law
exempted from drill. The arms are furnished by the state or community;
the uniform, which the pupil may wear in or out of service, must be
procured by himself.</p>

<p>Most of the cadet-corps consist of infantry, (sharp-shooters and
musketeers;) many have, however, artillery also, as in Zurich, their
guns throwing balls of two and four pounds weight. In Argovia and some
other cantons there are even grenadiers and sappers. Cavalry exist in
theory only. A&nbsp;gun with bayonet and cartridge-box, here and there
also a knapsack and sword form the equipment of the foot-soldier. The
uniforms are various and fanciful. The Zurich Cadets distinguish
themselves by their simple and tasteful appearance; they wear a dark
blue coat with white metal buttons, grey pants, and dark blue cap with
the cockade. Every corps has one or more smaller or larger flags. Many
cantons have excellent bands of music; others, as Zurich, have only
drummers and their indispensable drum-major, and sing martial songs
while marching.</p>

<p><a name = "switzerland_festival" id = "switzerland_festival">It is a
universal custom</a> to close the school year in autumn by a festival,
the shining point of which is the military parade and field manœuvre.
The Swiss juvenile festivals have gained quite a reputation at home and
abroad. In the Argovian communities all the school children, the females
as well as males, festively adorned, participate. The corps of the whole
canton and even of several cantons are often united in the field
manœuvre; on such an occasion the enthusiasm and emulation of youth
reach the highest pitch. Thus the Bernese Cadet Corps in 1821 had a
common drill parade in the neighborhood of the capital, and many others
have since come off. In 1816 about 1,000 Argovians went into camp at
Lenzburg, and all of them will joyfully remember this merry festival.
A&nbsp;still greater notoriety was gained by the hot sham fights at
Wettingen, which came off in 1821, and in which the Argovian, Zurich and
Winterthur cadets operated together.
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page695" id = "page695">695</a></span>
Two brigades consisting of 1,560 men, all told, with seven cannon fought
there for the positions between Wettingen and Baden; the most glorious
affair of the day was the heroic defense and final storming of the
Wettingen bridge. <a name = "switzerland_1856" id =
"switzerland_1856">Yet all other manœuvres</a> of that sort have been
thrown into shadow by the great Swiss cadet feast in September, 1856. It
will not be forgotten by the thousands, who participated either as
actors or spectators, even if there should be at some future day a
re-union of all the corps of Switzerland. Ten cantons participated in
that festival. Argovia furnished 974 men; Zurich, 805; St. Gall, 472;
Schaffhausen, 186; the Grisons, 166; Ausserrhoden, 155; Lucerne, 148;
Thurgovia, 111; Glarus, 60; and Tessin even sent over the St. Gothard a
contingent of eighty-four. Thus 3,161 young heroes, in various but
generally tasteful uniforms, with bands of music, one hundred and
twenty-four drums, numerous banners, and ten cannon, entered the
festively-adorned Zurich from all sides. Divided into two little armies
drawn up in battle array between Oerlicon and Schwamendingen, they
fought over the celebrated battle of June 4th, 1799, in which the French
under Massena, were defeated by the Austrians under Archduke
Charles.</p>

<p>The youths in Zurich as well as in other cantons, have no reason to
complain that their physical development is neglected in favor of the
mental; nay, we might rather fear that the first is at times too much
exaggerated, considering the tender age of the majority of the boys. The
pupils of the canton Gymnasium and Industrial School, many of whom are
foreigners, Germans especially, practice gymnastic exercises throughout
the whole year; the military drill is limited to the summer course only.
In the month of August, from time immemorial, the boys, all and every
one, practice target-shooting. The smaller boys only are allowed to rest
the gun on the stand; the older must shoot without any support whatever.
The cities and individuals furnish prizes for those who hit the centre
of the target. In September the cadets&mdash;the infantry as well as
artillery&mdash;hold their target-shooting; in October they drill in the
field, (“Vorkämpfli,”) and then comes off the annual School Festival
with its gymnastic exercises and the combined manœuvre in field.</p>

<p><a name = "switzerland_1860" id = "switzerland_1860">At the sham
fight</a> on the 1st of October, 1860, the enemy as usual existed in
fancy only; they fired, however, as if he were flesh and blood. They had
the task of pursuing the imaginary foe from Windicon to the Höckler. The
division marched over the covered bridge at Aussersihl, detached then a
column to the woody heights in order to outflank the enemy, while the
principal body marched along the
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page696" id = "page696">696</a></span>
Sihl and drove the enemy from the clearings into the thick woods. Both
divisions re-united at the Höckler Bridge and marched to the great
“Wollishofer Allmend,” where they practiced firing. This is a beautiful
spot for the deployment of troops; the sound of every shot is returned
in manifold echoes from the surrounding heights. The Zurich and federal
troops also encamp, practice, and shoot on this “Allmend.”</p>

<p>The annual festival of one canton school came off on the day for
gymnastic and military exercises. The printed programme distributed
among the pupils contains the order of exercises, the plan of the
manœuvre, and some useful hints in large type, as, “Clear the
road”&mdash;“Smoking is prohibited to the pupils during the
festival”&mdash;“Not too fast”&mdash;“Do not forget the
ramrod”&mdash;“Always 120 paces distance.” At 6 o’clock, A.M., the
drummers beat the reveille, proceeding from the guard-house in three
different directions. If the weather is unfavorable, the reveille is not
beaten, the school begins at the usual hour, and the next fair day is
chosen for the feast. The beaming sun dispersed, however, on this
occasion, the autumnal morning mists, and universal joy beamed from all
faces. On the first day the public gymnastic exercises came off, and
after supper the decisions of the umpires were proclaimed and prizes
distributed.</p>

<p>The second day the whole corps, numbering about five hundred, hastens
at 7 o’clock, armed and equipped, to the barracks, and marches from
there to the open space near the railroad station, where from 8 to 10,
Colonel Ziegler, the Secretary of War, accompanied by members of the
Board of Supervisors, is occupied with the general inspection of “his
young comrades.” At 12½ the corps assembles again near the barracks,
where they receive their ammunition, and at 1 o’clock they turn out to
the manœuvre. The corps is divided into two small armies, each of which
consists of a centre, right and left wings, and a reserve. The enemy
under the command of Lieutenant-colonel Von Escher, marches over
Riesbach and Zollicon into his position. The federal troops under
Commandant Nadler, take their way over Hirslanden and the Balgrist. The
left wing of the enemy, meanwhile, had taken possession of the heights
above the Zollicon, and his main body is marching on the right bank of
the lake upon Zurich. The enemy makes a halt, and receives the report of
his scouts, that the “Burghölzli” and the heights of the Balgrist have
been taken possession of by the federal army for the purpose of impeding
the further advance of the hostile troops over Hirslanden. The federals
at 3 o’clock attack the enemy in his position on the mountain, but they
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page697" id = "page697">697</a></span>
are beaten back, notwithstanding their heroic endeavors, and are
compelled to retreat since the enemy changes his defensive position into
a general charge. The federals retire in good order, and the enemy
purchases every inch of ground at a great sacrifice. Though he succeeds
in cutting off a side column, his losses must be great until he can
silence the murderous fire of the federal battery which has taken a very
favorable position on the “Oberrieder Heights,” and after having done so
he advances to the lowlands.</p>

<p>The fight offers many a picturesque scene. Nowhere such a
diversified, broken battle-ground can be found as in the Swiss
fore-lands. Especially in the neighborhood of Zurich one is at a loss
which to choose. There are every where covers and ambuscades for
riflemen; the infantry find numerous advantageous positions, and many
heights easily accessible which command vales and plains are at the
command of the artillery. The leaders have hard work to restrain the
ardor of the boy-soldiers, especially of those in the broken chain of
the sharp-shooters. Finally the signal shot is fired, followed
immediately by many others. It is a real feast to observe how the
skirmishers, while running from one cover to the other, crouch together
as much as possible; how skillfully they take advantage of every little
mound, and how they endeavor in their attack to avail themselves of
every protection. This or that one seems a perfect little Zouave; some
even show the disposition of a Turcos. One loads his rifle lying flat on
his back, another springs forward like a tiger. To be commanded to the
chain of the skirmishers is considered special good fortune, for there
the individual is something by himself, can move at will, and is
supplied with plenty of ammunition. Yet, the main body also of the army,
which is obliged to fight in closed lines and strict order, is allowed
to vent its fury in firing by single files and by battalions in
thundering vollies. At the command to fire a hundred muskets at once,
but a single peal as of thunder is heard, and the smoke of the powder
fills the air with the sweetest of savors. For a change we turn to the
artillery. Though they do not possess any rifled cannon, they are
nevertheless intent upon aiming their guns accurately, and the little
self-possessed gunners who serve the pieces would prove dangerous
adversaries to any foe. They mount and dismount a piece as quickly as
any trained artillery-man, and where the ground offers great
impediments, one can see the stronger boys carrying their own
pieces.</p>

<p>The “Father of the Cadets,” Colonel Ziegler, is present at the sham
fights as an impartial umpire, walking continually on the battle-field,
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page698" id = "page698">698</a></span>
and smiling as one or the other section makes a good hit. As soon as the
retreating federal troops have gained a favorable position, they stop
short, concentrate their forces, and brave any further advance of the
enemy who, after he has made some further unsuccessful attempts, is
convinced that the federals are a match for him, and even stronger than
himself, makes a halt, and the battle ends. The white cross in the red
field (the federal banner) remains, of course always master of the
field.</p>

<p>Many a manœuvre has ended without any accident, yet sometimes a
hot-blooded cadet forgets the ramrod, and wounds a soldier from the
hostile lines or a spectator, for the people mingle without fear among
the combatants. Every Swiss is a soldier, and the crack of the guns is a
congenial sound to him. The European diplomatists who met in Zurich in
the Fall of 1860 for the settlement of the peace of Villafranca, were
all present at the manœuvres, and undoubtedly depicted the cadet system
to their respective governments in glowing colors, recommending the
general adoption of the system. We now ask our governors and our people
in general&mdash;“Shall we be the last?” A&nbsp;noble ardor may
accomplish a good deal, yet <i>strength</i> combined with will can
accomplish far more&mdash;almost every thing.</p>

<p>After the parties have fought an hour and a half in the sight of the
Alps and the glittering lake, and rested a little while, they march in
brotherly union with glowing faces, to the sound of the drum, or singing
patriotic songs, from the heights down to the shore road, enter
Tiefbrunnen, and stack their arms in pyramids on the green sward of its
hospitable pleasure-grounds. Then after the labor and heat of the day,
the young soldiers hasten at double-quick step, and with Goliath-like
appetite, to the garden of the neighboring inn, which stands on the
shore of the beautiful lake, and give fearful battle to a second enemy
in the form of loaves, sausages, etc.; the blood of the grape runs like
water, and so indefatigable are they in continually repeated onslaughts,
that in a short time the forces of the enemy have wholly disappeared.
The state bears the expenses, in order that the poorest boy may be that
day as rich as his upper-ten comrade. Shouts and hurras spice the good
things still more. Meanwhile it has grown dark, the cadets take to their
arms again, and by the light of numerous torches, Colonel Ziegler
proclaims and distributes the prizes. The name of every victor is
received with the beat of the drum and thousands of hurras. The results
of the target shooting in 1860 were not so satisfactory as in former
years. The artillery gained 65 prizes in one hundred shots, the foot 28;
while in 1859 the former received 86,
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page699" id = "page699">699</a></span>
and the latter 33, in the average of all distances. The first two prizes
were again taken by Glarus boys. This little people, renowned through
its marksmen, has for the last seven years monopolized the first
prizes.</p>

<p>Finally the warlike band marches home and the officers and
instructors meet again at a social supper, which lasts until after
midnight. Thus ends the manœuvre of Swiss boys.</p>

<p>The Swiss militia system may be our model. It will insure our
internal peace and national independence. It will unite the citizens of
all states into one band of brothers. Every people rears troublesome
individuals. Switzerland had to contend with internal difficulties,
factions, etc., as we have now, but the majesty of the law was upheld by
the masses, and while the rebels were beaten in the field, the people of
the different sections met again in friendship. And so, we trust, it
will be with us. The day may not be distant when we shall want the
strength of our whole beloved Union to maintain our position among the
great nations of the earth. United we need not fear the world in
arms.</p>

<p>The Swiss are the most peaceable and industrious people, and at the
same time the most warlike and ever-ready. In the idea of the Swiss, the
citizen is inseparable from the soldier, lest the free man should become
the slave of a domestic or foreign tyrant. The first advantage of this
idea is, that Switzerland has not a standing army, and yet it can call
into the field at any moment 200,000 well trained men in the flower of
their age; a like number could be raised of younger men under twenty-one
and above forty-five. 200,000 men is eight per cent of its population,
according to which we could have about 2,200,000 citizen soldiers, not
on paper only, but real soldiers. If we institute the cadet system the
next generation will be a warlike one, and no American will even think
of making a law, exempting the citizen from his first duty to appear in
person for the defense of his liberties and independence. The whole
amount of the Swiss military <i>Budget</i><a class = "tag" name =
"tag9_3" id = "tag9_3" href = "#note9_3">3</a> is between four and five
millions of francs, equal to ten millions of dollars for our 2,200,000
men&mdash;a trifle indeed.</p>

<p>From time to time the governors of neighboring states could unite the
cadet-corps of different sections and invite the corps from distant
states to send a contingent for a grand manœuvre. Such a proceeding
would tend more to cement the band of brotherhood among the states than
many artificial means. It would at the same time promote the good morals
of the boys, if the governors were to select the
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page700" id = "page700">700</a></span>
best delegates from their states. Every obdurate, mischievous individual
should be expelled from the ranks, since the state must not suffer a bad
subject to enjoy the honor of serving his country. What a wonderful
change will take place in the disposition of our youth; when accustomed
to the discipline of a soldier, many a bad habit will disappear
entirely. They will become punctual and orderly in the execution of
their duties in general, their step elastic, their carriage erect, their
bodies strong, their chests large, their cheeks rosy, a joy to their
parents and a pride to our people. The lad who leaves his city or his
state, if furnished with a regular certificate from his drill-master,
can enter a company in the place of his future residence, and be no
longer a stranger but a brother-soldier&mdash;the member of a mighty
association. He enters the circle of well educated boys at once, and is
thus saved from the danger of associating with such as might corrupt his
good habits. There are thousands of advantages to him and the country,
and not a single disadvantage. Why shall we not seize upon the subject
at once? Let our small state have the honor to be the first, as we
already have the best regulated system of schools&mdash;primary,
secondary, and higher institutions. Forward! forward!</p>

<p>In a subsequent article we shall give a description of a “Swiss
Shooting Festival.” It is an ancient custom with the Alpine people, but
since the system of cadet corps has become perfected, these festivals
have come off with a splendor that had never before been dreamed of.
They unite the men of all sections and have gained quite a fame in
Europe.</p>

<p>We implore all statesmen and teachers to take the system of <ins
class = "correction"
title = "text has ‘mili-/itary’ at line break">military</ins> drill and organization in schools into due
consideration; not as a mere experiment, but as something that has
proved an excellent success in a sister republic.</p>


<h4><a name = "switzerland_target" id = "switzerland_target" href =
"#switzerland">3. TARGET SHOOTING.</a></h4>

<p>Having made military exercises a part of the regular routine of
schools and the education of youths, and identified the vocation of the
soldier with the privileges of citizenship and the safety of the state,
the policy of the Swiss government, both cantonal and federal, has been
directed so as to make the pastimes of neighborhoods and the national
festivals minister to the general culture of a military spirit, and of
the highest individual skill in the use of arms. To these ends target
shooting is encouraged in various ways, and the festivals of the
sharp-shooters are more generally and enthusiastically attended than any
other national anniversary. We give below an account of a festival of
this kind, which was held in Zurich in July, 1859.</p>


<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page701" id = "page701">701</a></span>
<p class = "heading"><i>A Festival of the Swiss Sharp-shooters.</i></p>

<p>The Frenchman has his rose festivals; the Italian his barcaroli; the
Spaniard his bull-fights; the Englishman, since his cock-fights and
boxing in the street are prohibited, has nothing left to him, for
horse-racing as well as the Parliament belongs to the aristocracy
only.<a class = "tag" name = "tag9_4" id = "tag9_4" href =
"#note9_4">4</a> Germany has its popular festivals, though the
potentates have suppressed even these harmless popular gatherings in
several parts of the country.</p>

<p>In southern Germany and in the north-west you may still find the
old-fashioned popular festivals. But Switzerland is their field; there
in the land of freedom they flourish in the utmost freshness. They
arouse and foster in the people the consciousness that they are a
people&mdash;a nation; they awaken and strengthen the national spirit;
they unite all citizens, whether they sit as legislators in the Diet, or
till the ground in some unknown corner of the republic.</p>

<p>The festival begins at 6 o’clock, A.M., with the firing of
cannon&mdash;one shot for each of the twenty-two cantons into which
Switzerland is divided. The sharp-shooter festivals are the oldest of
the Swiss popular festivals&mdash;the original fruits of a free warlike
people. They are customary in every canton, in every community. But the
<i>Swiss</i> sharp-shooter festival means that in which the whole
country unites, and it has existed now for many, many years, always
fresher and more beautiful, representing not only the united citizens of
the Swiss cantons, but of Switzerland as a political power.</p>

<p>Such a festival takes place every second year. Then, thirty thousand
free, warlike men, the best marksmen from all parts of the land, the
“élite” of Switzerland’s defenders, assemble with their rifles, which
they handle with more skill than any other nation. They represent in
fact the best men of their nation, the bodyguard of law and order, the
rampart against hostile aggressions, and the stay of popular commotions.
In such a noble assembly many a wise word is spoken, many an idea
exchanged and corrected. The actions of the administration are subjected
to a sharp but judicious and just criticism; you will not hear there
ostentatious speeches, nor see noisy demonstrations. They do not pass
resolutions such as we are wont to see in our country&mdash;a small
clique of petty politicians announcing to the people that: <i>The People
of the State, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. resolved, etc.</i>; but calmly they
reason and reflect on what would be beneficial to all sections of the
country, and after having reconciled the opposing interests of all,
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page702" id = "page702">702</a></span>
they go home and work each in his circle for the realization of their
ideas. There is a principle&mdash;not of blind opposition to actions,
whether good or bad, simply because they proceed from another
party&mdash;but the principle of doing justice to all, of upholding the
rights of all, and of reconciling opposing interests. A&nbsp;people that
has been educated in such principles and acts in accordance with them
has reached the perfection of republicanism, and need not fear either
internal or external foes. Every American patriot may take example from
this little Alpine race; and since every one, man or woman, is by nature
an educator, whether as director of a household, or as a teacher of
other men’s children, let us all unite in educating the growing
generation in the right way, and our beloved country shall never again
see brothers in arms against brothers.</p>

<p>Many a corrupt official has feared the criticism of the assembly of
the Swiss sharp-shooters, and whatever “the men have resolved at the
festival,” is usually adopted by the people and carried through in a
judicious, constitutional way.</p>

<p>At the above-mentioned day Zurich was all in a glee; the city adorned
with flags, triumphal arches and evergreens, the streets thronging with
people in Sunday dress who had come from far and wide to participate in
the popular feast. The shrill sound of an engine is heard, and soon
after the first company of guests from abroad forms in line at the
railroad station. It is the delegation from the Bremen sharp-shooters,
who have come from the far north of Germany to meet their brethren of
the south. They are enthusiastically received by the crowd, the mayor
addresses them and gives them a cordial welcome to the land of freedom.
After one of their number has replied to the speech, the mayor leads the
guests to a tent and invites them to partake of some refreshments; the
best of native wines from the “Rathskeller” are offered, and many a
toast spices the nectar.</p>

<p>An hour later the flag of the Swiss sharp-shooters is received and
unfolded, while shouts and the roar of cannon rend the air. As we stated
before, the festival of the United Sharp-shooters comes off once in two
years, city and canton taking their turns. Two years before, in July,
1857, it had been celebrated in Berne, and the flag had remained there
until now, when a deputation from Berne delivers it to the
sharp-shooters of Zurich, to be kept by them for the next two years; and
so on.</p>

<p>As soon as the banner is unfurled the procession is formed, and the
banner and guests are escorted to the City Hall, preceded by bands of
music playing national airs. What a glorious sight! Man and nature
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page703" id = "page703">703</a></span>
seem to revel together in joy. The bright morning sunshine gleams from
the polished rifles and a thousand flags wave in the light breeze, while
the procession is accompanied by crowds of men and women, boys and
rosy-cheeked girls who, dressed in white and decked with red ribbons, in
the national costume and colors, add an element of bewitching beauty to
the scene.</p>

<p>Meanwhile other companies of riflemen have arrived, and the lake is
still covered with festively-adorned gondolas that are continually
adding to the crowd of guests. At 10 o’clock the procession is again
formed. It leaves the city and moves toward the “Seefeld,” a large
meadow on the shore of the lake, a short distance from the city. Here an
immense hall has been erected. Behind it are arranged the targets and
shooting-stands, and opposite we see a neat structure in the form of a
temple, with many large windows, in which are exhibited the prizes,
disposed in the most attractive manner. These prizes are of the value of
104,407 francs, and are the contributions of all parts of the
world&mdash;every corner where a few Swiss are to be found, having
furnished some small gift in honor of the national festival.</p>

<p>The procession halts in front of the temple. The Bernese deliver into
the hands of the Zurich delegation the flag of the Swiss Rifle Corps,
and Colonel Kurtz, of Berne, thus briefly addresses them: “When two
years ago this flag was delivered into our safe keeping, peace reigned
all around us; and but just now our country has come forth victoriously
from a crisis in which we have shown, as, we had never done before, that
we are <i>one</i> band of brethren.<a class = "tag" name = "tag9_5" id =
"tag9_5" href = "#note9_5">5</a> What we have hoped for is now realized,
and we can carry this flag&mdash;the banner of the largest association
in Switzerland&mdash;to the beautiful lake whose blue waters play around
our sister town. We of Berne have held this flag in peace. Who knows
whether you will be as fortunate, or whether you will be forced to plant
it on the highest pinnacle of your good city, as a sign that the
fatherland is in danger and calls upon her sons to defend her.
Relentless war rages now on our borders;<a class = "tag" name = "tag9_6"
id = "tag9_6" href = "#note9_6">6</a> we know not whether the storm will
pass over, or the thunderbolt strike in our midst.”</p>

<p>Dr. Dubs replies in a brilliant speech: “We receive this banner and
shall defend it. We are ready now for a joyous feast, and as ready at
any time for the war-dance. Let the trumpet sound and
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page704" id = "page704">704</a></span>
Zurich’s men will be the first in the field to lead you on to victory or
death!” etc.</p>

<p>Thus was the festival opened. A dinner had been prepared in the hall,
to which all marksmen, whether from home or abroad, were invited. This
hall is a wooden structure of large dimensions, open at the sides, with
a wide passage running through the middle, intersected by several narrow
ones. In the middle of the building is a magnificent fountain. The whole
remaining space is filled with tables and benches of unvarnished pine,
at which 6,000 persons may be conveniently seated and served,
A&nbsp;platform hung with Swiss banners is so placed that the speakers
can be heard through the whole hall, and many a wise word has been
thence spoken that met a ready response from both present and distant
brethren. Behind this platform is raised a lofty gallery for the music.
Here the bands play soul-stirring chorals and national tunes, and when
the “Marseillaise,” or other similar air is heard, a chorus of thousands
of voices accompanies enthusiastically the instruments. It is in fact a
feast of the people; unity, peace and joy reign everywhere. There may be
seen men of different religious and political creeds, embracing each
other in brotherly concord. Men whose language is Italian from the
southern cantons, and men who speak French from the west, and German
from the northern, eastern, and middle cantons, form <i>one</i> family,
though their localities, institutions, and interests may differ widely.
The words which Schiller, in his well-known historical drama, “Tell,”
causes Rösselmann to express&mdash;</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>“By this fair light, which greeteth us before</p>
<p>&nbsp; Those other nations that, beneath us far,</p>
<p>&nbsp; In noisome cities pent, draw painful breath,</p>
<p>&nbsp; Swear we the oath of our confederacy!</p>
<p>&nbsp; We swear to be a nation of <i>true brothers</i>,</p>
<p>&nbsp; Never to part, in danger or in death!</p>
</div>

<p class = "continue">These words have become true in our age.</p>

<p>At 1 o’clock the firing of a cannon announces the commencement of the
target shooting. The marksmen press to the stands, and their shooting
continues from morning till evening, with only an intermission of an
hour for dinner, for an entire week. As we have before said, the
shooting-stands are erected at the end of the hall, but in a separate
building. Ninety-six stands are arranged in one line, each with its own
target, so that nearly a hundred shots may be fired at once. Behind each
stand there is sufficient space for loading the rifles, and all the
necessary apparatus. There are smaller buildings near by for the
repairing of arms, and a regular field-hospital, completely furnished,
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page705" id = "page705">705</a></span>
to supply medical or surgical aid to such as may fall suddenly sick or
be wounded. The medical fraternity of Zurich have offered their services
in turn, and two physicians of their number are always present day and
night. The shooting is directed towards the lake and large quantities of
firewood are piled up like a rampart around the grounds, so that an
accident is almost impossible. Navigation on the lake within a certain
distance is also prohibited. The safety of the people is thus secured,
and an accident can happen only at the stands or to a careless
target-man. Only two injuries in all have been reported&mdash;a
finger-wound received by a marksman, and the loss of an eye to a
target-man by a splinter from the target.</p>

<p>More than thirty thousand tried their skill during the ten days of
the festival. On the 7th of July 74,000 shots were fired, and about
61,000 on the 11th, though many of the people had already gone home. The
rifles and targets are of various kinds. The Swiss have rifles for field
service, and also target rifles&mdash;the latter being much the heavier.
No support whatever is used with either. The distance of the target is
proportioned to the calibre of the rifles, the “field targets” being
over a thousand, and the “stand targets” about six hundred feet distant.
Both the stand and field targets are sub-divided into “Stich” and
“Kehrscheiben;” the former a single fixed target, the latter made double
and turned around after each shot, so as to be immediately ready for
another marksman. The “Kehrscheiben” are designated by the letters in
the order of the alphabet; the “Stichscheiben” have names attached to
each, such as “the Stand,” “Fatherland,” “Industry,” “Titlis,”
“Pilatus,” “Rigi,” “Gotthard,” <ins class = "correction"
title = "open quote missing">“Jungfrau,”</ins> “Splügen,” “the Field,” &amp;c. No more
than one shot may be fired by the same marksman at any of the
“Stichscheiben,” with the exception of the “Fatherland,” at which two
are allowed. The number of shots at the “Kehrscheiben” is not limited,
but all must be paid for&mdash;the “Kehrscheiben” at the rate of about
thirty centimes, (six cents;) the “Stichscheiben” a little more.
Commutation tickets, however, may be obtained.</p>

<p>The prizes are very various, but the most valuable are appropriated
to the “Stichscheiben.” The first prize this year was a large silver
basin, of exquisite workmanship, together with 2,500 francs ($500) in
money, given by the Swiss in Paris, to be won at the target
“Fatherland.” The lowest prize is five francs, and this can be won only
by those who succeed in hitting the bull’s eye, the size of which varies
in the different targets. In the “Stichscheiben” for the target rifle it
measures ten inches in diameter, but in the “Kehrscheiben”
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page706" id = "page706">706</a></span>
only two and a half, while in the “Kehrscheiben” for the field rifle it
measures six inches. Every six hits in the centre of the “Kehrscheiben”
gains a prize of five francs, to which is added on the twenty-fifth
successful shot, a silver cup or watch. He who hits the bull’s eye fifty
times receives another prize of one hundred francs. Special prizes are
also given to the best marksman <i>of the day</i>, for the first and
last hits <i>of the day</i>, and for the greatest number of hits during
<i>the whole festival</i>, etc. The prizes of the day may be obtained
immediately; the others are distributed publicly at the close of the
festival.</p>

<p>Let us now give a glance at the “Gift Temple.” This neat structure is
made wholly of glass, save the roof, in order that the rich prizes may
be more conspicuously exhibited. Here are gifts and prizes for the
successful shooters, consisting either in articles of value or in money,
that have been contributed by the cantonal governments and communities,
and by individuals at home or abroad. The government has also had new
Swiss five-franc pieces coined for this purpose, bearing on their face
the figure of a rifleman instead of Helvetia. There is many a piece of
fine workmanship among the gifts, of which we can here only mention the
silver basin with the 2,500 francs, the first prize of the “Fatherland,”
and a beautiful drinking horn of massive silver, richly embossed,
presented by some friends in Leipsic. The Bremen sharp-shooters also
brought with them twelve “Römer,” large cups of massive silver, gilt
within, which were admired and coveted by all the disciples of Bacchus.
This was not, however, the only present from the old Hanse-town. The
senate had opened the celebrated “Rathskeller” and sent some of their
Hock of the vintage of 1684, the Nestor of German wines, to their
brothers in Bacchus. The greater part of these gifts consisted in silver
cups, and pitchers, and gold and silver watches.</p>

<p>During the festival the houses of Zurich continued adorned with
flags, transparencies, and evergreens, which were every day entwined
with fresh flowers. Near the festive hall a triumphal arch had been
erected, on which stood a colossal figure of William Tell in the act of
menacing Gesler with the arrow, after having shot the apple from the
head of his boy. Some of the critics would have us believe that Tell is
not Tell, that no such person ever existed, but that he is a purely
mythical character&mdash;the creation of Schiller’s imagination. Yet it
matters little to the Swiss whether the hero was, or was not; all these
thousands of marksmen who daily pass that triumphal arch are possessed
by one thought, and many can not refrain from shouting, “Hurrah for
Tell, father of the marksman! The Swiss of to-day is as
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page707" id = "page707">707</a></span>
skillful an archer, as daring and as free as thou wast!” Myth or not,
Tell is the man of the people, the Washington of Switzerland&mdash;or,
rather, Washington is the Tell of America; and these words of the dying
Attinghausen&mdash;</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>“Hold fast together, then&mdash;for ever fast.</p>
<p>&nbsp; Let freedom’s haunts be one in heart, in mind!</p>
<p>&nbsp; Set watches on your mountain tops, that league</p>
<p>&nbsp; May answer league, when comes the hour to strike.</p>
<p>&nbsp; Be <i>one</i>&mdash;be <i>one</i>&mdash;be
<i>one</i>”&mdash;</p>
</div>

<p class = "continue">are never forgotten in these days by the
inhabitants of Switzerland.</p>

<p>Around the hall there has sprung up a village of wood and canvas, and
while the men are engaged with their rifles, the women and children
crowd to see the circus, the menageries, rope-dancers, puppet-shows,
“the giant Kentuckian,” “General Tom Thumb,” &amp;c., and while every
one amuses himself, there is no rioting, no impropriety, no beggary, no
placards bidding us to “Beware of Pickpockets;” the people are as sound
as their institutions.</p>

<p>At 8 o’clock in the morning the target shooting commences, closing at
8 in the evening. The target and signal men are promptly at their
stations, and the members of the different committees for keeping order,
arrive one by one. The marksmen are impatiently awaiting the signal
shot. Spectators gather in from all sides. The signal is given, and in a
moment the sharp crack of ninety-six rifles is heard. The firing is kept
up incessantly till noon, when the sound of the cannon again calls to
dinner. At about 10 o’clock the first steamers have landed their
passengers from “beyond the water,” and the first trains have come in,
bringing new guests to supply the place of those who leave, so that new
faces and new acquaintances greet us every day. Here a fresh company of
sharp-shooters from distant Ticino approaches, marching to the sound of
music and preceded by their flag, and receive their welcome&mdash;there
another company from Neufchâtel is escorted to the station and takes its
departure homeward.</p>

<p>One of the most joyous occurrences of the festival&mdash;a silvery
gleam in the general sunshine&mdash;was the reception of the marksmen
from the four forest towns, Lucerne, Switz, Uri, and Unterwalden. They
numbered full seven hundred men, noble specimens of the native Swiss,
all picked men&mdash;“Kernmannen.” They were preceded by four of their
number attired in the ancient national costume, who carried the very
same bugles that for the last five centuries had called their
forefathers to arms. The ancient banners followed. As they passed under
the triumphal arch and beheld their father, Tell, their shouts, hurrahs,
and vivas, knew no bounds. Their ranks were broken and
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page708" id = "page708">708</a></span>
each threw himself upon the breast of the nearest stranger&mdash;nay,
brother. The very men that perhaps were adversaries in public life, or
opposed to each other in political principles, were here united; the
love of fatherland was a common bond of union. Thus, also, Schiller
speaks through the mouth of Meier:</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>“I know him well. There is a suit between us,</p>
<p>&nbsp; About a piece of ancient heritage;</p>
<p>&nbsp; Herr Reding, <i>we are enemies in court;</i></p>
<p>&nbsp; <i>Here we are one</i>.”</p>
</div>

<p>Thus is it in Switzerland. Will it ever be so with us? Come, ye
educators of the people and of the young, preach this principle from the
pulpit, and make it the corner stone of your instructions in the school
and at the firesides of your homes!</p>

<p>At the signal for the noon intermission the firing immediately
ceases, and in a few minutes 6,000 hungry and thirsty people are seated
at the one hundred and fifty tables in the hall; the rest disperse to
the eating-houses in the neighborhood and in the city. The dinner is
enlivened by toasts which, however, are never of a personal character.
No homage is done to the individual; to the country, to the fatherland
alone, is homage due in a republic. Toasts are heard in German, in
French, in Italian&mdash;yet all tongues unite in the glorification of a
common country. Separate tables are set for the different cantons, but
so arranged that the more distant cantons are usually the nearest
together&mdash;Ticino near Berne, Geneva near Basle, Zurich near Vaud.
In the middle of the hall are the tables for the committees and the
honorary guests.</p>

<p>On the second day of the festival the delegations of marksmen hold a
general conference, and though they enter the hall with opposing
opinions and feelings, yet before they part all differences are settled,
all contradictions are reconciled, and their resolutions are usually
endorsed by the whole people. There is no tendency to disunion, no
necessity for secession, for each one endeavors to satisfy the wishes of
the other; the public weal is considered, not the interest or
aggrandizement of the individual or of the canton.</p>

<p>On Sunday, the 10th of July, a public service was held on the meadow.
It was a solemn ceremony, attended by all the different creeds that hold
fellowship together. On the next day the members of the Diet, which was
then in session at Berne, visited Zurich. The banished duchess of Parma,
who lives in the neighboring Swiss town, Pappenschwyl, was also the
guest of the citizens. She and her children sat with them at the rough
pine board and partook of the same
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page709" id = "page709">709</a></span>
viands. After the dinner she said, with tears in her eyes, “The Swiss do
not know how happy they indeed are.”</p>

<p>On Tuesday, July 12th, the last shot was fired, and on the following
day the prizes were distributed. This ceremony took place on the grounds
before the gift temple. President Dubs opened with a speech, in which he
said: “We are distributing now the prizes to those who have proved
themselves the best marksmen. An equal chance is given to all; let all
practice with their weapons and emulate their lucky companions.
I&nbsp;am convinced that all who have hit the centre of the target will
be able to pierce the breast of the enemy, should war be unavoidable.”
The first prize, the silver basin from Paris, with the 2,500 francs, was
won by a manufacturer, Durrer, of Unterwalden; the second, the silver
horn from Leipzig, by a farmer named Glogg, of Obermeilen; the third,
the twelve silver cups from Bremen, jointly by Professor Dr. Hug, of the
University of Zurich, and Mr. Baer, of Männedorf, the best shot in
Switzerland, who had hit the target four hundred and eighty-seven times
during the festival.</p>

<p>The whole was closed with a serenade, given by the marksmen to
President Dubs, the chief magistrate of the confederacy, as well as
president of the festival. The next day the remaining guests departed,
the garlands and banners disappeared, the people returned to their
business, all external show had vanished; but the feeling that
Switzerland’s sons have again renewed the bonds of their brotherhood
still survives in the breasts of that simple, quiet people&mdash;our
republican brethren of the Alps.</p>

<h4><a name = "switzerland_officers" id = "switzerland_officers" href =
"#switzerland">SCHOOLS OF INSTRUCTION FOR OFFICERS.</a></h4>

<p>The Federal system of Military Instruction for officers, in 1871,
embraced&mdash;</p>

<p>I. A Central Military School at Thun, to which all officers appointed
to the General Staff repair to be instructed in their duties.</p>

<p>II. A School of Officers at Thun, in which all officers appointed to
their respective regiments are instructed in their duties.</p>

<p>III. A School of Cantonal Instruction, held in Basle, to which the
infantry instructors resort from every canton to learn their duties,
undergo inspection, and preserve a common rule.</p>

<p>IV. A School of Young Officers, held at Solothurn and at St. Gallen,
turn by turn, to which the several Cantons send their young officers who
have just received their commissions, and to which all candidates for
commissions repair for examinations.</p>

<p>V. Comissariat School, to which is joined a Medical and Ambulance
School generally, at Thun.</p>

<p>VI. A Shooting School, for officers who give instruction to the Cadet
Corps and other organizations in the several Cantons.</p>

<p>To these school organizations with their practical exercises must be
added the opportunities afforded by the Cantonal reviews and field
manœuvres, to which the young Swiss officer brings much valuable
experience in his previous school and cadet drill.</p>

<p>The events of the late French-Prussian war tested the efficiency of
the Swiss military organization and instruction. The French declaration
was announced in Paris in the afternoon of Friday, July 15, 1870, and
responded to by a counter declaration from Berlin on Tuesday, the 19th.
But the Federal Council of Switzerland (which lay between the
combatants, and might become the first theatre of belligerent
operations), was summoned by President Dubs to consider the situation;
and within an hour, the Cantons had been regularly summoned to complete
their regiments with men, arms, horses, guns, and all stores and tools
required for actual service, and five divisions of the Elite (the first,
second, sixth, seventh, and ninth), were ordered to assemble in their
several Cantons. The first division, under Colonel Egtoff, was to secure
the bridge at Basle and occupy the two banks of the Rhine. The first
news which the men of Aargau had of the impending war was late on Friday
night. By noon on Saturday squads of men were falling into the ranks in
front of the town-hall of the cantonal capital&mdash;companies were
formed&mdash;guns were got out&mdash;sappers, engineers, and guards were
in readiness&mdash;officers were at their posts. In the
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page711" id = "page711">711</a></span>
afternoon the first Swiss troops were in march for Basle, and by
midnight the first regiment of Aargau were on the bridge; and by Sunday
night the first division, under Col, Egtoff, with 8,296 men, and 692
horses, besides the staff and guides; and the second division, under
Colonel Salis, with 8,319 men, and 632 men at the same hour had
assembled at Basle and held the roads and streams which led to Bonn. By
Tuesday night, before the Prussian manifest was known in Bonn, the five
divisions of the first Swiss army, with their eleven batteries of
artillery mounting 96 field pieces, and a total force of 37,423 men, and
3,541 horses and 104 staff and guides, were under arms and at their
respective rendezvous; and the President was authorized by the Council
to announce to all concerned, “that any troops belonging to belligerent
states, whether regulars or volunteers, who violate the territory of the
Swiss nation, will be repelled by force.”</p>

<p>Out of the officers whose men were first in the field, the Federal
Council placed Colonel Herzog, of the Aargau detachment of the Federal
army, in chief command, and by Saturday night the General’s
head-quarters were established at Alton (the center of the Swiss
railways), where he organized his staff, issued his instructions to
organize two hospitals, one for wounded men, and the other for horses,
and at the same time ordered magazines of stores and clothes to be
established in his rear, and the forces to be moved up to the front. All
railway companies were ordered to report their stock of engines,
carriages, and open wagons, and telegraphic communication was
established for night as well as day service, and engineers were sent
out to study every pass and point by which an enemy in any strength was
likely to enter the territory of Switzerland. When all danger to the
Cantons had passed away in the victories of the German arms, Gen. Herzog
was directed to raise his camps, and send to their several Cantons their
respective troops. Later in the war, when it was authentically known
that Bourbaki was moving an army of 150,000 strong, to sweep across the
Rhine; and still later, that the Germans meant to push the French, in
either whole or part, across the Swiss frontier, and put them out of
service for the rest of the war&mdash;General Herzog satisfied the
President and the Council, and the Minister of War, of the impending
danger, and on Thursday, Jan. 19th, the third, fourth, and fifth
divisions, with two batteries of mountain guns, well prepared for winter
service in a district lying under snow, were ordered out; and in one
week from that date, these forces were distributed through the various
passes in the Jura, from Basle to Geneva, with orders to repel, or
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page712" id = "page712">712</a></span>
receive&mdash;to fight, or feed and lodge, according to the spirit in
which the broken detachments of the French army should present
themselves. For the enormous number (83,301), who laid down their arms,
food and beds were distributed in the Swiss Cantons, by less than 20,000
citizen troops, without the forfeit of a single life. And when their
work was done, these citizen soldiers laid aside their arms and uniforms
and returned to their shops and industries of various kinds, to earn
their daily bread, without forgetting for a moment their civic rights
and household duties.</p>

<p>If the occasion had required it, as it did in the war of Secession in
1856, each Canton would have contributed 30 men from every 1,000
inhabitants, to the Elite, and 15 men to every 1,000 to the Reserve; and
in case of danger to the Union, every male Switzer, from the age of
nineteen to forty-five, not included in either of the above forces,
would have obeyed the summons of the national authority for the
Landwehr, adding 97,934 to the ranks, besides volunteering above and
below the military age, to the number of 100,000 men, who, in case of a
defensive war, could have been relied on,&mdash;all familiar with
military tactics, and accustomed to obey as soldiers, as well as to the
use of arms.</p>

<p>According to recent official statistics the strength of the several
armies of Switzerland is as follows:</p>

<p>The system of recruiting, drilling and brigading, is
local&mdash;which brings neighbors and friends into camp and field
companionship, and inspires a sense of trust and coöperation.</p>

<p>The cost of the reliable military force is as follows:</p>
