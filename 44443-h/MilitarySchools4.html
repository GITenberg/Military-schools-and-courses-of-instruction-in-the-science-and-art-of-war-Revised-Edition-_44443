SYSTEM AND EDUCATION IN ENGLAND.</a></h3>

<p><span class = "firstword">The</span> British army originated in the
feudal system, by which the great barons were bound to furnish a
contingent to the army of the State; and their vassals were bound to
attend them in person, and to furnish each the contributions in men,
horses, arms, and other materials of war, for which he was liable by the
tenure on which he held his lands. When regal power absorbed the
privileges of the great feudatories, the people were expected to provide
themselves with arms, and, in case of invasion, to respond to the
summons issued through officers commissioned by the sovereign to array
the fittest men for service in each county. In the time of Henry VIII,
lord-lieutenants and deputy-lieutenants of counties were first appointed
as standing officers for assembling and mustering the military forces.
For a time, contracts were made with “captains,” who undertook to
provide, clothe, and feed a certain number of fighting men for a given
money allowance. In the reign of Charles I, the important question
arose, whether the King of England did or did not possess the right to
maintain a military force without the express consent of Parliament.
Charles II, was compelled to abandon all control of the army, except a
body guard of 5,000 men, sanctioned by Parliament. These regiments still
exist, and are proud of their genealogy. They are the First Foot Guards,
Coldstream Guards, Life Guard, Oxford Blues, the Royal Scots, and the
Second Queen’s <ins class = "correction"
title = "text has superfluous close quote">Royals.</ins><a class = "tag" name = "tag8_1" id = "tag8_1"
href = "#note8_1">1</a> The Declaration of Rights, in the time of
William and Mary, settled in positive terms “that the raising and
keeping of a standing army in time of peace, without consent of
Parliament, is contrary to law.” The first Mustering Act was passed in
1689, to last for six months; but it has been annually renewed ever
since, except in three particular years; and it constitutes the only
warrant on which the whole military system of England is exercised by
the sovereign with the consent of Parliament. For 172 years, with only
three interruptions, the ministers of the crown have
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page520" id = "page520">520</a></span>
annually applied to Parliament for permission to raise a military force
and for money to defray expenses. The sovereign can make war and bestow
military employment and honors; but the House of Commons can refuse
supplies.</p>

<p>Military service in England is voluntary, except in rare cases, and
then only in the militia. As the chances of promotion from the ranks are
small, the recruits are drawn from the most necessitous classes of the
community, or the least fitted for industrial pursuits. The system of
recruiting, with the bounty and machinery of deception is the most
characteristic feature of the British army as compared with those of
Europe, and makes the distinction between officers and men more broad
than in any other service.</p>

<p>The British army, in its completeness, is theoretically commanded by
the sovereign, assisted by the secretary of state for war in some
matters, and by the commander-in-chief in others. The component parts
are the household troops, the infantry of the line, the ordnance corps,
comprising artillery and engineers, and the marines. There are also
certain corps, raised and belonging to the principal colonies; the
troops in India; the yeomanry cavalry; the dockyard battalions; the
volunteer artillery and rifles; the enrolled pensioners, etc. In 1814,
the regular army reached 200,000, and at the close of the war, 10,000
officers were retained on half pay. In 1860-61, in the army estimates,
provision was made for the following force, viz.:</p>

<p>In England and Wales the Militia Establishment comprises 42
regiments, with 5,066 officers; in Scotland, 16 regiments and 670
officers; in Ireland, 48 regiments, with 3,463 officers.</p>

<p>By Act of 1870, in case of invasion, rebellion, or insurrection, or
of imminent danger thereof, the Militia, in pursuance of an order of Her
Majesty in council, can be called out (the whole or any part) and
embodied for actual service; but when so called out, her proclamation
must be communicated to Parliament within ten days. By recent Royal
Warrant, a lieutenant of the Militia is made eligible to appointment of
sub-lieutenant in the Regular Army, and in the localization of the
military force of the United Kingdom, the Militia, Yeomanry and
Volunteers, are to be brought into closer connection with the Regular
Army.</p>

<p>The total cost of the British army, voted by Parliament in 1870-71,
was £13,093,500, besides a supplementary vote of £2,000,000 towards
defraying the expenses of the military and naval services of the
kingdom. Of the regular expenses, it appears from official statements
that £893,200 were for the Militia and Inspection service; £81,900 for
the Yeomanry; £412,400 for volunteers; and £76,000 for enrolled
pensioners and army reserve force.</p>

<p>The Mercantile Marine of the United Kingdom in number of vessels,
their registered tonnage, and men employed, together with the value of
property and number of passengers transported in them, exceeds that of
any other country. The total number of vessels in the home and foreign
trade, registered in 1869, was 21,881, with a tonnage of 5,575,303,
employing 202,477 men, and freighted with imports and exports to the
total value of 532,475,266<i>l.</i></p>

<p>All matters relating to merchant ships and seamen, and the mercantile
marine generally, are committed to the general superintendence of the
Board of Trade, which, as constituted in 1786, is composed of certain
high officers, (members of the Privy Council), and its President is a
Cabinet officer. To this Board all consular officers, all officers of
customs abroad, and all local marine boards and shipping masters must
make reports in matter and form as required. Inspectors, duly appointed
by this Board, may visit any ship, examine any registry, machinery,
boats, equipments, &amp;c., to ascertain if they are conformable to law.
In every seaport a Shipping Master is appointed by the Local Marine
Board, who must keep register of names and character of seamen,
facilitate their engagement and discharge, as well as the apprenticeship
of boys to sea-service. The Local Board must provide for the examination
of persons who intend to become masters or mates according to rules laid
down by the Board of Trade. And to such as pass a satisfactory
examination as to sobriety, experience, ability, and general good
conduct on board ship, shall be given a certificate of competency; and
to those who have served as masters or mates, under certain conditions,
a certificate of service with specifications must be given. Shipping
Masters must assist, when applied to by parents or guardians, or masters
of ships, in apprenticing boys to the sea-service. No person can be
employed as master or mate, who does not hold a certificate of
competency, and under certain conditions, of service. Opportunities of
preparing for these examinations are now provided in all the large
seaports, in Navigation Schools; and the Government, through the
Department of Science and Arts, encourages the study of astronomy,
navigation, steam and steam machinery, and other branches, which are
serviceable to officers in command of vessels, whether propelled by
sails or engines, by making appropriations of money to schools according
to the number of pupils who pass satisfactory examinations in these
studies.</p>

<p><span class = "firstword">The</span> following account of the
institutions for military education in England is abridged from an
article in <i>Blackwood’s Magazine</i> for November, 1858:</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>There exist in this country three military seminaries&mdash;the Royal
Military Academy at Woolwich, where youths are educated for service in
the Artillery and Engineers; the Royal Military College at Sandhurst,
where cadets are prepared for the Infantry and Cavalry; and the
Honorable East India Company’s Military School at Addiscombe, which
educates simultaneously for the Artillery, Engineers, and Infantry
services of the three Presidencies. Supplementary to these are the
School of Practical Instruction at Chatham, where passed cadets from
Woolwich and Addiscombe learn practical engineering; and the senior
department at Sandhurst, supposed to be a Staff school, into which
officers of infantry and cavalry are, under certain restrictions,
admitted.</p>

<p>I. The Military Academy at Woolwich came into existence in the year
1741. It was created by George II., to supply a want under which the
English army then suffered, by giving some instructions in matters
connected with their respective arts to officers and men who served in
the Artillery and in the Engineers. Its beginnings were of the humblest
imaginable order. A&nbsp;single room in a house at Woolwich, where the
Board of Ordnance used occasionally to assemble, was set apart by
Government as a hall of study; and two masters were appointed to give
lectures by rotation, during four consecutive hours, in three days of
every week. At first only the officers of the single battalion composing
the English Artillery and of the corps of Engineers were required to
attend. By and by the room was thrown open to the non-commissioned
officers and privates also, and eventually the cadets, of whom five were
supposed to be on the strength of each company of Artillery, repaired
thither in like manner. But the cadets being the sons of the officers of
the corps, as they neither dressed in uniform, nor were under any
military control, proved very difficult to manage; and the difficulty
led to a great change as well in their condition as in that of the
Academy itself.</p>

<p>In the year 1744 the cadets were, for the first time, clothed in
uniform, and collected into a distinct company. Two officers, with a
drum-major, undertook the management of them; and the arrangement
worked, or was supposed to work, so satisfactorily, that by little and
little, as the regiment enlarged itself, the numbers composing the Cadet
Company were increased also. In 1782 they had grown from twenty to
sixty; in 1798 to a hundred; after which steps were taken to lodge and
board, as well as to educate and drill them, apart from the residences
of their fathers. Hence, after trying for a while to accommodate some in
a separate barrack, while others were billeted on private persons at a
payment of 2s. a day per head, the pile which now attracts the attention
of the passer-by on Woolwich Common was erected. And by the addition of
a lieutenant-governor, and a whole host of officers and professors, it
grew into the sort of establishment which is familiar to most of us. In
1806 the staff of officers and teachers appointed to the Cadet Company
consisted of&mdash;</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>1.&nbsp;Lieutenant-Governor; 2.&nbsp;Inspector; 3.&nbsp;Professor of
Mathematics; 4.&nbsp;Professor of Fortification; 5.&nbsp;Mathematical

15.&nbsp;Second do.: 16.&nbsp;Clerk.</p>
</div>

<p>In 1829 the fencing and dancing masters were discontinued, and a
chemical lecturer appointed. In 1836 three new masters were added; and
in 1857 the staff stood thus:</p>

</div>

<p>Admittance to the Academy was, till very lately, obtained only on the
nomination of the Master-General of the Ordnance. There was a
preliminary examination, it is true; but this all except the dullest
might calculate on passing, and the ages of entrance ranged between
fourteen and sixteen. In 1835 the minimum age was raised to fifteen, the
maximum to seventeen; while candidates were called up to compete for
admission in the proportion of four youths for every three vacancies.
The arrangement did not avail to produce any radical change in the
spirit of the institution. The preliminary examination still proved to
be a “pass,” and no more; and so it continued till those political views
obtained the ascendant which abolished altogether the office of
Master-General and Board of Ordnance, and gave us in their place a
Secretary of State for the War Department.</p>

<p>Occasions had arisen, even under the old regime, when young men were
permitted to enter the service of the Artillery under what may be called
exceptional conditions. During the pressure of the great war of the
French Revolution, the demand for officers became at one time so urgent,
that it was found necessary to dispense with a regular academical
education, and to give commissions to candidates who were pronounced by
competent examiners sufficiently conversant with mathematics and
physical science to enter upon the practical duties of their profession.
Lord Panmure, taking advantage of the precedent thus furnished, threw
open Artillery commissions in 1855, and has continued ever since to
treat admission into the Royal Military Academy as a prize for which the
youth of the United Kingdom may freely compete.</p>

<p>The subjects of study to be pursued in the Royal Military Academy at
Woolwich, not less than the mode of dealing with them, and the
text-books to be used, have hitherto been prescribed to the most minute
particular by regulation. They embrace Mathematics, Fortification,
Descriptive Geometry, French, German, Plan-Drawing, Geometrical Drawing,
Landscape Drawing, History and Geography; to which, during his
continuance in what are called the “theoretical classes,” the attention
of the cadet is confined. When he enters the “practical class,” the
student is instructed, over and above, in Practical Artillery, Surveying
and Field-Works, and attends lectures in Astronomy, Chemistry, Geology,
and Mineralogy. As many as five years may be spent by a young man in
going over this course&mdash;viz., four years in the “theoretical,” and
one year in the “practical” class&mdash;though the average period of
actual residence does not appear to exceed two years and a half or three
years. There are periodical examinations at the end of every half-year,
the second of which, by its results, determines whether the young man
shall be allowed to go on to a commission, or be removed from the
Academy.</p>

<p>The moral tone of this military college has never, we regret to say,
been of a very high order. Excellent men have been at the head of it,
and the ability of the professors and teachers appointed to instruct
admits of no question. Yet few right-minded officers look back upon the
years spent in the cadet barracks except with disgust. It is not very
difficult to account for the circumstance. Long after Continental
nations had seen the absurdity of pressing upon boys the sort of
training which belongs to men, we refused to be guided by their
experience, and persisted, both at Woolwich and elsewhere, in our
endeavor to accomplish an impossibility. “Boys of fourteen, fifteen, and
sixteen,” says a very high authority on this subject, “require much
personal supervision in order to form their characters, which young
officers, very often appointed without any sufficient knowledge of their
tempers and habits, cannot be expected to bestow. Such officers may
indeed be able to superintend drill, but not moral training. Rarely do
they draw the cadets towards them, and become their advisers; more
frequently repel them by a harsh dictatorial manner, the cadet being in
their eyes a soldier. There has been also, during all the time I have
known the Academy, great inconsistency in treating the cadets. Honor is
constantly
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page527" id = "page527">527</a></span>
talked of, and yet doubts as to their truthfulness are not unfrequently
expressed. I&nbsp;have heard even the lie given in rough and emphatic
terms. Confidence is professedly placed, and yet offences are found out
in a way that shows that no confidence existed. Hence a contest arises
between the officer and cadet, and the latter becomes tricky and
disingenuous.”</p>

<p>In these emphatic words Colonel Portlock has struck at the root of
most of the evil which has long been felt, and heretofore combated
without success, in the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich. Whatever is
wanting in the morale of that establishment, it owes to the original sin
of its constitution. We know how to deal with boys so long as we
recognize their boyhood, even while appealing to the point of honor
among them. But we no sooner dress them up in uniform, and affect to
treat them as soldiers, than we lose all moral control over them. They
smoke, drink, swear, and fall into other vices, not because they are
overcome by any irresistible temptation, but because they look upon such
acts as tokens of manhood. And the corporals, who report readily enough
for insubordination, and the officers, who punish for what they call
military offences, take little heed of worse things; partly because, in
a military point of view, they are scarcely criminal; partly because,
not being regarded as such, they are seldom brought under the notice of
the superior authorities. How a seminary so conducted and so managed
should have given to the Artillery and Engineers a body of officers
distinguished, as those of both arms unquestionably are for talent,
intelligence, and gentlemanly bearing, would be inexplicable, were not
the fact well known, that one of the first lessons taught to the young
lieutenant, after quitting the Academy, is to throw off the habits which
he had contracted there, and to adopt the high moral tone and excellent
habits of his regiment.</p>

<p>It was partly with a view to provide a palliative for this admitted
evil, partly to encourage in our young Artillery officers the habit of
sustained study, that they were required, by a recent regulation, <ins
class = "correction"
title = "mismatched open quote in original">“to</ins> place themselves under the orders of a director of
studies for half a year after obtaining their commissions. Meanwhile
cadets who are appointed to the Engineers proceed to the training-school
for that arm at Chatham; where they go through a somewhat careful course
of surveying, and are instructed less elaborately in architecture, civil
as well as military, and in mining, sapping, pontooning, and so forth.
According to the report of the Commissioners, it does not appear that
they reach their new field of instruction over and above well prepared
to make the most of it. Indeed, the whole of the Woolwich system is by
these gentlemen condemned in terms as decided as is consistent with good
breeding.</p>

<p>II. It was not till the year 1804 that the propriety of training
young men in ever so slight a degree for the service of the infantry and
cavalry, seems to have occurred to any statesman or soldier in this
country. Appointments to both arms took place for a time by purchase
only, and by and by, when the numbers of the rank and file increased,
through the weight of influence, personal, political, or social.
Moreover, when the pressure of the great war was at its height, a third
door of entrance to military rank was opened, and ensigncies and
captaincies, and even lieutenant-colonelcies, became the prize of
private gentlemen who were able to bring certain fixed contingents of
able-bodied men under the royal standard. So far as the candidates for
commissions themselves were concerned, however, the same even-handed
justice was meted out to all. Nobody took the trouble to inquire whether
the candidates were qualified morally, intellectually, or physically. He
might be a pimp and blockhead, or lame, or deaf, or blind; but so long
as his patron had the ear of the Government, or the men whom he brought
with him were able to pass muster, his commission, whatever it might be,
was secure.</p>

<p>The Military College at Sandhurst consisted at first, as it still
consists, of two departments&mdash;one, called the Junior Department,
for cadets&mdash;the other, the Senior Department, for officers desirous
of qualifying for the Staff. But it had, in its original constitution,
this marked advantage over the arrangement which has since been
effected, that whereas now cadets and officers occupy portions of the
same range of buildings, and come under the instruction
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page528" id = "page528">528</a></span>
of the same professors, they were, in 1804 placed, the one at Marlow,
the other at Highwickam&mdash;each class of students having its own
teachers, though both were subject to the control and management of the
same military administration.</p>

<p>As first constituted, the junior department afforded both an asylum
and a place of education for the sons of officers exclusively. Youths
once admitted ceased to be a burden to their friends, except for the
necessary expenses of travelling; they were housed, clothed, and
educated at the public expense. But no sooner was the great war ended
than Parliament began to slacken in its gratitude to the army, and by
little and little the grants for military education fell off, till in
the end they ceased altogether. As a necessary consequence, the numbers
of persons seeking education at the Military College fell off in like
manner. And now the junior department exhibits a muster-roll of 180
cadets only, while the strength of the senior department has dwindled to
nine individuals. To be sure, other causes than the withdrawal of public
support from the institution have operated to produce this latter
result. Whatever it might have been forty years ago, the senior
department at Sandhurst is certainly no Staff school now. Indeed, the
only science effectively taught there seems to be mathematics; and it is
a curious fact, that though the army abounds with officers who have
passed through that school, and taken high honors, the instances are
rare in which Staff appointments have fallen to the lot of any of
them.</p>

<p>Lads are admitted into the junior department at Sandhurst between the
ages of thirteen and fifteen. The preliminary examination is of the most
trivial kind, and the instruction communicated is, for half the course,
that of a common school not of the highest order. No doubt each youth
may, if he be disposed, master more than the elements of a good deal of
science; for over and above physical geography and history, instruction
is given in practical astronomy, dynamics, and statics, practical
mechanics, co-ordinate geometry, the differential and integral calculus,
trigonometry and mensuration, Euclid’s Geometry, attack and defence of
fortresses, practical field-fortification, course of military surveying,
the Latin, French, and German languages. Unfortunately, however, there
is no compulsion to study, nor any inducement, unless the youth aspire
to win for himself a commission without purchase.</p>

<p>III. The Hon. East India Company’s College at Addiscombe approaches
nearer in its constitution and objects to what a military school ought
to be, than any other of which we can boast in this country. It came
into existence in 1818, previously to which date the Directors were in
the habit of sending to Woolwich, for instruction, youths to whom they
had given cadetships in the Company’s Artillery and Engineers. When
first founded, it was intended as a place of training exclusively for
these young gentlemen; but the benefits derived from it became so
obvious and so great that the Court of Directors gradually enlarged its
views, and now young men are educated at Addiscombe not only for the
Company’s Artillery and Engineers, but for their infantry also. And
herein it is that the Directors have mixed up evil with good. They
consider an Engineer cadetship as their great prize, and next to that a
cadetship of Artillery; and they select for these appointments, not the
youths who may have exhibited special talents for either arm, but the
best men, or the men reported as generally best, of their batch. The
consequence is, that to the infantry&mdash;for good service in which
talent is as much required as for either the Artillery or
Engineers&mdash;the idlers of the College are appointed, while many a
clever lad, who would have shone as an infantry officer, becomes an
indifferent engineer or gunner, simply because he has been posted to an
arm for the practical operation of which he has no genius.</p>

<p>In all other respects the Military School at Addiscombe may be fairly
said to surpass both Woolwich and Sandhurst. In the first place, youths
enter there almost invariably at a more mature age. Though eligible for
admission after completing their fifteenth year, they seldom, if ever,
come up for examination till after they have turned seventeen. In the
next place, the entrance examination is more severe than either at
Woolwich or Sandhurst;
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page529" id = "page529">529</a></span>
and in the third and last place&mdash;and this is the most important
condition of the whole&mdash;cadets must complete their course at
Addiscombe in two years, unless for special reasons, such as sickness,
they be allowed to prolong their stay one half-year more. Now, lads may
linger on at Woolwich four, and even five years, gaining this remarkable
advantage from their stupidity, that when forced to compete at last for
choice between Artillery and Engineers, they compete with youths who may
have had but two years’ training. And at Sandhurst, the course which
nominally covers four years, may, if the youth have interest at
headquarters, be completed, as far as his appointment to a commission
completes it, in four months.</p>

<p>The general education given at Addiscombe is certainly not inferior
to that which the cadets receive either at Woolwich or at Sandhurst. It
embraces, indeed, almost entirely the same subjects which are set down
in the curriculum of the others&mdash;including lectures in geology,
chemistry, and artillery. But it undeniably falls short in specialties.
Hence, after completing his course at Addiscombe, the Company’s cadet
intended for the Engineers proceeds to Chatham, where, side by side with
young men from Woolwich, he receives practical instruction in his art.
For the Artillery cadet, on the other hand, there is no practical
school. Like his comrade intended for the service of the Infantry, he
proceeds at once from Addiscombe to India, and learns there how to turn
to account the theoretical lessons which have been communicated to him
at home.</p>

<p>Another distinction deserves to be noted between the constitution of
the school of Addiscombe, and that as well of the Royal Military College
as of the Royal Military Academy: Though all alike put from them the
eleemosynary element, at Addiscombe alone is strict impartiality in the
matter of payments observed. The youth who enters there, whether he be
the son of an earl or of a subaltern’s widow, must be provided with his
£100 a year, besides about £25 more to cover the cost of books,
instruments, and uniforms. Both at Woolwich and Sandhurst there is a
graduated scale, which exacts more from a general officer than from a
subaltern, and more from a civilian than from either. The orphan of an
officer dying in poor circumstances is admitted into Woolwich on payment
of £20 a year. He pays for similar privileges at Sandhurst £40.&nbsp;The
son of a gentleman in civil life pays in both cases £125, a sum more
than necessary to cover the expenses of his own board and education, but
which is exacted in order that there may be a surplus out of which the
deficiencies occasioned by the payments of the sons of officers shall be
made good.</p>
</div>

<p>Most important changes in the system of Military Education in England
have been introduced since 1855, by Lord Panmure and the Council of
Military Education, inaugurated under his auspices.</p>

<p>1. Admission to the various Military Schools is now gained by open
competitive examination.</p>

<p>2. The order and method of studies, and all examinations for
promotion, are governed by an independent Board of competent officers,
and men of service, called the Council of Military Education.</p>

<p>3. The amount and order of studies in each school are minutely
arranged, and each Professor is kept to the prescribed course by the
supervision of a Master of Studies.</p>

<p>4. The development of the Staff School has given completeness to the
system.</p>

<!-- where are I II ? -->
<p>M. Alphonse Esquiros, in the <i>Révue des Deux Mondes</i> of
September 1860, contributes two articles on the military schools and
institutions of England, from which we make a few extracts:</p>


<div class = "in-one">
<p class = "smallhead">THE MILITARY SPIRIT AND PREPARATION OF
ENGLAND.</p>

<p>On what foundation is the assertion based that England is only a
first-class naval power? Although never numerous, have not the English
soldiers sufficed for all the great eventualities of history? Has not
the weight of their arms been felt for centuries past in the balance in
which are weighed the destinies of the Continent? Each time that it was
necessary to conquer, have they not conquered? I will not awaken
irritating recollections. I&nbsp;will not mention the name of a great
battle so painful to our national self-love; it will suffice to recall
the fact, that recently, England, with a handful of men, has reconquered
India. Instead of denying history, it were better to ask by what links
the British character is connected with the group of martial nations.
The Englishman is not warlike from inclination; he does not love war for
war’s sake, or maintain an army for the ruinous pleasure of seeing
bayonets glitter and banners flaunt. He has an army to defend his
territory, his commerce, the immense net-work of his external relations
and possessions. Experience has more than once shown him the necessity
of placing the pride of riches under the protection of courage. The
Englishman has less enthusiasm than coolness. Immovable when attacked,
he feels that the responsibility of the labor which has made England an
opulent nation rests upon his arms. The military element, therefore,
presents in Great Britain peculiar and interesting features. And then,
quite recently, besides the regular army, a new independent army has
arisen. Yesterday, it existed but as a project; to-day, it fills the
towns with the blast of its clarions, passes review in Hyde Park and
Holyrood, and covers the plains with the smoke of its skirmishers.
I&nbsp;speak of the volunteers, or riflemen. We must investigate the
origin of this movement, and the influence it has already exercised on
English habits; but before busying ourselves with the army and
volunteers, it will be well to study the military schools and
arsenals.</p>


<p class = "smallhead">REFORMS IN MILITARY EDUCATION AND PROMOTION IN
1856.</p>

<p>The delay and disasters of the operations before Sebastopol aroused
the attention of the press and the people to the manner in which
officers for the army were trained, appointed, and promoted. The
Government was aroused by the emotions of the country, and in 1856, a
commission was appointed by Lord Panmure, Secretary of War, to
reorganize the education of the officers. That commission visited the
different military schools of Great Britain, visited similar
institutions in France, Prussia, Austria, and Sardinia, and collected
all documents of a nature to enlighten it researches. Its report is a
monument of science, and art, and impartiality. The authors of that
investigation, Col. Yolland, Col. Mythe, and Mr. Lake, of the Oxford
University, pointed out what reform ought to be made in the English
system to raise the establishment of military education to the level of
the inevitable progress claimed by the present age. They recommended a
Council of Military Education, which, placed beyond and above the
educating body, should direct the studies of the young men destined
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page531" id = "page531">531</a></span>
for the army. From these various influences&mdash;the pressure of public
opinion, the commission appointed in 1856 by the Government, and
especially the Council of Military Education, arose those happy changes,
which we shall endeavor to point out in the military institutions of
Great Britain.</p>

<p class = "smallhead">ROYAL MILITARY ACADEMY AT WOOLWICH.</p>

<p>Before 1855, the candidates were named by the master-general of
ordnance; and although there was an entrance examination, the
requisitions were very elementary, and no youth, influentially connected
or recommended, was rejected. The results, although the institution
furnished some good engineers and artillery officers to the English
army, were not satisfactory. Since 1855 the system of appointment and
instruction has been re-organized. Appointment on nomination has given
place to open competition. A&nbsp;ministerial circular made an appeal to
all candidates desirous of entering the academy without distinction of
class, or party. Public examinations thrown open to the youth of
England, with independent examinations, succeeded the private
examinations within the college walls. The axe was laid at the tree of
privilege, and personal merit was substituted in its place.</p>

<p>The entrance examinations take place twice, a year, at Chelsea
Hospital&mdash;the home of disabled soldiers, and the school of orphan
soldiers’ children&mdash;in a large hall hung with the captured trophies
and battle flags of different nations. The programme embraces
mathematics, simple and practical; history, geography, and English
literature; the Greek and Latin classics; the French language and
literature; German, chemistry, and physics; mineralogy and geology;
geometrical and landscape drawing. To each subject a certain numerical
value is assigned. Each candidate is limited to five subjects, including
mathematics, which he may select out of the programme, and on his
obtaining an aggregate as well as relative number of marks depends his
success. The results are made public, and the unsuccessful candidates
are allowed another trial to fill succeeding vacancies. Then
examinations exercise an indirect but elevating influence upon the
schools of the country which send forth the candidates. Competition has
put a check upon ignorance and mediocrity, no matter how well backed by
social and political influence.</p>

<p>Another reform, not less important than that of competition, or the
system of nominations, was that order of the minister of war,
lengthening the age for the admission of candidates. That age was fixed
between 16 and 20.&nbsp;The inconvenience of submitting young men too
soon to military discipline has been recognized with great wisdom by
Gen. Portlock.<a class = "tag" name = "tag8_2" id = "tag8_2" href =
"#note8_2">2</a> “The character of adolescents exacts,” he says, “a more
delicate cultivation than that which must be expected from officers
imbued with the command of a military school. In their eyes, no matter
how young he is, the pupil is a soldier, and they treat him almost as
one. Doubtless they excel in drilling him well; but do they possess the
necessary qualities and experience for forming the morals of youth?”
Another consequence of the early admissions was the introduction of a
sort of confusion and uncertainty in the system of teaching. Now, a
distinct line is drawn between the course of studies which precede and
which follow admission to the academy. The conclusion was come to that a
military academy formed a sort of line of demarcation in life between a
good general education which ends, and a professional service which
commences. The character, mind, manners of the candidate
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page532" id = "page532">532</a></span>
are supposed to be formed according to the usages of the world; he has
reached that age when a man knows himself, and looks out for a
career.</p>

<p>It is needless to dwell on the course of instruction, which is now
nearly the same in all the great military schools of Europe. There are
thirty-five professors, many of them eminent in their respective
departments. One leading object, both of instruction and discipline, is
to cultivate the habit of self-improvement and self-government. Physical
sports are practiced and encouraged, and the cadets frequently challenge
the officers of the garrison to a match of cricket.</p>

<p>An examination takes place every six months, in which the progress of
each cadet is ascertained and reported. Those who pass through the
series in good standing are promoted to a commission; the most
distinguished to the engineer corps, and the others to the artillery.
The appointment of these young officers gives rise to an interesting
ceremony. The Duke of Cambridge, with a numerous staff, visits Woolwich
Academy twice a year. All the cadets are present in review in front of
the monument. It is pleasing to see how admirably they go through the
manœuvres. The duke then enters a hall where a <i>viva voce</i>
examination takes place on the art of fortification. This over, the
cadets form in square, and the duke then advances to the table where the
prizes are laid out. These prizes consist of a sword of honor,
telescopes, mathematical instruments, and books. The President of the
Council of Education reads out the names of the cadets of the first
class who are to receive commissions in the engineers and artillery. In
conclusion, the Duke of Cambridge addresses some parental words to the
young men who are about to leave the academy to enter the army. Such is
a brief account of this academical festival, to which the brilliancy of
the uniforms, the rank and names of the assistants, the happy emotions
on the faces of the young men, impress a character of charm and
solemnity.</p>


<p class = "smallhead">MILITARY COLLEGE AT ADDISCOMBE.</p>

<p>Addiscombe was formerly the residence of the Earl of Liverpool, but
was converted into a school at an expense of $40,000, by the East India
Company. Within a few years it has passed into the hands of the
Government. One of the first acts of the Secretary of War and Council of
Military Education was to inaugurate a system of admission (which was
open by patronage of members of the company) by competitive examination,
and which has been attended with the happiest results. After passing a
year at Addiscombe, the cadets enter according to merit (ascertained by
examination) and either enter the engineers, artillery, or line service.
The India service will always remain distinct and sought after; that
life of adventures, encampments in the jungles, tiger hunts, the
attraction of struggles against man and nature, the dazzling figures of
a world shining in the east through the fogs of Great Britain, all this
responds to one feature of the English character, the love of
adventure.</p>


<p class = "smallhead">ROYAL COLLEGE OF SANDHURST.</p>

<p>Here are two distinct institutions&mdash;the college, which is a
preparatory school for infantry and cavalry officers, and the <i>senior
department</i>, or staff school. The scholars of the last department,
who have already gone through the competitive examination, are
commissioned officers; they have even served a certain number of years
in the army; some of them have gone through the Crimean war and the
Indian campaign. In 1859, one of these officers had received eighteen
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page533" id = "page533">533</a></span>
or nineteen wounds, which had deprived him of one of his eyes.
I&nbsp;was surprised at finding among them candidates for staff
appointments who could write and speak French in a manner that would
have done honor to a French officer.</p>

<p>The English find it an advantage to admit young officers of talent
and energy into the higher branches of the service. To the experience of
their profession, their picked soldiers add knowledge already acquired,
which a second course of education develops and consolidates. It must,
however, be admitted that it requires a certain moral strength to
return, after having held a command, to the benches of a school, to
follow various studies, and to submit to strict examinations, which
exclude all ideas of promotion and favor, fortune or birth.</p>

<p>In an economical point of view, these two institutions, Woolwich and
Sandhurst, cover their own expenses without any cost to the State. This
fact, which was by no means foreseen, is owing to two measures
relatively of recent date&mdash;the gradual withdrawal of subsidies
formerly granted by Parliament, and the accession of the sons of rich
men not belonging to the army; these latter pay a high premium, and thus
contribute towards the education of the other cadets, who, being sons of
officers, enjoy certain immunities. In England, it is thought equitable
that the services of the father should be counted in favor of the son;
according to this principle, the debt contracted by the country towards
military men is paid to their sons by civilians.</p>

<p>Young men who have not passed through Sandhurst may, nevertheless, be
admitted as officers into the line or cavalry, but on the condition of
undergoing an examination and <i>purchasing</i> their commissions. This
purchasing of direct commissions is doubtless detrimental to Sandhurst
College. The abolition of the system has often been mooted. The Duke of
Cambridge approves of the abolition, as does the Minister of War, and
wishes that no officer shall be admitted into the English army except
from a military college.</p>


<p class = "smallhead">COUNCIL OF MILITARY EDUCATION.</p>

<p>So far we only behold the members of a great system. There is unity
in the Council of Military Education, which to a certain extent is the
head of instruction. The influence of their council, which consists of
eminent men, is felt in the different schools, introduces changes and
useful reforms, directs the public examinations&mdash;in a word, gives
the impulse to the military studies of the United Kingdom. The civil and
religious element is represented therein by one of the most learned men
of England (the Rev. Henry Mosley, canon.) The other members are
generals and colonels belonging to different corps of the army.</p>

<p>Thus it will be seen that England enjoys a system of military
education which will bear comparison with that of any other nation in
Europe. The chief purposes of this system are a good general instruction
up to the age of sixteen or nineteen years, then a short military
instruction, then, after some years of service, a final course of
studies in the senior department or staff college. It must not, however,
be supposed that the present state of things, though happily modified by
the recent principle of competition, is the extreme limit of progress.
In the name of liberty, I&nbsp;am too anxious that Great Britain should
maintain her position in the world, to pay a full compliment to her
self-esteem and enslumber her aspirations for reform. She has done much
in these latter times; but there is still much to be done, and she is
aware of it, to raise the moral power of her officers to the level of
modern times, where enlightenment pervades every class of society.</p>

<h4><a name = "britain_1871" id = "britain_1871" href =
"#england">MODIFICATIONS IN 1871.</a></h4>

<p>In 1867 a Royal Commission was appointed “to inquire into the Present
state of Military Education and into the Training of Candidates for
Commissions in the Army.” The Report, with the minutes of evidence and
illustrated documents, was quite voluminous, and has been followed with
important changes in both the system of military instruction, and in the
mode of making appointments and promotions in the army, that will be
noted in detail in the following chapters, which are compiled from
historical notices by the Secretary of the Commission, and recent
Regulations for the government of the several schools and the
examinations for appointment and promotions.</p>

<p>The most important measure affecting the British army; after repeated
discussions of the principle, in the last and former Parliaments, and
particularly in the last, on a bill of the Gladstone ministry, in which
the votes of the Commons in favor was overruled by the Lords, was the
abolition of the whole system of purchase and sale of commissions by
Royal Warrant issued July 20, 1871. This radical change was followed
(October&nbsp;30) by a revision of the Queen’s Regulations, in which
original appointments and promotions in the military service are put on
a new basis. Henceforth, commissions of the first grade are to be issued
to sub-lieutenants, for any vacancy occurring:</p>

<p>1. To successful candidates, in the order of merit as ascertained by
competitive examination in general subjects.</p>

<p>2. To graduates of the universities who shall pass a qualifying
examination.</p>

<p>3. To Queen’s Cadets, Indian Cadets, and Pages of Honor, who have
passed successfully the final examination of the Military Academy, or
its equivalent.</p>

<p>4. To non-commissioned officers who are recommended for promotion by
their commanding officers. If more candidates apply than there are
vacancies to be filled, appointment is decided by competition.</p>

<p>5. To a lieutenant of the militia, who shall pass the professional
examination required.</p>

<p>Sub-lieutenants are eligible to promotion only after passing a
professional examination, and only after twelve months’ service with a
regiment, under strict discipline, with liability to be removed for
physical or moral unfitness. Within three years from the date of their
commissions as lieutenants, officers may submit to an examination in
respect to fitness for promotion to captaincies, and any officer failing
to pass within three years, must retire from the army. Lieutenants are
eligible to the rank of captain at any time after two years’ service in
the army, having passed the examination. A&nbsp;captain may be made a
major after two years’ service in the army; and a major is at any time
eligible to a lieutenant-coloneley, which means the command of a
regiment.</p>

<p>Every promotion must now be made on the recommendation of the
Commander-in-Chief, with the approval of the Secretary of State for War;
and from the principles laid down in the Royal Warrant, as will be seen
further on, every precaution is taken to insure a gradual advance by
seniority, and a more rapid rise by meritorious service founded on
intelligent and disinterested tests. By the new Warrant the Militia is
brought into closer connection with the Regular Army. To the abolition
of purchase, and promotion by professional preparation and service, may
be added the autumn field manœuvres, inaugurated in 1871, with 30,000
men, and the localization of the Army, by assigning a corps with staff,
train, men, &amp;c., to territorial divisions of the country.</p>

NOTICE.</a></h5>

<p><span class = "firstword">In</span> the debates which took place in
Parliament during the Crimean war, in the year 1855, attention was
frequently drawn to the necessity of improving the professional
education of officers, and more particularly of providing means of
instruction for, and requiring special qualifications from, those who
were candidates for the staff. In the course of the same year a great
alteration was made in the principles which had hitherto regulated
preparatory instruction for the army, by abandoning, so far as the
scientific corps were concerned, the system of juvenile military
education, and throwing admission to the Artillery and Engineers open to
public competition among candidates whose age would afford the
presumption that their general education was already completed. At the
beginning of 1856 three Commissioners, Lieut.-Colonel Yolland, R.E.,
Lieut.-Colonel Smythe, R.A., and the Rev. W.&nbsp;C. Lake, were
appointed by Lord Panmure, then Secretary of State for War, “to consider
the best mode of reorganizing the system for training officers for the
scientific corps”; and for this purpose were directed to visit the
military schools of France, Prussia, Austria, and Sardinia. The
instructions issued to the Commissioners informed them that it was
already decided that admission to the scientific corps should be
obtained by open competition, and that the age of candidates admitted to
the examination should be from 17 to 20.</p>

<p>While the Commissioners were still engaged in their inquiries, the
question of military education was frequently brought before the notice
of Parliament in the course of the session of 1856, more particularly by
Mr. Sidney Herbert, who, in an elaborate speech on the 5th of June,
explained to the House of Commons the details of a general scheme of
education for officers of all branches of the service, the outline of
which he had previously sketched out while Secretary at War in 1854, in
a letter to the Commander-in-Chief.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page536" id = "page536">536</a></span>
<p>The subject of military education was one which at this time engaged
the serious attention both of the Government and the public. Toward the
close of the year, Major-General Lefroy (then Colonel Lefroy, and
employed at the War Office as artillery adviser to the Secretary of
State) was directed by Lord Panmure to draw up a general scheme for the
education of officers; and numerous plans, with a similar object, were
about the same period proposed for the consideration of the Secretary of
State.</p>

<p>The military educational establishments which existed in 1856 were as

</table>

<p>Up to this period no systematic organization for the direction of
military education had prevailed in this country; the various
educational establishments were under the control of separate
departments, and no single authority exercised any general supervision
over them. The appointment of a Director-General of Military Education
had been already advocated in Parliament by Mr. Sidney Herbert, and the
institution of a special department to superintend the whole system of
education for the army was one of the main features both of Colonel
Lefroy’s and of all the other schemes brought under the consideration of
Lord Panmure at this period.</p>

<p>The Commissioners appointed in 1856, after having visited the
military schools of the Continent, presented their Report in January,
1857. In this Report, although their instructions
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page537" id = "page537">537</a></span>
had more particularly directed their attention to the training of
officers for the scientific corps, they touched upon several points
connected with the education of officers of the army generally. One of
the changes most strongly recommended by them was the formation of a
special Board of Military Education. “We consider it of the first
importance,” their Report says, “that military education in this country
should be regarded as a whole, and that perfect unity of system and
harmony in its working should be made to prevail. This, we conceive, can
only be done by bringing military education generally under the control
of one head, the Secretary of State for War; and to effect this, a Board
or Section of Military Education should be formed, as part of the
establishment of the War Office.” The Report adds: “The creation of such
a Section appears to us far more important than any other single object
we can recommend.” The Commissioners also stated that after careful
consideration, they recommended the combined action of a Board in
preference to the undivided authority of a single individual, on the
ground of the variety of knowledge and experience required for the
proper treatment of educational questions.</p>

<p>The appointment of the Council of Military Education was the first
result of the recommendations of the Commissioners. Its institution was
proposed in a letter from the Commander-in-Chief to the Secretary of
State for War on the 6th of April, 1857, and as originally constituted,
it consisted of the Commander-in-Chief as <i>ex officio</i> president, a
Major-General as vice-president, and two field officers as members. The
appointment of the Council, although the members commenced their duties
at once, was not officially gazetted until June.</p>

<p>The functions of the Council, however, did not in the first instance
extend to a general superintendence over the whole system of military
education. Almost simultaneously with their institution an
Inspector-General of Army Schools was appointed under the Secretary of
State for War, to whom the management of all institutions connected with
the education of soldiers and children, which had previously been in the
hands of the Chaplain-General, was entrusted. Nor was the supervision of
the Council even over the education of officers at first general, as the
Royal Military Academy at Woolwich remained under the management of the
War Office (under which department it had been placed on the abolition
of the
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page538" id = "page538">538</a></span>
office of Master-General of the Ordnance), and the examinations for
admission to it were conducted by a separate Board of Examiners, under
the superintendence of Canon Moseley.</p>

<p>The instructions issued to the Council on their first appointment
directed their attention more especially to the organization of a Staff
College, the revision of the system of examinations for direct
appointments to the army, the amalgamation of Woolwich and Sandhurst,
and the professional instruction and examination of officers after
entering the service. On all these questions they submitted reports in
the course of the year, and at the beginning of 1858 they commenced to
conduct the examinations in connection with the Staff College and the
Cadet College at Sandhurst, although these establishments were not
formally put under their authority until, by a Royal Warrant of the 1st
of October, 1858, the Council were appointed Visitors of the Royal
Military College. The examinations of officers for direct appointments
to the staff, which had been instituted in 1857, were also placed under
the superintendence of the Council in 1858; but at a later period, the
portion of these examinations which has more especial reference to
matters of drill and regimental duty was, on the recommendation of the
Council themselves, removed from their control, with the view of its
being conducted by a Board of Officers appointed by the
Adjutant-General.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the year 1858, the office of Secretary to the
Council of Military Education was created, and in June of the same year
an augmentation of their number took place by the addition of two new
members,&mdash;one a field officer, the other a civilian, the Rev. Canon
Moseley. The constitution of the Council as then fixed continues to the
present day, and consists of the Commander-in-Chief as <i>ex officio</i>
president, a vice-president, and four members, one being a civilian.</p>

<p>The appointment of a civilian as a member of the central Board of
Military Education had been recommended by the Commissioners of 1856, on
the ground of the close connection between military and civil
educational questions. The decision to carry out this recommendation,
simultaneously with an augmentation in the strength of the Council,
appears to have been connected with the determination arrived at, to
place the superintendence of the Academy at Woolwich&mdash;the
competitive examinations for admission to which had hitherto been
conducted by Canon Moseley&mdash;in the hands of the Council.
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page539" id = "page539">539</a></span>
They were formally appointed Visitors of the Academy in August, 1858,
their control over the education of the officers of the army being now
made almost entirely general. The powers of the Council, however, in
regard to Woolwich appear, probably from the fact of their not being
defined by Royal Warrant, to be theoretically somewhat less extensive
than those possessed by them over Sandhurst, as the recommendation of
the appointment of professors, which in the case of the latter college
is formally vested in the Council, is at the Academy left to the
Lieutenant-Governor.</p>

<p>In October, 1859, the Indian Military College at Addiscombe was
placed under the supervision of the Council, and the examinations for
admission to it were conducted by them until the close of the
establishment in 1861.</p>

<p>In 1860, the superintendence of army schools, garrison libraries,
recreation rooms, the Royal Military Asylum at Chelsea, and the Royal
Hibernian School at Dublin, were transferred from the Secretary of State
for War to the Council.</p>

<p>In 1864, the Advanced Class of Artillery Officers, on its
institution, was placed under the control of the Council. Since this
date the whole system of army education has been superintended by that
body, with the exception of the examinations of officers for promotion,
the School of Musketry at Hythe, and the more peculiarly regimental
institutions which exist in the Department of Artillery Studies, the
School of Gunnery at Shoeburyness, and the School of Military
Engineering at Chatham, for the special instruction of officers of the
scientific corps. The Survey Class at Aldershot, though not formally is
indirectly subject to their supervision.</p>

EXAMINATIONS FOR DIRECT COMMISSIONS.</a></p>

<p class = "smallhead">HISTORICAL NOTICE.</p>

<p><span class = "firstword">Previously</span> to the year 1849, no
educational qualifications were required as a condition of obtaining a
commission, except from officers appointed to the scientific
corps&mdash;admission to which could only be obtained by passing through
the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich&mdash;and from the small
proportion of officers, scarcely amounting, at that time, to one sixth
of the whole number annually obtaining commissions, who entered the
other branches of the service from the Royal Military College at
Sandhurst. Examinations for admission to the army generally were first
instituted by the Duke of Wellington, when Commander-in-Chief, in 1849.
The examination, in addition to general subjects of elementary
education, included the professional subject of fortification, in which
the candidate was required to have read some easy work on the subject,
and to have received some instruction in drawing. This requirement was
subsequently somewhat modified; and the knowledge of fortification
afterward exacted from a candidate was, “to be able to trace upon paper,
in presence of the examiners, a front of fortification according to
Vauban’s first system, and also the profile of a rampart and parapet.”
In other subjects, modifications were also introduced; but the general
character of the examinations remained much the same as originally
established, and the regulations introduced by the Duke of Wellington,
in 1849, continued substantially in force, until the general revision of
the system of military education, which took place in 1857. It appears,
however, from the evidence given by Lord Panmure, before the Royal
Commission on the Purchase System, that, during the Crimean war, the
stringency of the examinations was very much relaxed.</p>

<p>The examinations were held at Sandhurst by the professors of the
College, in the presence of the Lieutenant-Governor, and were conducted
to a great extent <i>vivâ voce</i>. The Select Committee of the House of
Commons on Sandhurst (1855) did not make any recommendation in regard to
these examinations,
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page542" id = "page542">542</a></span>
but stated in their report that in the only branch of the examination
which was of a military character, namely, fortification, the knowledge
required would easily be mastered in a week. The character of the
examination, however, appears to have been very generally regarded with
dissatisfaction. Mr. Sidney Herbert, when Secretary at War, in 1854,
criticised it severely, as being “too technical, too limited, and within
its limits too severe,” and as leading necessarily to a candidate
cramming up a few books which happened to be in use at Sandhurst,
without affording any test of general education. He contemplated at that
time a revision of the examinations, and the institution of a special
board of examiners, in place of the Sandhurst professors, for the
purpose of conducting them; and the Treasury, in connection with this
subject, suggested that the machinery proposed for the object in view
should be combined, as far as practicable, with that about to be
established for examining candidates for the Civil Service.</p>

<p>The outbreak of the Crimean war prevented Mr. Sidney Herbert’s
proposals, which were connected with a general plan for the instruction
of officers, from being carried into effect; and in 1856, Lord Panmure,
before the Purchase System Commission, spoke of the defects of the
existing examinations in nearly the same terms as those used by Mr.
Herbert in 1854. After stating that they led to a system of cramming up
particular books, he laid down the principle that the examination
“should be such as young men may be supposed capable of passing without
having any particular professional education. It ought to be upon
general subjects, such as a young man ought to become acquainted with
during his passage through any high educational establishment in this
country.”</p>

<p>The various schemes for the reorganization of military education
brought under the notice of Lord Panmure, at the end of 1856, proposed
improvements in the system of examinations for admission to the army;
and nearly all the authorities consulted on the subject at that time
appear to have concurred in the opinion that the examinations should be
strictly non-professional, and should be confined to requiring proof on
the part of the candidates of a knowledge of the ordinary subjects of
liberal education. The commissioners appointed in the same year to
consider the training of officers for the scientific corps also
recommended that the examination of candidates
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page543" id = "page543">543</a></span>
for commissions, who did not pass through a military college, should be
of a general, and not of a special, character.</p>

<p>The Council of Military Education, on their appointment, in April,
1857, were instructed “to revise the whole system of examination for
direct appointments to the army,” which is at present very defective;
and this subject was, in fact, the first of those referred to in their
instructions which they were directed to take into consideration. After
consultation with the head masters of some of the chief public schools
of the country, with the view of ascertaining the amount of knowledge
which might fairly be expected from young men of 17, the Council
proposed a scheme of examination based on the fundamental principle that
the examination should be entirely non-professional, and confined to
subjects which form the course of ordinary liberal education at civil
schools. Regulations founded upon the proposal of the Council were
issued on the 1st of August, 1857, and it was announced that they would
come into operation at the beginning of 1858. These regulations were
subsequently modified in some of their details, even before the first
examination was held under the new system; further modifications have
been from time to time introduced in them, without, however, affecting
their general character; and the scheme proposed by the Council of 1857
has, in its main principles, formed the basis of all the regulations
under which examinations for direct commissions have been held to the
present time.</p>

<p>It appears, however, from the evidence given before the Commission of
1869, that it has been found necessary, from time to time, to diminish
the difficulty of the examinations, owing to the number of failures
among the candidates, and that the present standard is considerably
lower than that originally established. An acquaintance with French,
English history and geography, and drawing, was at first an
indispensable condition of qualification, but is now no longer required;
the obligatory subjects of examination have thus been reduced from five
to two&mdash;mathematics and English&mdash;while, at the same time, the
amount of mathematical knowledge formerly exacted has been reduced.</p>

<p>The first examination under the new system took place in February,
1858. Even before this, at the end of 1857, the place of examination had
been transferred from Sandhurst to
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page544" id = "page544">544</a></span>
London, and the method of conducting the examinations by printed papers,
instead of by <i>vivâ voce</i>, had been adopted. The examinations have,
ever since that period, been conducted by examiners appointed by the
Council of Military Education, and have, as a rule, been held half
yearly. By a regulation which has been for some years in force,
candidates for direct commissions are also permitted to be examined at
foreign stations. The examination is, in this case, conducted in the
presence of a board appointed by the officer commanding the station; but
the method of examination is, in all other respects, identical with that
adopted at home. The examination papers are forwarded by, and the
candidates’ replies are returned to, the Council of Military
Education.</p>

<p>The plan proposed by the Council was intended to regulate admission
to the army in ordinary times of peace; but almost immediately after it
had been formally approved, and before it had actually come into
operation, the pressure occasioned by the outbreak of the Indian Mutiny
led to an abnormal condition of circumstances. In September, 1857, a
circular was issued, announcing that commissions would be given without
examination on the condition of the applicant raising a certain number
of recruits. In March, however, of the following year, this temporary
measure was abolished, the pressure for troops being no longer such as
to render its continuance necessary. Since that period no candidates,
with the exception of graduates of the universities, have obtained
commissions without passing the regular examination.</p>

<p>Before 1862, candidates were eligible for commissions without
purchase, on passing the examination for direct appointments. Since that
year, however, all free commissions have been reserved for cadets at
Sandhurst, and those who pass the direct examination have only obtained
commissions by purchase.</p>

<p>V. Of the foregoing subjects, the elementary branches of mathematics
and the English language, to the extent stated in the following
paragraphs, will be considered obligatory:</p>

<p>1. In mathematics, 1,200 marks will be given to the following
obligatory portions, viz., arithmetic, including vulgar and decimal
fractions, proportion, extraction of the square root, and simple
interest.</p>

<p>Algebra, including fractions, simple equations, and questions
producing them: Euclid, the first three books.</p>

<p>Of the 1,200 marks allotted to the foregoing portions of mathematics,
400 will be required for qualification, and of these at least 200 must
be obtained in arithmetic.</p>

<p>2. In the English language, the candidate will be required to write
correctly and in a good legible hand from dictation, and to compose
grammatically. He will be required to obtain at least 200 marks in this
subject.</p>

<p>3. Out of the remaining subjects the candidate may select any
three.</p>

<p>4. No candidate will be allowed to count the marks gained in any one
of the three voluntary subjects, unless amounting to one-sixth of the
whole number of marks allotted to that subject; and for qualification,
he will be required to obtain on his five subjects a total of 1,500
marks.</p>

<p>5. In the examination in classics, passages will be given for
translation from the books usually read at schools; grammatical
questions will be set, and English passages also given for translation
into the Latin and Greek languages.</p>

<p>VI. The result of each examination will be reported to the
Commander-in-Chief, and the names of any candidates who distinguish
themselves will be specially brought to his notice.</p>

<p>VII. An unsuccessful candidate will not be debarred from applying to
the Commander-in-Chief for permission to attend a future examination. No

gained by a candidate on former occasions.</p>

<p>In the event of a candidate not appearing for examination at the time
appointed, such candidate will not be permitted to attend on the next
occasion, and he will render himself liable to have his name either
erased entirely or placed at the bottom of the list of those noted for

PUBLIC SCHOOL EDUCATION AS PREPARATORY TO MILITARY EXAMINATIONS.</a></p>

<p class = "smallhead">A.&mdash;GENERAL NOTICE.</p>

<p>In connection with the Modern Departments, at some public schools,
technical instruction in military subjects is actually at present given.
This, for instance, is the case at Cheltenham College, the Modern
Department at which appears, in fact, to have been originally instituted
with the express object of affording means of special military
education, and at the present day is officially called the “Military and
Civil Department.” At one time, also, even at some schools in which
Modern Departments did not exist, classes were formed in which
instruction in military subjects was given to boys intended for the
army. Both at Eton and at Harrow such classes existed, and fortification
and military drawing were taught in them. The object of the formation of
these classes appears in both cases to have been to enable boys to go up
straight from school to the examinations for admission to the army,
without the necessity of having recourse to private tuition. At the time
of their institution a knowledge of fortification was required in the
examination for direct commissions, and a candidate was therefore unable
to present himself for this examination without some special
preparation. At the commencement of 1858, however, the direct commission
examinations were entirely remodelled; the small amount of fortification
previously required was at that time excluded from the subjects of
examination, which have ever since been of a non-professional character,
and more or less such as enter into the course of ordinary liberal
education. With the exclusion of technical subjects from the military
examinations, the necessity for any special instruction in such subjects
in
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page547" id = "page547">547</a></span>
candidates for admission to the army ceased. The military class at
Harrow seems to have died out within a few years of its establishment;
it has not been in existence during the last ten years and more. At
Eton, though the corresponding class is still maintained, the teaching
of technical military subjects in it has been abandoned. Even in the
Modern Department at Cheltenham the instruction appears of late years to
have become of a less decidedly military character than it originally
was; and fortification, which was at one time taught at Wellington
College, no longer enters into the course of instruction there. In the
Modern Side, which has within the present year been established at
Harrow, though partially intended, among other purposes, to assist the
education of boys intended for the army, no attempt is made to give
special military instruction.</p>

<p>The question of the possibility of affording an adequate military
education at civil schools was fully discussed by the Commissioners
appointed in 1856 to consider the training of officers for the
scientific corps.</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>Having arrived at the conclusion that professional military education
as hitherto given in this country has been begun at too early an age, we
are met by what may be called the extreme opposite view, which would
suggest the desirableness of giving up altogether education in military
colleges previously to entering the army, or to entering a purely
practical class or college for the special corps of Artillery and
Engineers. An opinion appears to exist that the ordinary schools of the
country are the best means of giving nearly the whole teaching of
general and even military science which is desirable for all classes of
officers before entering the army. It seems to be thought that not only
modern languages and mathematics, but military history and topography
are likely to be taught in such schools sufficiently for the highest
military purposes, and that even young men intended for the special arms
of the service may, on joining a military academy, be absolved, or
almost entirely absolved, from any other studies than those included
under the expression “<i>a purely practical course</i>.”</p>
</div>

<p>The Commissioners expressed their unhesitating dissent from this
view. After pointing out the difficulties of giving at ordinary schools
a complete preparation even in studies of a general preparatory
character, such as modern languages and mathematics, and the still
greater difficulties of teaching special subjects, like military history
and topography, the Report proceeds:</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>Agreeing, therefore, as to the fact of a “sound general education
being given by public schools,” we are unable to draw from it the
conclusion that they will “give a specific military education.” They may
indeed assist our military education, in a manner which the true sense
of the term “sound general education” expresses, by encouraging
preliminary tastes and studies, such as general history, mathematics,
and modern languages, English included, to a greater extent than they do
at present. But if there is such a thing as a science of war at all, it
stands to reason that it can only be taught fully in cases where young
officers have the passion and the capacity to begin it early, by its own
teachers, and in its own place. The teachers should be
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page548" id = "page548">548</a></span>
practical men, as well as men of military science; the place a military
college. And the great schools of the country will perform the same
service to such an academy for young scientific officers as they do for
places which give a specific education for other professions; they will
<i>prepare for it</i>, but disclaim any attempt to <i>complete
it</i>.</p>
</div>

<p>The Report of the Public Schools Commission does not appear to have
made any direct reference to the question of the possibility of giving
technical military instruction at civil schools; but the disinclination
shown by the Commissioners to recommend even the general institution of
“Modern Departments” would lead to the conclusion that they were not
disposed to view with favor the introduction of any system of special
instruction into the ordinary school course.</p>

<p>The question has been dealt with at considerable length in the
evidence taken before the present Commission. In addition to the
evidence given by Dr. Barry, Mr. Southwood, Dr. Benson, and Dr. Temple,
to which particular reference is made in the Report, opinions on the
subject were expressed by several military witnesses. Major-General Sir
P. Herbert considers that all which is learnt at Sandhurst&mdash;all the
knowledge requisite for a line officer&mdash;might equally well be
acquired at a public school, if proper arrangements were made for
teaching it. In his opinion fortification (including the practical
construction of field-works), military drawing and surveying, military
history and drill, could all be taught by military instructors at public
schools without difficulty, and without interference with the subjects
of general education. Major-General White considers that military
history, modern languages, and drawing might be taught with advantage at
public schools to boys intended for the army, although it would be
difficult to teach the practical work of field fortification, artillery,
and surveying. Colonel Baker appears to be of opinion that at the
Universities, certainly, a special preliminary education might be given
to candidates for the army, on a system similar to that which it was at
one time proposed to introduce at Cambridge, but which does not appear
to have ever been actually adopted. At the same time, though this
instruction would be of a special character, Colonel Baker does not seem
to contemplate its embracing strictly technical military subjects. On
the other hand, His Royal Highness the Duke of Cambridge is of opinion
that special military classes at public schools would fail;
Major-General Sir F.
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page549" id = "page549">549</a></span>
Abbott thinks it unnecessary to establish such classes; Colonel Hort is
decidedly opposed to an attempt to give military instruction at any but
a military college, on the ground that it could not be so effectively
given at a civil establishment, and would, moreover, interfere with the
acquisition of a general education; and Lieut.-General Sir D. Cameron
considers that it would be impossible for public schools to give a
thorough or perfect knowledge of the practical subjects taught at
Sandhurst, such as fortification, artillery, military drawing, and
surveying.</p>

<p>In connection with the same subject suggestions have been made by
some witnesses that the Government should assign a certain number of
free commissions annually, as prizes to be competed for, either at
particular public schools, or more generally amongst candidates educated
at such schools. The institution of military exhibitions or scholarships
at civil schools, and of military degrees at the Universities, has been
also suggested. By some witnesses these proposals are advocated with the
special view of inducing public schools to adopt a system of military
instruction; by others with the more general object of holding out
increased encouragement to enter the service to candidates who have had
the advantage of a public school education.</p>

<p>Although the question of giving military instruction at public
schools was not specially discussed by the Public School Commissioners,
their attention was directed to the results of public school education
in preparing candidates for the military examinations. Their Report
speaks as follows in reference to this subject:</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>The number of public-school boys who enter the army is not large. Of
1,976 candidates for direct commissions within three years, 122 only had
been at any of these schools. Of these 102 succeeded and 20 failed. It
will be observed, on reference to the returns, that this proportion of
failures is considerably below the average; the public school men,
therefore, were better prepared than the general run of candidates. Of
96 who passed at their first examination, 38 came immediately from
school, 58 had had intermediate tuition. Of the 20 who failed, 14 had
had such tuition.</p>

<p>The public-school candidates for Sandhurst during the same period
were 23 out of 375; the proportion who succeeded being here also above
the average. Of 18 who succeeded, 11 came straight from school; of five
who failed, only one.</p>

<p>The scheme of examinations for direct commissions, framed to meet the
suggestions of the Head Masters of public schools, is simple and easy,
and requires nothing that is beyond the reach of any boy of moderate
industry and ordinary capacity; and it is clear that no boy, who will
give himself a little trouble, needs to forego the wholesome influences
of a great school for the sake of being “crammed” in the house of a
tutor. The Sandhurst examination is also evidently within the reach of
the schools.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page550" id = "page550">550</a></span>
<p>The qualifying examination for Woolwich appears, before 1862, to have
required an amount of mathematical knowledge difficult of attainment for
a boy educated at a public school; but it underwent in that year some
changes which have made it easier for candidates who have not received a
special training. The obligatory mathematics do not now go beyond plane
trigonometry; and a candidate need not obtain in them, to qualify, more
than 700 marks out of 3,500; with this minimum, and with a fair
proficiency in Latin, Greek, French, and geometrical drawing, he is
entitled to enter into the competition. This standard is certainly not
so high as to be inaccessible to a boy educated at a good public school,
and from a table showing the working of the scheme at the examination of
January, 1863, it appears that of the 20 successful competitors, 11
distinguished themselves in classics; the other marks were chiefly
gained in mathematics and French. In three years, previous to this
change, 35 public-school candidates passed and 49 failed to pass the
qualifying examination, the totals being 545 and 689. Of the whole 84,
two only went direct from the schools, and these failed.</p>

<p>In another passage the Commissioners say: “The main studies of the
public schools being classical, it is obvious that, unless a due amount
of weight is given to the classics in the Woolwich examinations, boys
from those schools will not stand a fair chance in the competition. On
the other hand, as it is of importance that the examinations should
comprise other subjects besides classics, it is also obvious that unless
the public schools provide a due amount of instruction in those other
subjects, the candidates whom they send up must compete at a
disadvantage. It is certain that there has hitherto been a want of
adjustment between the Woolwich standard and the teaching of the public
schools. The fault, we think, lies chiefly, though not wholly, in the
deficiencies in the course of education pursued at the latter; and we
are convinced that when these deficiencies have been supplied the
difficulty which is now complained of will speedily disappear. But it is
also to be observed, with respect to the Woolwich examinations
themselves, that the scale of marks has lately (as&nbsp;we have already
stated) undergone an alteration, which diminishes the amount of
mathematical attainment required, and allows greater weight to classical
scholarship. It appears probable that the Modern Departments at
Cheltenham and Marlborough would not have been what they are had the old
Woolwich standard, which is stated to have influenced them so strongly,
been the same as the present; and probable, also, that they will
hereafter feel the effects of the change which has been made in <ins

EXAMINATIONS FOR PROMOTIONS.</a></p>

<p class = "smallhead">HISTORICAL NOTICE.</p>

<p><span class = "firstword">Examinations</span> for promotion were for
the first time instituted shortly after the introduction of examinations
for admission to the army, by the Duke of Wellington when
Commander-in-Chief, in the year 1850. A&nbsp;circular memorandum,
published on the 14th of May of that year, announced that all officers
would in future be subjected to an examination previously to promotion
to the respective ranks of lieutenant and captain. The first examination
was to be confined to subjects connected with the rudiments of drill,
regimental duties, interior economy, and the Mutiny Act and Articles of
War. The second examination for the rank of captain was in addition to
extend to more general subjects, and to include geography, ancient and
modern history, mathematics, and field and permanent fortification; but
the examination in these subjects was not intended to affect lieutenants
who had entered the service previously to 1849.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page551" id = "page551">551</a></span>
<p>The examination for promotion to the rank of lieutenant was to be
conducted regimentally by the commanding officer and the two next senior
officers of the candidate’s regiment. The purely professional portion of
the second examination, for the rank of captain, was to be conducted in
the same manner; with regard to the mode of testing the candidates’
qualifications in the more general subjects required in this
examination, it was stated that such orders would be given in each
individual case as the Commander-in-Chief might think proper and
necessary.</p>

<p>These regulations continued in force up to the time of the
institution of the Council of Military Education in 1857, although it
appears, both from official statements made by the Secretary at War, and
from numerous expressions of opinion in Parliament between the years
1854 and 1857, that, at least so far as regarded the second examination
for the rank of captain, little attempt was made, even nominally, to
enforce the regulations. Mr. Sidney Herbert proposed, in 1854, in
connection with his general scheme of military education, to remodel the
examinations and to institute a special machinery for conducting them;
and though no actual steps were taken to carry out his proposal, the
necessity of making the examinations real and genuine tests of
professional knowledge, and of enforcing strict qualifications for
promotion, was frequently recognized in the numerous discussions which
took place in Parliament on the subject of military education during the
course of the Crimean War.</p>

<p>The Council of Military Education, on their appointment in 1857, were
directed to consider the question of the professional examination of
officers for promotion up to the rank of captain, and in the course of
the year submitted a proposal on this subject, in connection with a
scheme for providing instruction for officers after entering the
service.</p>

<p>New regulations on the subject were issued on the 19th of July, 1858,
which, while introducing little change in regard to the examination of
cornets and ensigns, rendered a knowledge of mathematics, history, and
fortification no longer requisite in the second examination for the rank
of captain. Geography, on the other hand, was still retained among the
subjects, and, as a condition of promotion to a captaincy, a lieutenant
was required “to be able to state the general divisions
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page552" id = "page552">552</a></span>
of the world, the name of the capital of each nation in Europe, and the
principal rivers, seaports, and military posts in Great Britain,
Ireland, and Her Majesty’s Dominions in every part of the world.” The
examinations of cornets and ensigns still continued to be conducted
regimentally; that of lieutenants, so far as related to matters of
regimental economy, detail, or discipline, was to be made by boards of
officers appointed by the commanding officer at the station, consisting,
when possible, of three senior officers not of the same corps as the
candidate.</p>

<p>In November, 1858, revised regulations were issued, which, in
accordance with the recommendations of the Council of Military
Education, made considerable changes in the examinations, and placed
them on their present basis. The subjects of regimental and ordinary
duties on which candidates were to be examined were more minutely
detailed than heretofore; the examinations were made entirely
professional, geography being excluded from the second examination, and
at the same time it was announced that lieutenants would be required to
show a sufficient knowledge of reconnaissance and of field
fortification. But the most important change made at this time was in
regard to the mode of conducting the examinations, which were no longer
to be carried on regimentally, but by a board appointed by the
commanding officer of the district, consisting (if&nbsp;possible) of
three field officers,&mdash;with the additional provision that in no
case in which it could possibly be avoided, an officer of the same
regiment as the candidate was to be a member of the board. Cornets and
ensigns were to be required to pass the examination before completing
eight months’ service; and, in order to give additional stringency to
the regulations, it was announced that the Commander-in-Chief would “not
hesitate to promote (either regimentally or from other corps) officers
who may have passed the required examination, in place of the idle and
incompetent.”</p>


<p class = "smallhead">REGULATIONS IN FORCE IN 1869.</p>

<p class = "heading"><i>Infantry and Cavalry.</i></p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>159. Before officers are recommended for promotion to the rank of
lieutenant, the commanding officer is to apply to the senior officer of
the district or station for a board to examine and report upon their
qualifications as under:</p>

<div class = "inlist">
<p>(<i>a.</i>) They must have a thorough knowledge, and must give an
account, of the duties they have to perform as regimental orderly
officers, as officers commanding guards, or as subaltern officers of
guards under officers of superior rank.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page553" id = "page553">553</a></span>
<p>(<i>b.</i>) They must have a thorough knowledge of, and be able to
put a company through the various exercises and evolutions prescribed in
the first two parts of the “Field Exercises of the Infantry;” and they
must be acquainted with the rifle drill and practice, and the
theoretical principles of musketry, as defined in the authorized book of
instruction.</p>

<p>(<i>c.</i>) They must know exactly the place of all the company
officers in every situation of the battalion, and be able to command a
company in battalion exercise.</p>

<p>(<i>d.</i>) They must be acquainted with such parts of the Queen’s
Regulations and Orders for the Army as relate to the duties, and conduct
of a subaltern officer, and with the Mutiny Act and Articles of War, so
far as is necessary for the performance of their duties as members of a
court-martial.</p>

<p>(<i>e.</i>) They must be acquainted with the regulations of the army
in regard to the pay and messing of the troops, the supply of clothing
and necessaries, and all details regarding the weight of, and mode of
carrying, the various articles of the soldier’s kit, arms,
accoutrements, and ammunition.</p>
</div>

<p>160. In addition to such portions of the foregoing as may apply to
the cavalry service, it is necessary in the case of cornets recommended
for promotion to the rank of lieutenant,&mdash;</p>

<div class = "inlist">
<p>(<i>a.</i>) That they shall have learnt their foot drill and sword
exercise, and have been instructed in the single and double ride.</p>

<p>(<i>b.</i>) That they shall be able to put a troop through the
carbine, lance, and sword exercise, and to exercise both a squad and
troop in the drill and evolutions prescribed in the Cavalry Exercise
Book.</p>

<p>(<i>c.</i>) That they shall be able to command a troop in squadron
exercise.</p>

<p>(<i>d.</i>) That they shall have made themselves masters of the
detail of saddlery, the mode of fitting the saddle, bridle, etc., and of
the whole equipment of the cavalry soldier and his horse.</p>
</div>

<p>161. Lieutenants in the Cavalry and Infantry will, in addition to the
foregoing, before they are recommended for promotion to the rank of
captain, be required to show that they are further duly qualified as
follows:</p>

<div class = "inlist">
<p>(<i>a.</i>) They must have a thorough knowledge of the provisions of
the Mutiny Act and Articles of War, and of the forms and proceedings of
courts-martial, and must give evidence of having studied some of the
standard works on military law.</p>

<p>(<i>b.</i>) They must understand perfectly the evolutions of a
regiment of cavalry or a battalion of infantry, as laid down in the
regulations for those services respectively.</p>

<p>(<i>c.</i>) They must be acquainted with the light infantry drill,
duties of outposts, patrols, escorts, advanced and rear guards.</p>

<p>(<i>d.</i>) They must perfectly understand the interior economy of a
troop or company, and the established system of keeping their
accounts.</p>

<p>(<i>e.</i>) They must be thoroughly acquainted with the Queen’s and
War Office Regulations applicable to their own branch of the
service.</p>

<p>(<i>f.</i>) They must be competent to take charge of a troop,
company, or detachment, in every position in which it may be placed.</p>

<p>(<i>g.</i>) And they will be required to show that they have a
sufficient knowledge of field fortification and reconnaissance.</p>
</div>

<p>162. The board of examination is to consist, if possible, of three
field officers; but on no occasion, when it can be avoided, is any
officer of the same regiment as the candidate to be a member. In all
cases the board will ascertain by practical examination, as well as by
verbal and written answers to questions, whether the officer is
instructed in the subjects specified in the preceding paragraphs. The
questions are to be written on half margin, and the replies written
opposite to them. The board will mark in red ink its correction of any
mistakes in the answers, and will certify in each case that “the
candidate has not received any assistance from books or other sources.”
The report of the board to be on a separate sheet, and when officers of
different regiments are examined by the same board, the report in
connection with each regiment is to be made separately.</p>

<p>163. The general officer commanding will forward the report of the
board, and the written questions and replies, to the adjutant-general,
accompanied by his own observations thereon, regarding the nature of the
examination, the correctness of the answers, and the eligibility of the
officer examined.</p>

<p>164. Every cornet or ensign is to be examined on the different points
herein specified, before he has completed one year’s service; and should
he fail to qualify himself for promotion within that period, his
commanding officer must report, through the general officer commanding,
for the information of the Commander-in-Chief, whether it is owing to a
want of diligence and attention on the part of the officer, or to
sickness, or other circumstances over which he could have had no
control.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page554" id = "page554">554</a></span>
<p>165. No officer will be recommended for promotion to the rank either
of lieutenant or captain unless his examination papers and certificate
of qualification have been received by the Military Secretary; but the
Commander-in-Chief will, in all cases, select the senior officer who may
have qualified for promotion to the higher grade.</p>


<p class = "heading"><i>Artillery.</i></p>

<p>166. The examination of lieutenants of artillery for the rank of
captain will include all the subjects required from officers of the line
of corresponding rank, except that a general knowledge only of the
evolutions of cavalry and infantry will suffice. In addition to the
foregoing, lieutenants of artillery are to be examined as to their
acquaintance with the more special duties of their arm of the service.
The following will serve as a guide:</p>

<div class = "inlist">
<p>(<i>a.</i>) Field-gun drill. Exercise of heavy guns on ground and
traversing platforms, mortar drill, rocket drill, Armstrong gun drill,
practice with hot shot and molten iron shells, gun and transporting
carriage drill.</p>

<p>(<i>b.</i>) General duties of the men, and principles involved in
mounting and dismounting ordnance generally, in placing guns on towers,
in embarking and disembarking ordnance, and in moving ordnance up steep
inclines; also the tackle, etc., required in the above operations.</p>

<p>(<i>c.</i>) Different pieces of ordnance in use throughout the
service at the time of examination, their weight and calibre, and
special purpose.</p>

<p>(<i>d.</i>) Ammunition employed with ordnance generally; ammunition
employed with Armstrong guns; general construction of a Congreve rocket,
and the principle of its motion; manufacture and action of fuzes and
tubes; the advantages of the rifle action, and the principle upon which
it depends; essential points with regard to rifling ordnance: general
principles of breaching; position and employment of artillery in the
field; considerations which regulate the rapidity of artillery fire;
principles connected with the construction of artillery carriages;
general knowledge of laboratory duties.</p>

<p>(<i>e.</i>) Embarking and disembarking horses; management of horses
on board ship.</p>

<p>(<i>f.</i>) To be able to define technical artillery terms, etc., in
such a way as to make them understood by the non-commissioned officers
and men under their command, such as,&mdash;1, point blank; 2, point
blank range; 3, dispart; 4, chambers; 5, preponderance; 6, different
kinds of artillery fire; 7, how elevation gives an increase of range; 8,
windage; 9, deviation, etc., etc.</p>

<p>(<i>g.</i>) Subalterns who have been one year or more in the horse
brigade, or in a field battery, will be required, in addition to the
foregoing subjects, to be thoroughly acquainted with stable duties, and
horse artillery or field battery movements and details. All must have a
general knowledge of these subjects.</p>
</div>

<p>167. Every officer, on becoming the thirtieth on the list of
lieutenants, must be prepared to undergo the required examination. Any
officer, after four years’ service, may apply for such examination at an
earlier period.</p>

<p>168. Instructions will, from time to time, be issued to the general
or other officer commanding districts or stations, to assemble a board,
to consist of three officers, viz., a field officer (of&nbsp;the
artillery, if possible), an officer of the staff, and a captain of
artillery, or an officer of that corps who may already have passed the
examination. Either the gunnery instructor or the fire-master should,
when practicable, be selected for this duty. If it be impossible to
obtain a staff officer, a captain of the line should be substituted; if
a second officer of artillery cannot be had, an officer of engineers
should be substituted; but either the president or one member must be of
the artillery.</p>

<p>169. That portion of the examination which can be best replied to in
writing will be conducted by means of questions prepared by the deputy
adjutant-general of artillery, and forwarded to the general officer
commanding the district. The <i>vivâ voce</i> and practical examination
will be conducted by the board of officers, who will satisfy themselves
that the officer under examination not only possesses the requisite
knowledge himself, but that he is able to impart that knowledge in a
clear and satisfactory manner.</p>

<p>170. The board will then forward, through the general officer, its
report, together with the written answers, to the adjutant-general of
the forces; and, in returning to him the written answers, the president
of the board will certify that they are the <i>bonâ fide</i>
performances of the candidates, without assistance. The written papers
will then be examined by the deputy adjutant-general of artillery, and
the result, together with the opinion of the board, reported to the
Commander-in-Chief.</p>

<p class = "smallhead">ROYAL WARRANT OF OCTOBER 30, 1871.</p>

<p>In pursuance of the abolition of the whole system of purchase, sale,
or exchange for money, of commissions in the army, by Royal Warrant,
dated July 20, 1871, certain changes in respect to first appointments,
regimental promotion, and exchanges, became necessary, and were provided
for in the Royal Warrant issued October 30, 1871, which became operative
on the first day of November following. By these regulations, the first
step in official rank is that of Sub-Lieutenant; the rank of Cornet and
Ensign being no longer recognized. As a general rule, the final
appointments will be given only to successful candidates at a
competitive examination. These will be probationary, and revocable in
case the unfitness of the incumbents shall be demonstrated by practical
trial in their <ins class = "correction" title = ". missing">work.</ins>
From the Memorandum of the Secretary of War (Edward Cardwell), which
accompanies the Warrant, we cite the following as defining the present
system of original appointments and <ins class = "correction"
title = ". missing">promotion.</ins></p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>Commissions as Lieutenants will be given to all Cornets and Ensigns
appointed before the 26th of August, 1871, and to Cornets and Ensigns
appointed since that date from the A List at Sandhurst, their
commissions to date from the first of November.</p>

<p>Commissions as Sub-Lieutenants will be given to:</p>

<p>(<i>a.</i>) All other Cornets and Ensigns appointed after the 26th of
August, 1871, the rank of Cornet and Ensign being abolished.</p>

<p>(<i>b.</i>) Candidates who have passed the examination for Direct
Commissions, in their turn as vacancies occur.</p>

<p>(<i>c.</i>) Candidates for commissions in the Household Cavalry and
Foot Guards who are nominated to fill the vacancies which occur in those
regiments, before the date of the first competitive examination for
Sub-Lieutenancies, and who pass a qualifying examination.</p>

<p>(<i>d.</i>) Candidates from the Universities now on the
Commander-in-Chief’s list.</p>

<p>Sub-Lieutenants will be attached for a year to regiments at home.
They will then be required to go through a course of instruction, and on
passing a practical professional examination, be commissioned to
regiments as Lieutenants. They will be under strict discipline, and will
be liable to be removed for unfitness, either moral or physical, and for
misconduct. Those unsuited to the Cavalry may be transferred to the
Infantry.</p>

<p>In dating their commissions they will be allowed a portion, not
exceeding one year, of their services as Sub-Lieutenants; the time
allowed being determined by the class of certificate they receive after
their year’s regimental training, their conduct while under instruction,
and their position at the final examination. Their service for
retirement will reckon from the date of their commissions as
Lieutenants.</p>

<p>Candidates who have passed the examination for direct commissions,
and have also passed satisfactorily through a year’s course of study at
the Royal Military College before being appointed to be Sub-Lieutenants,
and Sandhurst Cadets from the B List will be commissioned to regiments
as Lieutenants on serving satisfactorily for twelve months with a
regiment as Sub-Lieutenants.</p>

<p>There are now a large number of supernumerary officers, and also a
large number of candidates who have passed for commissions.</p>

<p>The absorption of supernumerary officers will probably be completed,
and the candidates who have passed for commissions have received their
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page556" id = "page556">556</a></span>
appointments in about two years from the present time, and personal
appointments in the Army will then only be given as follows:</p>

<p>(<i>a.</i>) To successful candidates at a competitive
examination.</p>

<p>(<i>b.</i>) To non-commissioned officers recommended for promotion by
the Field-Marshal Commanding-in-Chief.</p>

<p>(<i>c.</i>) To candidates from the Universities.</p>

<p>(<i>d.</i>) To Queen’s Cadets, Indian Cadets, and Pages of Honor.</p>

<p>(<i>e.</i>) To Lieutenants of Militia.</p>

<p>The competitive examination will be carried out by the Civil Service
Commissioners; the standard of qualification being that recommended by
the Royal Commission on Military Education. Ample notice will be given
of the first examination, and there will be no advantage in any
applications being made for admission to be examined before the
publication of such notice.</p>

<p>Non-commissioned officers, on being selected for promotion, will pass
an examination in certain professional subjects; and then, after twelve
months’ satisfactory service as Sub-Lieutenants, will receive
commissions as Lieutenants.</p>

<p>A certain number of Sub-Lieutenancies a year will be allotted to
candidates who have passed the University examination specified in the
Regulations. If they also pass the examination for the degree of B.A.,
they will be allowed two years’ extension of the limit of age.
University candidates will be required to give at least six months’
notice of their desire to be admitted into the Army. If in any year
there should be more candidates than appointments, the requisite number
will be chosen by competition between the candidates; after their
appointment they will go through the same course as other
Sub-Lieutenants.</p>

<p>There will be no vacancies for two years for any candidates from the
Universities whose names are not now on the Commander-in-Chief’s
list.</p>

<p>Queen’s and Indian Cadets and Queen’s Pages will be required to pass
a qualifying examination, which for the present will be the same as that
recommended by the Royal Commission on Military Education. The
nominations will remain as heretofore. When appointed, Cadets and Pages
will go through the same course as other Sub-Lieutenants.</p>

<p>First appointments as Subalterns in the Militia will be made on the
recommendation of the Lieutenants of counties. Candidates, before
receiving their Commissions as Lieutenants in the Militia, will be
required to pass a qualifying examination in general subjects equal to
the standard fixed as necessary for a candidate for a Sub-Lieutenancy.
They will next be required to be attached to a regiment of the Line for
three months, or such time as may be necessary to teach them their
drill. After serving with their Militia regiments for two annual
trainings, they will be eligible for the appointment of Lieutenants in
the Army. In order to obtain such an appointment they must be
recommended by the commanding officer of their Militia regiment, his
recommendation being confirmed by the general officer commanding the

professional subjects of the same kind as that which will be required of
a Sub-Lieutenant before he receives his commission as Lieutenant.</p>

<p>The limits of age, except for non-commissioned officers, will be
fixed at from seventeen to twenty for Sub-Lieutenants, the limit being
raised to twenty-two in the case of candidates who have passed their
examination for the degree of B.A. at the Universities, and from
nineteen to twenty-two for Lieutenants from the Militia.</p>

<p>In addition to the examinations hitherto required from regimental
officers, those who are promoted to the rank of Captain after the 1st of
November will, before being promoted to the rank of Major, be required,
to pass a professional examination.</p>

<p>The General Order promulgating the Royal Warrant and the Memorandum
of Secretary Caldwell contains the following paragraph:</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>His Royal Highness the Field-Marshal Commanding-in-Chief, in
promulgating these regulations to the Army, would desire to impress upon
each individual officer, and especially upon those of junior standing
who have still a name to make in the service, that they must more than
ever rely upon their own exertions, upon their professional knowledge
and ability, upon their general character and conduct as officers, and
the opinion with which they impress their military superiors, for
advancement in the service.</p>

<p>In the evidence before the Military Education Committee, of July 13,
1869, the Secretary of the Civil Service Commission expressed the
opinion that the entrance examination, both to Sandhurst and Woolwich,
on subjects purely civil, might be conducted by the latter; and that the
same and other subjects, in their scientific value, both in all
qualifying and competitive examinations for direct commission and
promotion, could be conducted by the same examiners, thereby securing
economy, more uniformity in the methods and tests, and more satisfactory
results. The staff of examiners should be composed of changing as well
as of permanent members, and when the service is professional, an expert
should be called in. The entire work of the Civil Service Commission,
including the India Service, is done by one Commissioner, the Secretary,
and his permanent examiners, with occasional assistants.</p>

<p><span class = "firstword">The Royal Military College at
Sandhurst</span> was instituted in 1799, on the persistent
representations of its necessity and advantages, by General Le Marchant,
an eminent and distinguished officer, who met his death in actual
service on the plains of Salamanca, in 1812. The report of the
Parliamentary Commissioners of 1855 and 1870 give the following
particulars of the history and present condition:</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>It commenced as a place of instruction for officers, in 1799. In
1801, the Junior Department was organized. The united departments took
the name of the Royal Military College, and his Majesty George the Third
was pleased by Royal Warrant to appoint a Supreme Board of Commissioners
for the purpose of managing all the affairs of the College.</p>

<p>An establishment and a course of study were recommended by this
Board, and adopted in a Royal Warrant, passed in the same year, 1801.
From this date warrants were issued from time to time until the warrant
of 1808, which cancels all former warrants, and still regulates the
College.</p>

<p>By this warrant, a Board of Commissioners was appointed, consisting
of the Commander-in-Chief, the Secretary at War, the Master-General of
the Ordnance, the Quartermaster-General, the Adjutant-General, the
Governor, and the Deputy-Governor of the College,&mdash;all for the time
being. Certain other officers were added to these <i>ex officio</i>
members. In the Board so constituted were vested the control, direction,
and management of all the affairs of the College. The College was to be
under the immediate command of the Governor and Deputy-Governor, to be
divided into a senior and junior department, each to have its own course
of study, under its own staff.</p>

<p>A collegiate board was created to take cognizance, of all matters
relating to the interior economy of both departments. This board
consisted of the Governor, the Deputy-Governor, and three other resident
military authorities.</p>
</div>

<p>The Royal Warrant of the 27th May, 1808, for regulating all matters
relative to the Royal Military College, states the objects of the two
departments of the College, as follows:</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>The Senior Department of the Royal Military College is established
for the purpose of instructing officers in the scientific parts of their
profession, with a view of enabling them the better to discharge their
duty when acting in command of regiments (the situation in which they
can best recommend themselves to Us, and be entitled to hope for
advancement in the higher stations of Our service), and, at the same
time, of qualifying them for being employed in the
Quartermaster-General’s and Adjutant-General’s Departments.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page560" id = "page560">560</a></span>
<p>The Junior Department of the Royal Military College is appropriated
to the instruction of those who, from early life, are intended for the
military profession, and who, by this means, may be grounded in science
previously to their obtaining commissions in Our army.</p>

<p>This department of the College is also intended to afford a provision
for the sons of meritorious officers, who have fallen or been disabled
in the service of their country, and the means of education to the sons
of those officers who belong to Our regular service.</p>
</div>

<p>The first of the departments organized was thus the Senior
Department, which was established at High Wycombe, in 1799, although it
would seem that classes for the military instruction of officers had
been in existence previous to that year. The origin of the Senior
Department is thus described in the evidence given by Sir Howard Douglas
before the Select Committee on Sandhurst:</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>General Jarry, who was the first Commandant of the Senior Department,
was a Frenchman, highly educated in France, who entered the service of
Prussia a short time before the commencement of the Seven Years’ War,
and was on the personal staff of Frederic the Second through the whole
of that war. He returned to France, and became afterward one of the
generals of the French army; and, in the year 1795, defected from the
French army, and came to London, where he soon became very generally
known as a man of eminent talent, perfectly master of the science and
the practice of his profession, and, from his having served so long
about the person and on the staff of Frederic the Second, full of the
most interesting anecdotes and instructive details connected with that
war. General Le Marchant, having formed an acquaintance with General
Jarry, in London, it occurred to him that, if General Jarry could be
engaged to give lectures to a certain number of young officers Who might
be disposed to go and reside where the general might attend, it would be
very advantageous to the service. General Jarry was so engaged.
A&nbsp;house was taken at High Wycombe; a considerable number of the
rising young officers of the day became his students,&mdash;Sir George
Murray, Sir Henry Bunbury, Sir Richard Bourke, General Richardson, and a
great many others. General Jarry soon found that the rudiments of
military science in the British army were not sufficiently known to
enable all the students to profit by his instruction, and recommended
that mathematical, and fortification, and other classes, should be
established; and, accordingly, Mr. Dalby, a mathematical professor, M.
St. Denis, professor of fortification, and M. Polchet, of the
Polytechnic School, were engaged; and in this Way the Senior Department
was established.</p>
</div>

<p>General Jarry became commandant of the establishment on its
institution, and, in 1804, Sir Howard Douglas himself was appointed to
assist General Jarry, as superintendent.</p>

<p>The formation of the Junior Department had probably been determined
upon from the time when the Senior Department was established. It was
actually organized in 1801, when it was established at Great Marlow,
and, in the year 1803, consisted of 200 cadets; the Senior Department
being, at the
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page561" id = "page561">561</a></span>
same time, composed of 30 students. Each department had at this time its
own commandant, superintendent, and special staff of instructors
(7&nbsp;for the Senior, and 19 for the Junior Department); while there
was, in addition, a general staff, consisting of a governor,
lieutenant-governor, and other officials, for the two departments,
which, although in separate localities, together constituted the Royal
Military College.</p>

<p>The Royal Warrant of 27th May, 1808, fixed the establishment on a
still larger scale, as follows:</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>1 Governor, 1 Lieutenant-Governor, 1 Inspector-General of
Instruction.</p>

<p><i>Senior Department.</i>&mdash;1 Commandant, 1 Adjutant, 30
Students.</p>

<p><i>Junior Department.</i>&mdash;1 Commandant, 1 Major, 4 Captains of
Companies, 412 Gentlemen Cadets.</p>

<p><i>Staff.</i>&mdash;1 Chaplain and Librarian and Superintendent of
Religious and Classical Instruction, 1 Agent, 1 Secretary to the Board
of Commissioners, 1 Paymaster, 1 Quartermaster, 1 Surgeon, 1 Assistant
Surgeon.</p>
</div>

<p>The number of professors is not fixed by the warrant, but, in 1810, 5
were employed at the Senior, and 32 at the Junior Department. In 1815,
the number of professors was 6 at the former, and 36 at the latter.</p>

<p>The establishment, with slight modifications, continued as above
throughout the period of the war which terminated in 1815; but shortly
after the conclusion of peace reductions began, in consequence of the
recommendations made in the report of the Finance Committee of 1817, and
at the same time the course of instruction in the Junior Department was
made of a much less military character than it had originally been.</p>

<p>The Senior Department was, as has been stated, originally established
at High Wycombe, and the Junior Department, as there was not sufficient
accommodation for it at the same place, was, on its institution, placed
at Great Marlow. It is probable, however, that it was intended from the
first that the Military College should be at Sandhurst, and it appears
that, as early as 1801, the greater part of the estate at Sandhurst had
been purchased. Owing, however, to doubts having subsequently arisen as
to the eligibility of Sandhurst as a site for the college, the works
there do not appear to have been commenced until 1809; and it was
eventually determined that the Junior Department alone should be placed
there, the Senior Department being accommodated at Farnham. In 1812, the
Senior Department went to the quarters prepared for them at
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page562" id = "page562">562</a></span>
the latter place, and about the same time the Junior Department was
removed to Sandhurst. In 1820, in consequence of the space left vacant
by the reductions which had then been made in the Junior Department, the
Senior Department was transferred to Sandhurst; its separate military
staff was at the same time abolished, the number of students at it was
reduced to 15, and the number of instructors to 2.&nbsp;It continued in
this state down to the time of its conversion into the Staff College,
which took place in January, 1858. The Junior Department was also, by
successive reductions, brought, in 1832, to the state in which it stood
in 1855, at the time of the appointment of the Select Committee of the
House of Commons, the number of cadets having been reduced to 180,
divided into two companies. In the year 1832, also, the Parliamentary
votes in aid of the College, which, in 1815, had amounted, for the
Junior Department alone, to £34,000, entirely ceased, and, from this
time up to 1855, the College was not only self-supporting, but, in some
years, actually paid money into the Exchequer.</p>

<p>In the year 1855, in consequence of attention having frequently been
drawn in Parliament to the state of Sandhurst, a Select Committee of the
House of Commons was appointed to inquire into the condition of the
Royal Military College. The establishment of the College, was, at that
time, as follows:</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>1 Governor, 1 Lieutenant-Governor.</p>

<p><i>Senior Department.</i>&mdash;2 Instructors, 15 Students.</p>

<p><i>Junior Department.</i>&mdash;1 Major and Superintendent of
Studies, 2 Captains of Companies, 180 Gentlemen Cadets, 1 Chaplain, 1
Secretary to the Board of Commissioners, 1 Paymaster and Quartermaster,
1 Surgeon, 1 Assistant Surgeon, 1 Riding Master, 16 Instructors.</p>
</div>

<p>This continued without material alteration to be the establishment
until 1858.</p>

<p>The instructors undertook the following branches:</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>(<i>A.</i>) <i>Senior Department.</i>&mdash;1. Mathematics and
Fortification. 1.&nbsp;Military Surveying.</p>

<p>(<i>B.</i>) <i>Junior Department.</i>&mdash;3. Mathematics.
2.&nbsp;Fortification. 3.&nbsp;Military Drawing and Surveying.
1.&nbsp;Landscape Drawing. 2.&nbsp;History, Geography, and Latin.
3.&nbsp;French, 2.&nbsp;German. [The seniors in those branches also gave
instruction to the Senior Department.]</p>
</div>

<p>The Chaplain also gave instruction in History.</p>

<p>The title of Major and Superintendent of Studies dates from the year
1842. For some years previously, the offices of Adjutant,
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page563" id = "page563">563</a></span>
Paymaster, and Superintendent of Studies, had been combined in the
person of one officer, Major Proctor. On his retirement, in 1842,
Lieut.-Colonel Prosser was appointed Major and Superintendent of
Studies&mdash;an office which has been retained to the present
day&mdash;and the appointment of Adjutant was abolished.</p>

<p>At the time of the inquiry by the Select Committee of the House of
Commons (1855), the Junior Department of the College was a school for
boys. The limits of age for admission were from 13 to
15.&nbsp;Candidates were admitted by application to the Governor, on
passing a qualifying examination, before the professors of the college,
in elementary subjects of ordinary education. The maximum term of
residence was four years, the average period being three years. The
course of study was intended to complete the general education of the
youth, in addition to giving him military instruction, and included
history, geography, and Latin, as well as more professional
subjects.</p>

<p>The system of instruction which prevailed at the College at that time
is described as follows by Mr. Twisden, now professor of mathematics at
the Staff College:</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>The instruction and examinations in the Junior Department were, in
the year 1855, conducted on the following system: There was a division
of the department into upper and lower school; but, practically, the
division was of little importance. The most important division was made
by the line which, in each separate branch of instruction, divided the
cadets in the Board class from those not in the Board class.</p>

<p>A cadet was in a Board class who was actually preparing for the
public examination, which took place before the “<i>Board</i> of
Commissioners for Regulating the Affairs of the Institution.” The Board
was, however, in most cases, represented by not more than one or two of
its members. In any given subject, a cadet had to pass through certain
grades of elementary instruction before he could be placed in a Board
class. Moreover, he was only moved from one grade of elementary
instruction to another on passing examinations, which were held monthly
by the senior instructors in the several subjects. The junior
instructors reported those of their cadets whom they regarded as ready
for promotion, and the senior ascertained that the proper degree of
proficiency was obtained. Thus, in mathematics, a cadet had to pass
examinations in Fractions and Decimals, mixed numbers, Rule of Three,
Interest, and Square Root, Algebra up to the end of Quadratic Equations,
and logarithms,&mdash;four successive examinations in all. He had then
to spend a half year in the study of Euclid’s Geometry before admission
to the Board class. It will be understood that all the cadets were not
examined monthly, but only such as were reported as fit for examination;
so that any one cadet might pass a long time without examination, or he
might be examined for several successive grades in one subject, and not
undergo any examination in another. There was, in fact,
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page564" id = "page564">564</a></span>
scarcely any mutual dependence of one branch of instruction upon
another. I believe the only exceptions to this were, that a cadet was
required to have passed his examination in algebra before getting into
the lowest fortification class, and to have gained a certain proficiency
in military drawing before getting into the surveying class.</p>

<p>The Board class in each branch was taught by the senior instructor in
that branch, except that the Board class of history was taught by the
chaplain. When a cadet had passed an examination in any subject before
the Board, he was said to have taken up a step. The steps which it was
possible for him to take up were as follows, and I have arranged them in
three groups, for conveniences of reference:</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>A.&mdash;(1.) Euclid’s Geometry. (2.) Fortification. (3.)
Surveying.</p>

<p>B.&mdash;(4.) Trigonometry and Mensuration. (5.) Attack and Defence
of Fortification. (6.) History and Geography. (7.) Latin. (8.) French.
(9.) German.</p>

<p>C.&mdash;(10.) Elements of Mechanics. (11.) Elements of Coördinate
Geometry and Differential Calculus.</p>
</div>

<p>To gain a commission without purchase, it was necessary to take up
the three steps in the group A, and any three in the group B,&mdash;six
in all. But if a cadet took up more than six steps, the fact was
mentioned in the certificate given him on leaving the College. For
gaining this honorary distinction, the steps marked in group C were
allowed to count; but I believe not otherwise. I&nbsp;may mention that,
in many cases, more than six steps were taken up.</p>

<p>The process of examination before the Board was this: About seven
weeks before the end of the half year, the senior instructor in each
branch reported the cadets in his branch whom he thought capable of
taking a step. Thus the senior instructor or professor of mathematics
reported those cadets in the Euclid Board class whom he judged capable
of taking up the step. Shortly after, these cadets were examined before
the Lieutenant-Governor; about a week before the end of the half year,
they were examined again, on this occasion, before the Governor; lastly,
they were examined publicly before the <i>Board</i>. Failure was
possible in either of these examinations, and not unfrequently occurred
at the preliminary examinations, and sometimes, though rarely, at the
Board examination. The effect of failure was, that the cadet could not
pass his step without going through his examinations at the end of the
next half year.</p>

<p>The examinations were conducted entirely <i>vivâ voce</i>. The
Governor’s and Lieutenant-Governor’s examinations were searching; they
sometimes lasted from six to seven hours; but, of course, the cadets,
severally, were under examination only during a part of that time. The
Board examination, though less searching, was a real examination.
A&nbsp;cadet under examination had not the least notion of what was
going to be asked, except that it was fairly within the subject of the
step.</p>

<p>The system thus briefly described was invented by Major Proctor, who
was at first <i>Adjutant</i> and, afterward, Superintendent of Studies.
It was in operation, at all events, as early as the year 1818. It was
open to several objections; but it possessed this capital advantage,
that it was calculated to bring, and, in point of fact, brought a large
majority of the cadets up to a certain moderately high standard of
proficiency. The instructors were under no temptation to take great
pains with a few clever boys, and to neglect the rest; they were nearly
sure to assist every cadet showing the least inclination to work, and to
assist those most who were in need of assistance.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the system failed to supply a cadet of superior
ability with a motive to attain a high degree of proficiency in any
given subject. The
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page565" id = "page565">565</a></span>
utmost attained was, that cadets of more than ordinary ability were
encouraged to attain the standard of proficiency in more than the
necessary six subjects. The system was also open to the serious
objection that, under it, the cleverest cadets got through their course
quickly. This was bad for them, for it had the effect of bringing their
school-education to an early end; and it was bad for the institution,
because the eldest cadets were not the most intelligent.</p>

<p>I must be allowed to add, that my experience of the examinations by
<i>vivâ voce</i> has given me a very lively sense of the value of that
kind of examination; and, though it is not adapted for all subjects,
and, where many have to be examined, takes too much time, yet it might
be used under many circumstances with very great advantage, and I regard
its total disuse since the year 1858 as a very serious error.</p>

<p>I have mentioned above the fact of the Junior Department being
divided into an under and upper school. I&nbsp;may add that there were
six classes,&mdash;three in each school, and two removes in each class.
I&nbsp;believe that this was the remains of an earlier organization,
which, without being formally abrogated, was, by degrees, nearly
obliterated by the introduction of the step system. The only thing that
kept up the distinction between upper and lower school was, that a
cadet, to be in a Board class, had to pass into upper school. The three
classes in the upper school did not have a nominal existence in
1851.</p>

<p>With respect to the Senior Department, a somewhat different system
was followed. The course was one of two years; but, in the case of
officers who had been cadets, the course was one of a year and a half.
There was an examination held at the end of each half year on the
subject of the half year’s course. The method of examination resembled
that in use in the Junior Department. The subjects comprised in the
course are mentioned in a paper printed on page 215 of the evidence
taken before the Select Committee of the House of Commons on Sandhurst
(1855).</p>

<p>In certain respects, officers might do more than the prescribed
course, and obtain honorary mention, <i>e.g.</i>, they might do extra
plans; they might take up a certain amount of analytical mathematics,
with a portion of Poisson’s “Traité de Mécanique,” and of Laplace’s
“Mécanique Céleste.” I&nbsp;have by me the synopsis of the ordinary
course of mathematics in use before the year 1858; but, as the heads of
it are given in the paper above referred to, it is unnecessary to give
any details about it.</p>
</div>

<p>The Report of the Select Committee of 1855 contained various
suggestions for the improvement of both departments of the College, but
did not propose to alter the character of the Junior Department as a
place of juvenile education. The only practical results of the report
were, the establishment of Queen’s cadetships, and the revision of the
rates of payment required from all classes of cadets. The institution of
Queen’s cadetships was determined upon by the Government in 1856, but
the other alteration was not immediately carried out, and no
modification of importance in the constitution of the College ensued
from the recommendations of the Committee. It was not until the general
reorganization of the system of military education which took place in
1857 that any important change was made in regard to the Military
College.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page566" id = "page566">566</a></span>
<p>It appears to have been decided at the end of 1856 by Lord Panmure,
then Secretary of State for War, that an amalgamation of the Junior
Department of Sandhurst with the lower classes of Woolwich should be
effected. The Council of Military Education, on their appointment, in
April, 1857, were directed to suggest the mode in which this
amalgamation could be carried out, taking, as their starting point, the
principle that Sandhurst was to be converted from a school for boys into
a college for young men, with the age of admission ranging from 16 to
18.</p>

<p>The proposed plan having been approved, an announcement was made, in
December, 1857, that the education of candidates for all arms of the
service, who did not obtain commissions by direct appointments, would be
given at Sandhurst; that entrance would be obtained by competitive
examination, open to candidates between the ages of 16 and 18; that the
period of study would be two years, and would be terminated by a
competitive examination, the most successful candidates in which would
be permitted to select the Engineers or Artillery, according to the
number of vacancies in those corps, or would receive commissions without
purchase in the Cavalry, Guards, or Line. Those who selected the
Ordnance corps were to be removed to the school of application at
Woolwich.</p>

<p>Almost simultaneously with this notification, appeared a General
Order, announcing the conversion of the Senior Department into the Staff
College, which was then placed under a separate commandant and staff of
instructors,&mdash;the Junior Department being henceforward called the
Cadet College.</p>

<p>An examination for admission to Sandhurst, under the regulations
described above, took place in January, 1858, when 24 candidates were
admitted to the College. On the 26th of April, however, a resolution was
passed by the House of Commons, on the motion of Mr. Monsell, in
consequence of which the plan for the amalgamation of Woolwich and
Sandhurst was necessarily abandoned; and, in May, 1858, revised
regulations were issued, which again placed Sandhurst on the footing of
an entirely distinct establishment from Woolwich. In these regulations,
however, a new provision was introduced, by which a cadet at the
Military College was, if otherwise eligible, permitted to compete at the
examination for admission to Woolwich, without his position at Sandhurst
being affected by failure in this examination. This regulation has been
retained.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page567" id = "page567">567</a></span>
<p>The large increase in the numbers of the College which was
contemplated by the amalgamation scheme was not carried out, the
establishment still remaining at 180 cadets, divided into two companies.
At the same time, the other alterations recommended by the Council in
the constitution and course of study of the College were brought into
effect. Since this period the system of juvenile military instruction,
which had been already abandoned at Woolwich, has been discontinued at
Sandhurst. The establishment was converted from a school for boys into a
college for young men, the minimum age for admission being placed at 16;
while the course of instruction&mdash;the length of which was fixed at
two years&mdash;was made almost entirely professional. The principle of
competition was adopted as the condition of admission, although not to
so full an extent as at Woolwich, the candidate for Sandhurst being
required to apply to the Commander-in-Chief, in order to have his name
entered on the list of competitors. The entrance examinations for
admission to the College, and the final examinations for commissions,
were placed under the control of the Council of Military Education; and
the whole method of instruction was revised, the old system of “steps”
being abandoned.</p>

<p>For many years, up to this time, the College had been almost entirely
self-supporting. The orphan-class of cadets, established by the Royal
Warrant of 1808, who had received a gratuitous education, had, after
successive reductions, been finally abolished in 1822; and, though the
sons of officers were still educated at reduced rates, the system had
been gradually introduced of affording them this advantage without
expense to the public, by increasing the rates paid by the sons of
private gentlemen. This system, which had been animadverted on by the
Select Committee of the House of Commons, in 1855, was altered on the
reorganization of the College, in 1858; the rates of payment from all
classes were reduced, and the principle was, at least partially,
adopted, of defraying, by a Parliamentary vote, the difference between
the actual cost of the education of a cadet and the lower rates charged
for the sons of officers. The first public announcement of the
institution of Queen’s cadetships, the holders of which were to receive
a gratuitous education, was also made in 1858. Since this period, a
large part of the expense of the College has been borne by the
public.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page568" id = "page568">568</a></span>
<p>Some addition to the instructional staff was made in the year 1858,
in consequence of the general changes introduced at that time in the
system and subjects of instruction; and, in the same year, the office of
Adjutant&mdash;which had been abolished in the year 1842&mdash;was
revived, in consequence of the strong representations of the Governor,
Lt.-Gen. Sir H.&nbsp;D. Jones.</p>

<p>The next important change in the organization of the College was in
1862. After the abandonment of the scheme for the amalgamation of
Woolwich and Sandhurst, the Council of Military Education turned their
attention to the subject of enlarging the latter establishment, with the
view of making it a general military college, through which all
candidates for commissions in any branch of the service, except the
Artillery and Engineers, should be required to pass. The general outline
of a scheme having this object in view was submitted by the Council as
early as July, 1858, to General Peel, then Secretary of State for War.
It was still under consideration when General Peel left office, in the
summer of 1859, and was again brought under the notice of his successor,
Lord Herbert, in August of that year.</p>

<p>After some consideration, the general principle of the scheme was
sanctioned by Lord Herbert, in December, 1859; but no immediate steps
were taken for carrying the plan into operation. At the end of 1860,
however, the Council were directed to draw up a detailed scheme of
organization for the College, on the assumption that all candidates for
commissions in the Cavalry, Guards, and Infantry, would be required to
pass through a year’s course of instruction there; a vote was also
included in the estimates of 1861 for commencing the enlargement of the
buildings, with the ultimate object of providing accommodation for 600
cadets. The details of the scheme were, after some correspondence, fully
matured, and were on the point of being submitted to Her Majesty for
approval, with the view of the new system coming into effect on the 1st
of January, 1862. The plan, however, met with very great opposition,
both in the House of Commons and from the authorities of the
universities, who regarded it as necessarily leading to the exclusion of
university men from the army. In consequence of this opposition, the
Under-Secretary of State for War, toward the end of the session of 1861,
announced, in the House of Commons, that the new system should not come
into
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page569" id = "page569">569</a></span>
operation until Parliament had had a further opportunity of expressing
their opinion upon it. The original plan was also so far modified that
the extension of the College was limited to providing accommodation
first for 500, and then for 400 cadets, in the first instance; but the
abolition of appointments to direct commissions, and the system of
passing all candidates for commissions in the Line through the College,
were still contemplated, though the commencement of the system was
deferred until the 1st July, 1862.</p>

<p>The question was in this state at the time of the death of Lord
Herbert, in August, 1861. Sir George Lewis, who succeeded him as
Secretary of State for War, having, during the recess, reconsidered the
question, announced, shortly after the commencement of the session of
1862, that it had been determined to abandon the idea of requiring all
candidates for commissions in the Line to pass through the College, and
that the system of appointments to direct commissions by purchase would
be maintained. At the same time, it was proposed that
<i>non-purchase</i> commissions should in future only be obtained by
passing through Sandhurst, and that an enlargement of the College to 336
cadets should take place, to provide for the increased number of
non-purchase commissions caused by the amalgamation of the Indian with
the Imperial Army.</p>

<p>Even in this modified form, the plan for the extension of the College
appears to have been viewed with considerable jealousy by the House of
Commons. A&nbsp;vote adverse to it was actually at first carried; but
the question having, in consequence of the representations of Sir George
Lewis, been reconsidered, the plan proposed by the Government was at
length agreed to. Regulations for the College on the new footing were
issued on the 1st May, 1862. These regulations form the basis of the
present system of the College.</p>

<p>One of the most important changes made at this time was the great
increase in the number of free commissions placed at the disposal of the
College. Under the old system which existed prior to 1858, while the
institution was still a mere place of juvenile education, all cadets who
passed in the six “steps,” to which allusion has been made, received
free commissions; but there was, strictly speaking, no competition for
such commissions. After the alteration in the age of admission to the
College, and the general revision of the course of
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page570" id = "page570">570</a></span>
instruction which took place in 1858, a limited number of free
commissions were bestowed upon those cadets who stood highest in the
final examination. A&nbsp;large number of these appointments, however,
still remained in the gift of the Commander-in-Chief, and were granted
to candidates who passed the ordinary examination for direct
commissions. Since 1862, all non-purchase commissions have been reserved
for cadets at the Royal Military College, with the exception of a small
number (not exceeding on an average 12 annually) bestowed upon
non-commissioned officers promoted from the ranks, and upon gentlemen
who have held the appointment of page to Her Majesty. The commissions
given to the latter are exclusively in the Foot Guards, and their number
seldom exceeds one in each year. The free commissions allotted to the
College are thrown open to competition among the cadets, with the
exception of those reserved for Queen’s and Indian cadets. Both of these
classes of cadets have, since the institution of Indian cadetships,
which took place simultaneously with the change of the College system,
in August, 1862, been entitled to receive free commissions on passing a
qualifying examination at the end of their term of residence.</p>

<p>The course of study at the College was, at the same time,
considerably modified, with the view of allowing its completion, under
ordinary circumstances, in one year, instead of two years, as
formerly,&mdash;the maximum term of residence being fixed at a year and
a half. An attempt was also made to render the course more strictly
professional, and better adapted to qualify a young officer for the
performance of ordinary regimental duties immediately on joining his
corps, by the introduction of instruction in military law, interior
economy, etc.</p>

<p>The age of admission was fixed at 16 to 20 for candidates for the
Infantry, and 16 to 22 for those for the Cavalry,&mdash;an extension of
a year in these limits being for the first time introduced in favor of
students at the universities. A&nbsp;further privilege held out to the
latter class of candidates was that, while others could only obtain
admission by competitive examination, the fact of having passed certain
university examinations was of itself made a qualification for
admission. These concessions, which, at first, were made to the
Universities of Oxford, Cambridge, and Dublin, have been since extended
to the other universities.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page571" id = "page571">571</a></span>
<p>The number of cadets was never raised to the extent contemplated in
the plan proposed by Sir George Lewis. It was originally intended that
the College should accommodate 336 cadets, divided into four companies
of 84 each; but the establishment was ultimately fixed at 250. This
increase, however (the numbers having, previously to 1862, been 180),
led to the addition, in August, 1862, of a third company to the two in
which the cadets had been previously divided. An additional captain was
appointed to command this company, and, at the same time, three
subaltern officers (one to each company) were, for the first time, added
to the strength of the establishment, to assist the captains in the
charge of the companies. Simultaneously with this, an important
alteration was made in the discipline of the College, by abolishing the
system which had hitherto prevailed of employing the sergeants to assist
in maintaining discipline by reporting the cadets for offences committed
against the regulations.</p>

<p>The increase in the establishment also necessitated in this year an
augmentation of the staff of instructors.</p>

<p>The establishment of the Royal Military College in 1863, after the
change of system had come into effect, was as follows:</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p><i>General Staff.</i>&mdash;1 Governor, 1 Chaplain, 1 Paymaster, 1
Quartermaster, 1 Surgeon, 1 Assistant-Surgeon, 1 Riding Master.</p>

<p><i>Staff College.</i>&mdash;1 Commandant, 1 Adjutant, 9 Professors,
30 Students.</p>

<p><i>Cadet College.</i>&mdash;1 Lieutenant-Governor, 1 Major and
Superintendent of Studies, 3 Captains of Companies, 3 Subalterns, 250
Gentlemen Cadets, 1 Adjutant, 40 Professors and Instructors, of whom two
were employed also at the Staff College.</p>
</div>

<p>The organization of the College has undergone no material alteration
since 1863, with the exception of the abolition of the office of
Lieutenant-Governor, and the substitution for it of that of Commandant
of the Cadet College. The change, though decided upon in 1862, was not
carried out during the tenure of office of the officer who, at that
time, held the appointment of Lieutenant-Governor, and did not actually
take effect until 1864. The Lieutenant-Governor, though nominally the
deputy of the Governor, had exercised no control over the Commandant of
the Staff College from the time of the institution of the latter
establishment, in 1858. His functions were limited to the Cadet College,
of which he was virtually, though not nominally, the Commandant.</p>

<p>The establishment of cadets was raised in 1865 to 300, and
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page572" id = "page572">572</a></span>
some slight alterations have, at various times, been made in the number
of professors and instructors; but, in its general character, the
establishment at the present time remains as it was in 1863.</p>

<p>The modifications which have since been made consist chiefly in the
reduction of the higher limit of age for admission to 19 for all
branches of the service (retaining, however, the former exception in
favor of students from the universities); the discontinuance of the
study of military law, etc.; and the extension of the ordinary course of
residence from one year to a year and a half.</p>

<p>In regard to discipline, the system of assigning marks for good
conduct, which was introduced by the regulations of 1862, has been
discontinued, owing to practical difficulties which were found to occur
in carrying out the system with uniformity. At the beginning of 1868, an
alteration was introduced in the powers of the professorial staff with
regard to the maintenance of discipline. Previously to this period they
had exercised no disciplinary powers; they have since been required to
take notice of all offences which come within their cognizance, either
in or out of study, and have been empowered to place a cadet in arrest
pending an inquiry into the offence. Even at the present time, however,
the professors have no power of punishment, this power being confined to
the military staff of the College.</p>

<p>According to the Royal Warrant of 1808, the four companies of cadets
were placed upon the establishment of the army, and every one admitted
to the College received a warrant of gentleman cadet, with the daily pay
of 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> Down to the year 1857, the regulations for
admission to the College contained the provision that, “in conformity to
the Royal Warrant, dated the 27th of May, 1808, all gentlemen cadets at
the Royal Military College are subject to the Articles of War.” This
provision appears to have been omitted from all regulations published on
the recommendation of the Council of Military Education since the
reorganization of the College, which took place at the beginning of
1858. At the present time, a cadet, on admission, is required to sign a
declaration “to conform, in every respect, to Her Majesty’s Regulations,
and to the rules and discipline of the service.”</p>

<p>The Board of Commissioners, at the time of the report of
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page573" id = "page573">573</a></span>
the Select Committee of the House of Commons, in 1855, still continued
to administer all the affairs of the Royal Military College, in virtue
of the wide powers vested in them by the Royal Warrant of 1808. For some
years previously to this, however, the War Office had exercised
considerable control over the financial acts of the Board. On the
appointment of the Council of Military Education, in 1857, the latter
body began to superintend the course of instruction at the College,
their attention having been directed to this subject in the first
instructions issued to them on their appointment. At the beginning of
1858, they commenced to conduct the examinations for admission, and, by
a Royal Warrant of the 1st October, 1858, they were formally appointed
Visitors of the College, and required to report to the
Commander-in-Chief upon the instruction given at it. The power of
recommending either the appointment or removal of the professors and
instructors was, by the same warrant, placed in their hands.</p>

<p>The original warrant of 1808 has never been cancelled, and the powers
vested by it in the Board of Commissioners still, therefore, nominally
remain in force, except so far as by the warrant of 1858. Since this
time, however, the connection of the Commissioners with the management
of the College has been gradually diminished. In 1863, the office of
Secretary to the Board was abolished, his financial duties being
transferred to the Paymaster of the College, and the performance of his
other duties being provided for in the Commander-in-Chief’s office. The
discipline of the College still remains nominally under the
superintendence of the Commissioners; but, even in regard to this point,
their interference, except when questions of considerable importance
have arisen, appears to have been little called for. Their duties of
late years seem to have been principally confined to business connected
with the management of the College property, in regard to which,
although the estate is now formally vested in the Secretary of State for
War, the former powers of the Commissioners are reserved.</p>

<p>The attendance in the College, since its reorganization, has been as

<h5><a name = "britain_sandhurst_queens" id = "britain_sandhurst_queens"
href = "#britain_sandhurst">QUEEN’S AND INDIAN CADETSHIPS.</a></h5>

<p>The creation of Queen’s cadetships originated in the recommendations
of the select Committee of the House of Commons on Sandhurst. At the
time the Committee reported (in&nbsp;the year 1855) the age of admission
to Sandhurst was from 13 to 15; in the following year, however, at the
time the recommendations of the Committee were adopted by the
Government, it was in contemplation to raise the minimum age for
admission to the College to 16; and it was consequently decided that, in
order to meet the case of those who under the former regulations would
have been admitted as Queen’s cadets at a younger age, a special
allowance of 40<i>l.</i> a year might, at the discretion of the
Secretary of State, be granted to a candidate qualified for a Queen’s
cadetship, at the age of 13, to assist him in his preparatory education,
until he attained the age at which he would be eligible for admission to
the College. This arrangement was sanctioned by the Treasury in 1856,
and at first the results of the recommendations of the Select Committee
seem to have been confined to granting candidates the special allowance
in aid of their preparatory education, as no cadet entered until
1860.</p>

<p>The first public announcement of the institution of Queen’s
cadetships, and of the regulations under which they were to be granted,
was made by a General Order, dated Horse Guards, 5th January, 1858. It
had by this time been finally determined to fix the ordinary minimum age
for admission to Sandhurst at 16; but an exception was made in favor of
the Queen’s cadets, who were to be admitted one year younger,&mdash;at
the age of 15.&nbsp;The following were among the regulations:</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>These cadetships, of which there are twenty in all, are confined to
the sons of officers of the army, Royal navy, and Royal marines, who
have fallen in action, or have died of wounds received in action, or of
diseases contracted on active service, and who have left their families
in reduced circumstances.</p>

<p>Gentlemen cadets on this class are educated gratuitously.</p>

<p>The nominations, with the concurrence of the Secretary of State for
War, are made by the Commander-in-Chief for the army, in the proportion
of 15 cadetships, and by the First Lord of the Admiralty for the navy
and marines, in that of five cadetships,&mdash;to whom applications are
to be made.</p>

<p>No candidate can be admitted under the age of 15, nor above that of
17.</p>

<p>In a case where the services of the father and the circumstances of
the family are deemed such as to constitute a claim, a candidate
ineligible for immediate admission, on account of his not having
attained the proper age, but being a promising youth, may, at the
discretion of the Secretary of State for War, be allowed an addition to
the compassionate allowance, with the especial view of promoting his
education, until he is eligible for admission.</p>
</div>

<p>The regulations under which Queen’s cadets are at present nominated
are similar to the above, with the exception that
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page576" id = "page576">576</a></span>
the wording of the phrase “diseases contracted on <i>active service</i>”
has been altered to “diseases contracted on <i>service abroad</i>,” and
that Queen’s cadets, like other candidates, are not now admitted until
the age of 16.&nbsp;An addition to the “Compassionate Allowance,” not
exceeding 40<i>l.</i> a year, may at the same time be granted to a
candidate after the age of 13, in order to assist him in his education
until he becomes eligible for admission to the College. The number of
Queen’s cadetships (20) includes both those who have entered, and those
to whom the educational allowance is granted previously to their
admission.</p>

<p>From the first institution of Queen’s cadetships, the candidates
nominated to them have been admitted to the College on passing a
qualifying examination, and have received a gratuitous education; they
were, however, originally required to compete for commissions without
purchase, with other candidates, at the end of the College course. The
privilege of obtaining a free commission on passing merely a qualifying
examination was not extended to them until the institution of the Indian
cadetships in 1862. As it was found necessary to exempt the Indian
cadets from competition with other candidates for commissions without
purchase, a similar privilege was extended to the Queen’s cadets. Both
classes of cadets, in addition to their free education and maintenance,
receive clothing and pocket money.</p>

<p>The institution of Indian cadetships at Sandhurst took place in
consequence of the transfer of the government of India from the East
India Company to the Crown, and the subsequent amalgamation of the
Indian and Imperial forces.</p>

<p>The notice of the admission of Indian cadets to the establishment
appears for the first time in the College regulations of 1st May, 1862.
Their number, like that of the Queen’s cadets, is limited to
20.&nbsp;They are nominated, under the provisions of Acts 21 &amp; 22
Vict. cap. 106, s. 35, and 23 &amp; 24 Vict. cap. 100, by the Secretary
of State for India in Council, from the sons “of persons who have served
in India in the military or civil services of Her Majesty or the East
India Company.” The restrictions, however, regarding the death of the
father and the circumstances of the family, which apply to a candidate
for a Queen’s cadetship, do not limit the nomination of Indian cadets.
The expense of the education and maintenance of the latter is borne by
Indian revenues.</p>

FOR ADMISSION, CLOTHING, BOOKS, PAYMENTS, ETC., 1867.</a></h5>

<p>1. Candidates for vacancies at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst,
will be required to undergo an examination under the superintendence of
the Council of Military Education. Examinations for this purpose will be
held in June and December of each year, at the Royal Hospital,
Chelsea.</p>

<p>2. Twenty Queen’s cadets will be borne on the establishment, being
the sons of officers who have fallen in action, or have died of wounds
received in action, or of diseases contracted on service abroad; and who
have left their families in reduced circumstances. Fifteen will be sons
of officers of the army, and five will be sons of officers of the Royal
Navy and Royal Marines.</p>

<p>There will be, in addition, twenty Indian cadetships, for nomination
to which the sons of persons will be selected who have served in India
in the military or civil services of Her Majesty, or of the East India
Company.</p>

<p>3. Candidates, whether for the infantry or the cavalry, must be
between 16 and 19 years of age at the commencement of the term
immediately succeeding their admission examination.</p>

<p>Terms commence on the 1st February and 1st August.</p>

<p>Students from the Universities will be admissible at the ages stated
in Art. 11 of these regulations.</p>

<p>4. Every candidate for admission must apply (if under age, through
his parent or guardian) to the Commander-in-Chief, to have his name
entered on the list of candidates.</p>

<p>5. He must transmit with his application the following documents,
viz.: (<i>a</i>) An extract from the register of his baptism, or, in
default of that, a declaration before a magistrate, made by one of his
parents, giving his exact age. (<i>b</i>) A certificate, from the
minister of the Church or denomination to which he belongs, of his
having been duly instructed in the principles of the Christian
religion.</p>

<p>6. His name having been placed upon the list of candidates, it will
be open to him to offer himself at any of the half-yearly examinations
which may occur while he is within the prescribed limits of age. If
unsuccessful in obtaining one of the vacancies at the college, he will
be allowed to present himself at any subsequent examination until he has
exceeded the maximum age. After he has exceeded the maximum age, he can
only be admitted into the army on obtaining a direct commission by
purchase, in the usual manner, after passing a qualifying
examination.</p>

<p>7. He will be examined by a medical officer, who will ascertain
whether he is free from all bodily and organic defects, and whether, as
far as regards physical constitution, he is in every point of view fit
for military service.</p>

<p>8. The following will be the subjects of examination, but no
candidate will be allowed to be examined in more than <i>five</i> of
these subjects:</p>

<p>Of the above subjects, the elementary portions of mathematics and the
English language are obligatory on each candidate.</p>

<p>The following elementary branches will be included in the obligatory
section of mathematics, viz.:</p>

<p>In arithmetic: vulgar and decimal fractions, proportion, extraction
of the square root, and interest.</p>

<p>In algebra: fractions, simple equations, and questions producing
them.</p>

<p>In Euclid: the first three books.</p>

<p>To these elementary branches 1,200 marks (out of the whole 3,600 for
mathematics) will be allotted, and it will be necessary for
qualification that at least 400 be obtained, of which 200 must be
obtained in arithmetic.</p>

<p>In the English language 400 marks will be allotted to correct and
legible writing from dictation, and to composition; and of these it will
be necessary for qualification that 200 be obtained.</p>

<p>Out of the remaining subjects the candidate may select any three.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page578" id = "page578">578</a></span>
<p>No candidate will be allowed to count the marks gained in any of the
three voluntary subjects, unless amounting to one sixth of the whole
number of marks allotted to that subject; and for qualification he will
be required to obtain on his five subjects a total of 1,500 marks.</p>

<p>No marks will be allowed to count in any subject left optional to the
candidate, unless he gain at least one sixth of the whole number
allotted to that subject.</p>

<p>9. Every candidate will be required to forward to the Military
Secretary, Horse Guards, one month before the examination, a statement
of the subjects he desires to take up, as well as a certificate from the
master or tutor under whom he has been educated, of his general moral
conduct for at least the two preceding years. If a candidate has failed
in a previous examination he will only be required to forward a list of
the subjects he selects, and a certificate of conduct between the two
examinations. These documents are under no circumstances to be
transmitted before the date above specified.</p>

<p>10. After the examination the candidates will be reported to the
Commander-in-Chief in the order of their merit, and will be appointed
accordingly as far as vacancies will allow.</p>

<p>11. Candidates who have passed the examinations called “responsions”
and “moderations” at the University of Oxford, or those called “previous
examinations” at the Universities of Cambridge and Dublin, or the
matriculation examination of the University of London; or any one of the
three examinations required for the degree of M.A. at the Universities
of St. Andrew’s and Glasgow; or the “class examination of the second
year” (Curriculum of Arts) at the University of Aberdeen; or the
“preliminary examination” at the University of Edinburgh; or the “first
University examination” of Queen’s University, Ireland, will be
considered as qualified for admission to the Royal Military College
without further examination.</p>

<p>Candidates from the Universities must not be more than 21 years of
age for the infantry, nor more than 23 years for the cavalry. They will
be required to send to the Military Secretary, Horse Guards, two months
before the commencement of the term at which they desire to enter,
certificates from the responsible authorities of their college of
general moral conduct during residence at the University, and of having
passed the above-mentioned examinations, together with the certificate
of age, as required by clause 5</p>

<p>Should the number of general candidates be considerably in excess of
the number of vacancies at the college, a suitable portion of those
vacancies will be offered to the University and to the competing
candidates respectively.</p>

<p>12. Candidates for admission as Queen’s cadets must apply for a
nomination to the Commander-in-Chief, if the sons of officers in the
army; or to the First Lord of the Admirality, if the sons of officers in
the Royal navy, or Royal marines. The above nominations will be made by
the Commander-in-Chief or First Lord of the Admiralty, with the
concurrence of the Secretary of State for War. The Secretary of State
for India in Council will nominate to cadetships for the Indian
services.</p>


<p class = "heading"><i>Provision of Necessaries, Books, Contributions,

<p>13. Every gentleman cadet will receive from the Military Secretary a
list of the articles of clothing, books, and instruments with which he
must provide himself before joining the college, and which he will be
required to keep complete during his residence.</p>

<p>Any other books, instruments, or drawing implements that he may
subsequently require for the prosecution of his studies, will be
provided at the college, and charged to his account.</p>

<p>14. The amount of contribution for education, board, washing, and
medical attendance, on account of each cadet, per annum, is as
follows:</p>

<p>15. General officers on the non-effective list will pay according to
their last substantive rank.</p>

<p>Officers who have sold their commissions are, in this classification,
reckoned as private gentlemen.</p>

<p>The cases of officers who have retired voluntarily upon half-pay
previous to having served twenty-five years on full pay will be
specially considered.</p>

<p>Officers who retire on half-pay after twenty-five years’ service on
full pay will be classified for payment with the rank in which they last

of adjutants of the volunteer force, are admissible to the college on
the same terms as those prescribed for the sons of army and navy
officers of corresponding rank.</p>

<p>19. The sons of Indian naval and military officers not specially
nominated by the Secretary of State for India will be admitted on the
same terms as the sons of officers of the Queen’s service.</p>

<p>20. Contributions for the sons of professors at the Staff and Cadet

40</p>

<p>21. Any change which may take place by promotion or retirement in the
rank of the father of a cadet must be immediately notified to the
Military Secretary, in order that the contribution paid to the college
on account of such cadet may be regulated accordingly.</p>

<p>22. <i>Previously</i> to the admission of a cadet (not a Queen’s
cadet) he, or if a minor, his parent or guardian, will be required to
make the following payments, viz.:</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>1. His contribution for half a year.</p>
<p>2. The sum of 15<i>l.</i> for his first equipment of uniform
clothing.</p>
<p>3. The sum of 10<i>s.</i> for the support of the company
reading-rooms.</p>
<p>4. A deposit of 15<i>l.</i> on account, for contingent expenses.</p>
</div>

<p>23. The above sums are to be paid to the paymaster of the
College.</p>

<p>24. For each succeeding half year the regulated contribution is in
like manner to be paid in advance, to the paymaster of the college, to
whom must also be remitted the sum of 5<i>l.</i> for the further
provision of uniform clothing, and such sum as may be required to make
up the contingent deposit to 15<i>l.</i> The amount of this balance will
be shown by an account, rendered at the end of every half year, of the
sums paid out of the deposit during the past term.</p>

<p>25. No cadet on whose behalf these regulations in regard to payments
have not been complied with, will be received at the college.</p>

<p>26. No refund of contribution will be made for any portion of the
half year in which the cadet may be removed from the establishment,
without the special sanction of the Secretary of State for War.</p>

<p>27. No payments will be required from Queen’s or Indian cadets.</p>

<p>28. If a cadet be rusticated during a term, his contribution for the
half year will be forfeited.</p>

<p>29. If absent a whole term in consequence of rustication or sickness,
a contribution of 10<i>l.</i> will be required for the privilege of his
name being kept on the rolls of the establishment, and for a vacancy
being guaranteed at the commencement of the next term.</p>

<p>30. If absent from sickness during any portion of a term, a refund of
that portion applicable to subsistence will be permitted.</p>

<p>31. In the cases of cadets of the orphan class, whose annual
contribution is only 20<i>l.</i>, the amount to be paid when the absence
extends over a whole term will be submitted to and determined by the
Secretary of State.</p>

<p>32. Every gentleman cadet will be supplied with a weekly allowance of
pocket money, at the discretion of the commandant of the college; but
this allowance will not exceed 4<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a week for a
gentleman cadet who is a responsible under officer, 4<i>s.</i> a week
for a gentleman cadet who is an under officer, 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a
week for a gentleman cadet who is a corporal, and 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
a week for all other gentlemen cadets. The expense of this allowance
will be
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page580" id = "page580">580</a></span>
defrayed out of the amount deposited for the purpose of meeting
contingent expenses, and in the case of Queen’s or Indian cadets it will
be borne by the public.</p>


<p class = "heading"><i>Discipline.</i></p>

<p>33. All gentlemen cadets are subject to such rules and regulations as
are, or may be from time to time, established for the maintenance of
good order and discipline.</p>

<p>34. Every gentleman cadet will be liable to be removed from the
college at any time should his conduct be such as to render it obvious
that his remaining would be either hurtful to the institution or
unprofitable to himself.</p>

<p>35. To every cadet will be assigned, at the commencement of each
term, 100 marks for conduct.</p>

<p>From this number deductions will be made in certain authorized
proportions for every offence which shall have been met by a punishment
of more than two days’ drill.</p>

<p>Should the cadet forfeit more than three-fourths, or 75 of the above
100 marks, he will not be gazetted to his commission until all other
gentlemen cadets of the same batch shall have been provided for; and
should he lose all his marks for conduct he will be rusticated for one
term.</p>

<p>36. Gentlemen cadets are strictly prohibited from contracting debts
with any publican or tradesman in the vicinity of the college.</p>

<p>37. No perquisites or presents of any kind are to be received by any
person belonging to the college from either the gentlemen cadets or
their friends.</p>

<p>38. Gentlemen cadets will not be allowed to remain at the college
during the vacations without the special sanction of the Secretary of
State for War, on satisfactory proof being shown that they have no
friends in the United Kingdom to whom they could go. Payment of
1<i>l.</i> 1<i>s.</i> a week will be required in such cases from those
who are not Queen’s cadets.</p>


<p class = "heading"><i>Termination of the Course, and removal from the
College.</i></p>

<p>39. The course of study is calculated for a residence of three terms,
or 18 months, reckoned from the commencement of the term in which a
gentleman cadet may join. It is open, however, for any cadet, who at the
end of his first term shall have proved himself qualified for promotion
at once to the third term classes, to compete for a commission without
purchase, or to be examined for a commission by purchase, at the end of
his second term; but no fourth term will be allowed on any plea but that
of long continued sickness, in which case special application must be
made to the Commander-in-Chief, accompanied by an opinion from the
surgeon of the college.</p>

<p>Gentlemen cadets allowed a fourth term will not be permitted to
compete for commissions without purchase.</p>

<p>40. Examinations for commissions will be held periodically. The
number of commissions to be given without purchase will be announced
previously to the examination. These will be competed for and awarded to
the candidates who are first in order of merit.</p>

<p>41. Candidates who have not succeeded in obtaining a place amongst
those to whom commissions without purchase can be awarded, but who have
obtained the minimum number of marks required for qualification, will be
considered to have prior claims to all other candidates for commissions
by purchase.</p>

<p>42. Queen’s and Indian cadets will receive commissions without
purchase on passing the qualifying examination. The names of those who
distinguish themselves equally with competitors for commissions without
purchase will be published in the same lists with the latter.</p>

<p>43. In every case a certificate of conduct and proficiency in
military and athletic exercises will be required from the governor of
the college before a cadet can be examined for his commission.</p>

<p>44. Any gentleman cadet desirous of entering the Royal Artillery or
Royal Engineers will be permitted, if otherwise eligible, to offer
himself as a candidate at any of the competitive examinations for
admission into the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich; and his position
at the Royal Military College will not be affected by his failure at
such examination.</p>

<p>45. No gentleman cadet will be allowed to present himself at a direct
commission examination during his residence at the Royal Military
College.</p>

<p>46. No gentleman cadet is to be removed from the college without the
permission of the Commander-in-Chief, obtained through the governor of
the
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page581" id = "page581">581</a></span>
college. And when a parent or guardian intends to withdraw a cadet, or,
if of age, the gentleman cadet intends to leave the college at the end
of a term, at least six weeks’ notice of his intention is to be given to
the governor. In default of such notice a quarter’s subscription must be
paid.</p>

<p class = "heading"><i>Miscellaneous.</i></p>

<p>47. The establishment for Queen’s cadets having been sanctioned by
Parliament when the age of admission to the Royal Military College was
from 13 to 15 years, it has been decided that in any case when the
services of the father and the circumstances of his family are such as
to constitute a claim, an addition of not more than 40<i>l.</i> a year
to the “compassionate allowance” may, at the discretion of the Secretary
of State for War, be allowed to a candidate who is over 13, to enable
him to complete his preparatory education, as he is ineligible for
immediate admission into the college in consequence of the minimum age
of admission having been raised to 16.</p>

<p>48. It is desirable that every candidate who is under 21 years of age
should, at his admission, be accompanied by his parent, guardian, or
some other responsible person, to satisfy the requirements of the
college on his behalf.</p>

<p>49. The responsible parent or guardian of every successful candidate,
and the candidate himself, before he can be admitted as a cadet, will be
required to sign respectively the following declarations:</p>

<p class = "heading"><i>Declaration by Cadet.</i></p>

<p>“I ___________________, do hereby declare that I have attentively
considered the regulations for admission to the Royal Military College,
and I consent to abide by the same in every particular, as well as to

<p>In order to qualify for a commission, every gentleman cadet will be
required to obtain 1,950 marks in the obligatory section of
fortification, military drawing and surveying, military history, the
first section of mathematics, and one foreign language; of which number
of marks 1,300 must be gained in the three <i>military</i> subjects
before specified.</p>

<h5><a name = "britain_sandhurst_subjects" id =
"britain_sandhurst_subjects" href = "#britain_sandhurst">SUBJECTS AND
COURSE OF INSTRUCTION.</a></h5>

<p>The studies of the college are mathematics, fortification, military
drawing and surveying, military history and geography, and one modern
language (either French or German), which are obligatory on all cadets,
and, in the final examination 1,950 marks (out of 5,400 required), with
a certificate of proficiency in military and athletic exercises, are
required to qualify for a commission. To these studies are added
chemistry or physics, geology, and a second modern language.</p>

<p>For educational purposes, the cadet corps is divided into three
companies, designated A, B, C, each company pursuing the same subjects
at the same time, with a classification of members into sections,
according to the results of the minor and term examinations. The minor
examinations take place every six weeks, and the term examinations every
six months, and the final examination at the close of the course, which
occupies three terms of six months each. The final examination is
conducted by examiners attached to the Council of Military Education.
The final result, as bearing on a commission, is reached by adding the
marks as determined by the average of the minor and term examinations,
and the answers of the final examination.</p>

<p>The instruction is given in halls of study, of which there are 18,
large enough to accommodate, each, 18 cadets, but generally occupied by
15.&nbsp;The lecture hall will accommodate 100 without crowding.</p>

<p>1. <i>Mathematics</i>, elementary for all sections, including
arithmetic, algebra up to simple equations, euclid, the use of
logarithmic tables, elementary problems in heights and distances, and
mensuration; and higher in the third section, including trigonometry and
practical mechanics and hydrostatics, occupies 21 hours a week during
the entire residence. To this branch is assigned a professor, one senior
master, and three other masters. To the highest proficiency in
mathematics is assigned a maximum of 1,200 marks, and a minimum of 300
is allowed to count.</p>

<p>2. <i>Fortification</i> includes field and the elements of permanent
fortification, with a preparatory course of practical geometry. To this
study, which occupies three hours every day, or 18 hours per week, are
assigned six professors, and to the highest
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page583" id = "page583">583</a></span>
proficiency is awarded a maximum of 1,800 marks, with a minimum of 450.
Field fortification is taught in the first two terms, plan drawing and
practical work going on together. The cadets trace and execute portions
of fieldworks, making and planting revetement, gabions, and fascines,
and doing all but the heavy work, which is left to the sappers. They are
also instructed in bridge making and in pontooning, and witness every
species of work done in the hall, on the fortification ground.</p>

<p>3. <i>Military Surveying and Drawing</i> occupy together 17 hours,
under 12 professors. The cadets commence by drawing from copies, then
from models, being in the meantime also taught the use of instruments;
then in six weeks after joining the corps, they are taken out to
triangulate with the prismatic compass and pacing, and traverse roads.
The former practice with the theodilite and sextant has been abandoned,
and the whole instruction has been concentrated on the art of field
sketching as of more importance to an infantry officer. To the highest
proficiency in this subject is given 1,800 marks, and a minimum of 450
is allowed to count in the final result. In the final examination the
candidate for a commission must obtain at least 1,200 marks in the above
subjects.</p>

<p>4. <i>Military History and Geography</i> is under the charge of one
professor and two instructors. The present course is to give instruction
by lecture, in the organization and mode of action of the three arms,
and explanation of the operation of the commissariat and transport
department of an army, followed by a short and simple campaign. In the
second half-year, two campaigns are selected, with a view to illustrate
the generally received principles of tactics and strategy, and in the
third half-year one campaign is thoroughly worked out in detail. The
cadets take notes of the lecture, on which they are examined orally, and
after the main propositions and facts are printed by the professor, a
subsequent study and examination on the printed scheme is had. In this
study the cadets draw plans of the theatre of war and of battles,
showing the position of the opposing forces.</p>

<p>5. <i>Languages</i>, French and German,&mdash;the former with one
professor and three masters, and the latter with one master. The usual
course in either language is grammar, exercises, dictation, translation,
and composition. To the highest proficiency
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page584" id = "page584">584</a></span>
in either, 1,200 marks are assigned, and a minimum of 300 is allowed.
One of these languages is obligatory in the final examination, but the
candidate can be examined in both. The cadets can change from one
language to the other at the beginning of the term.</p>

<p>6. <i>Chemistry</i> (including sound, heat, electricity, and
magnetism) and <i>Geology</i> (including mineralogy and physical
geography) occupy each a half hour four days in the week, and employ
part of the time of two professors.</p>

<p>7. <i>Freehand or Landscape Drawing</i> receives two lessons per
week, first from copies and models, and in the third term one lesson per
week from nature. To the highest proficiency is assigned 600 marks, and
a minimum of 150 is allowed.</p>

<p>8. <i>Military exercises</i> enter into the programme for the day,
and consist of gymnastics for the first term, gun-drill and riding (one
lesson per week) in the second term, and two lessons in the last
exercises for the third term. Parade and infantry drill occupy, in
addition, half an hour before breakfast, and 50 minutes between the
first and second period of study in the morning (9.30 and 10.50).</p>

<p>For qualification a cadet must obtain an aggregate of 1,200 marks out
of 5,400 on the three military subjects, and a total aggregate of 1,950
of these. Similar proportions of marks must be obtained each term that
the cadet may return in the following term.</p>

NOTICE.</a></h5>

<p><span class = "firstword">The</span> Military Academy at Woolwich was
instituted by George II. in 1741, to give instruction to officers who
served in the Artillery and Engineers. It began in a small room in a
building at Woolwich, where the Board of Ordnance used occasionally to
assemble, under the instruction of two masters, who lectured by rotation
during four consecutive hours in three days of every week. At first only
the officers of the single battalion composing the Artillery, and of the
corps of Engineers, were required to attend. In the second year
non-commissioned officers, and privates too, were at liberty to attend,
and upon its close cadets, to the number of five to each company of
artillery, resorted to the hall. Being sons of officers of the corps,
and not in uniform or under military control, the cadets became an
element of disorder, which led to a more systematic organization. In
1744, the cadets were clothed in uniform, and collected into a distinct
company, under two officers, with a drum-major. By 1782, the number of
cadets had increased from twenty to sixty, and in 1798, to one
hundred,&mdash;boarding with their families. In the last year
arrangements were made to lodge and board the cadets by allowing
2<i>s.</i> a day per head, until by degrees, in 1857, an imposing pile
of buildings had been erected, and the establishment for government and
instruction consisted of 18 officers on the military staff, and some
fifty professors and masters in the civil and educational corps.</p>


<h5><a name = "britain_woolwich_admission" id =

ADMISSION.</a></h5>

<p>Previously to the year 1855 admission to the Royal Military Academy
could only be obtained by a nomination from the Master-General of the
Ordnance. The limits of age for admission were at that time from 14 to
16, and the candidates
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page586" id = "page586">586</a></span>
nominated were required to pass an entrance examination before the
professors of the Academy, which varied somewhat according to the age of
the individual. A&nbsp;certain number of the candidates previously
passed though the preparatory school at Carshalton, admission to which
was equally obtained by nomination from the Master-General of the
Ordnance, and were transferred to the Academy on passing an examination
similar to that required from those who entered the latter establishment
direct. The term of residence at the Academy varied, according to the
progress of a cadet, from two to four years.</p>

<p>The inability of the Academy to meet the demand for officers for the
Artillery and Engineers created by the Crimean war, led to the
introduction of a new system of obtaining commissions in the scientific
corps. At first a limited number of nominations were placed in the hands
of the head masters of the great public schools of the country, and the
candidates nominated by them were appointed to provisional commissions
on passing an examination at Woolwich; but after a short time the
principle of open competition for admission to the Artillery and
Engineers was adopted, in 1855, by Lord Panmure, when Secretary of State
for War. Simultaneously with this change&mdash;the first recognition of
the competitive principle in regard to military education in this
country&mdash;a great alteration was made in the limits of age for
admission to the scientific corps. Both direct appointments to
commissions in the Artillery and Engineers, without any previous special
instruction, and admissions to the senior or practical class at the
Academy, without passing through the lower or theoretical classes at
that institution, were thrown open to public competition among all
natural-born subjects of Her Majesty. The limits of age for candidates
for the direct appointments were from 19 to 21.&nbsp;Those who were
successful were in the first instance to receive provisional
commissions, and to be placed for instruction under the Director of
Artillery Studies, at Woolwich, for a period of about six months, at the
end of which they were to be permanently commissioned. Candidates for
admission to the practical class at the Academy were required to be
between the ages of 17 and 19; those admitted were to remain in the
practical class for six or eight months, after which, on passing an
examination, they were to receive commissions
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page587" id = "page587">587</a></span>
in the Artillery or Engineers. The first competitive examination under
this system (the regulations for which will be found below) was held in
August, 1855, and was conducted by a body of examiners specially
appointed for the purpose, under the direction of Canon Moseley. The
examination for both classes of appointments thrown open to competition
was the same, and was based on the general education of the country, the
object being merely to compare the abilities and attainments of the
candidates without reference to special professional knowledge. Two
other similar examinations, both for provisional commissions and for
admission to the practical class, were held in January and June, 1856,
the only difference being that the limits of age of the candidates were
somewhat extended, and that in these later examinations no commissions
in the <i>Engineers</i> were offered to competition.</p>

<p>On the conclusion of the Crimean war, however, the system of
appointing officers directly from civil life to commissions in the
scientific corps, as well as that of admitting candidates to the
practical class at the Academy, which had been adopted to meet the
pressure of the war, came to an end. No other examination after that in
June, 1856, was held for a year; but in June, 1857, the first
competitive examination for admission to the ordinary course of
instruction at the Academy took place. The limits of age for admission
were fixed at 17 to 20, and it was announced that the successful
candidates would remain under instruction at the Academy “until
sufficiently advanced in scientific knowledge to pass a satisfactory
examination.”</p>

<p>Since this period open competitive examinations have been held
regularly every six months for admission to the Academy; and though
various modifications in their details have been made, their general
character remains little altered. The limits of age for candidates,
originally placed at 17 to 20, were, however, in 1862, reduced to 16 to
19, at which they are at present fixed.</p>

<p>The examinations for admission to the Academy, like those which had
previously been held for provisional commissions and for appointments to
the practical class, were at first conducted by Canon Moseley and a
special Board of Examiners appointed by the Secretary of State for War,
with whom the general management of the Academy, after the abolition of
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page588" id = "page588">588</a></span>
the office of Master-General of the Ordnance, remained. In 1858,
however, the superintendence of the system of instruction at Woolwich
was transferred to the Council of Military Education, who, since July,
1859, have conducted the examinations.</p>

<p>Although the principle of open competition for appointments in the
scientific corps was first recognized in 1855, and in 1857 was extended
generally to admission to the ordinary course of instruction at the
Academy, yet the system of competitive examination did not become the
sole and universal means of admission to Woolwich until the year 1861.
Time was required to clear off the vested interests of candidates who
had been placed on the old nomination list of the Master-General of the
Ordnance; of youths who had been admitted to the preparatory school at
Carshalton; of cadets who, at the time of the proposed amalgamation of
Sandhurst and Woolwich, had obtained admission to the former institution
on the understanding that they would have the opportunity of obtaining
commissions in the Artillery and Engineers; and, lastly, of cadets at
the Indian Military College at Addiscombe, who, on the abolition of the
local Indian army, were transferred to Woolwich before receiving
commissions in the Royal Artillery and Royal Engineers.</p>

<p>Out of 3,085 admission examinations in eleven years, from 1858 to
1868, more than one-half (2,136) failed. Of those who entered after this
trial, in the same length of time, only three failed to pass the final
examination.</p>

<p>Every candidate must qualify in geometrical drawing; <i>i.e.</i>,
drawing in ink, with accuracy, neatness, and to scale, the several
problems of Euclid. The standard of qualification in this subject is 100
marks, which must be gained, out of a maximum of 300 nominally assigned
to it. But the marks so gained will not count toward the general
aggregate.</p>

<p>III. No candidate will be allowed to be examined in more than five
subjects, of which one must be mathematics, and no one who does not
obtain at least 700 marks in section I. of pure mathematics, will be
eligible for an appointment.</p>

<p>From the other subjects of examination, to which marks are assigned
as above, each candidate may select any, not exceeding four in number,
in which he desires to be examined. The rules for counting marks in such
subjects are as follows:</p>

<p>In all subjects carrying marks, except the 1st section of
mathematics, in which 700 marks are required, one-sixth of the number
allotted to each must be gained before they can be allowed to count.</p>

<p>In classics, the subject is divided into two sections as above,
either or both of which the candidate may take up as one subject; but he
will not be allowed to count the marks gained in either section unless
they amount to one-sixth of the number allotted to it.</p>

<p>In either <i>French</i>, <i>German</i>, or <i>Hindustani</i>, every
candidate will be required to obtain for qualification one-sixth of the
maximum of marks, whether he takes it up as a subject in which he
desires to compete or not.</p>

<p>It should be understood that, although only a small qualifying test
has been imposed in respect to modern languages, a knowledge of them on
admission will contribute greatly to a candidate’s future success at the
Royal Military Academy.</p>

<p>IV. The candidates are allowed to answer as many questions as the
time allotted to the subject will permit.</p>

<p>V. No candidate will be admitted unless he obtain an aggregate of at
least 2,500 marks.</p>

<p>VI. The successful candidates will remain under instruction for about
two years and a half, or until they are sufficiently advanced in
scientific knowledge to pass a satisfactory examination, and they will
then be qualified to receive commissions in the Royal Artillery or Royal
Engineers. If, however, they should be found unable to qualify
themselves within three years in their professional studies, or to
acquire a sufficient proficiency in military exercises, or if at any
time, by failure at the half-yearly examinations, it should appear
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page590" id = "page590">590</a></span>
improbable that they will ultimately succeed in qualifying for a
commission, they will be removed. Further, every cadet will be liable to
be removed temporarily or permanently on the commission of any of those
offences to which such penalty is awarded by the regulations of the
Royal Military Academy.</p>

<p>VII. Each cadet on joining will be required to pay a sum of
25<i>l.</i> to cover the expense of uniform, books, etc., and to bring
with him the articles of clothing of which he will receive notice, and
which must afterward be kept up at his own expense. He will also be
required to pay a contribution of 62<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i>, payable in
advance, for each half year of the time during which he remains under
instruction; and a deposit of 5<i>l.</i> into the hands of the paymaster
on account, for contingent expenses, which latter sum he will be
required to make up on returning to the Royal Military Academy after
each vacation, to cover any unavoidable expense that may be incurred on
his account during the ensuing half year.</p>

<p>The annual contributions, however, for sons and orphans of naval and
military officers will be regulated at the <ins class = "correction"
title = "text has ‘followig’">following</ins> rates, as heretofore:</p>

<table class = "plaintext numbers">
<tr>
<td>For sons of admirals and of generals having regiments,</td>

regimental field officers of the army,</td>
<td>60</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>For sons of all officers of the army and navy under the above
ranks,</td>
<td>40</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>For sons of all officers of the army and navy who have died in the
service, and whose families are proved to be left in pecuniary
distress,</td>
<td>20</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The sons of general officers who are paid only on their commissions
as field officers will pay the same contributions as the sons of field
officers.</p>

<p>Officers who have sold their commissions are in this classification
reckoned as private gentlemen.</p>

<p>The cases of officers who have retired voluntarily upon half pay
previous to having served 25 years on full pay will be specially
considered.</p>

<p>Officers who retire on half pay after 25 years’ service on full pay
will be entitled to be classified for payment with the rank they last
served in.</p>

<p>The sons of officers of the civil departments of the army and navy,
of officers of the permanent Militia Staff, and of adjutants of the
Volunteer Force, are admissible to the Academy upon the same terms as
those prescribed for naval and military officers.</p>

<p>The sons of Indian naval and military officers will be admitted on
the same terms as the sons of officers of the Queen’s service.</p>

<p>If a cadet be absent a whole term in consequence of sickness or
rustication, a payment of 10<i>l.</i> will be required for the privilege
of his name being kept on the rolls of the establishment, and for a
vacancy being guaranteed at the commencement of the next term.</p>

<p>If a cadet be absent from sickness during a portion of the term, his
pay will continue to be issued and credited to his account; but no
refund of the contribution will be permitted.</p>

<p>If rusticated during a term, the daily pay will cease from the date
on which the cadet is sent away, and the contribution made for the half
year will be forfeited.</p>

<p>In the case of a cadet of the orphan class, whose annual contribution
is only 20<i>l.</i>, the amount to be paid when absence extends over a
whole term is to be determined by the Secretary of State.</p>

<p>VIII. Any gentleman who wishes to present himself at one of the
half-yearly examinations must send in his name to the military secretary
at the Horse Guards one month before the time of examination, forwarding
with his application to be noted the following papers:</p>

<div class = "inlist">
<p>1st. An extract from the register of his baptism, or, in default of
that, a declaration before a magistrate, made by one of his parents,
giving his exact age.</p>

<p>2d. A certificate of good moral character, signed by a clergyman of
the parish to which he belongs, and by the tutor or head of the school
or college at which he has received his education for at least the two
preceding years, or such other proof of good moral character as will be
satisfactory to the Commander-in-Chief.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page591" id = "page591">591</a></span>
<p>3d. A statement of the subjects of examination in which (in addition
to mathematics) he may desire to be examined.</p>
</div>

<p>A candidate who has been examined before, when he applies for leave
to present himself again, will only be required to forward the list of
subjects he selects, and a certificate from his tutor or the head of his
school, etc., for the interval between the two examinations.</p>

<p>IX. The candidates will be inspected by military surgeons on the
first day of the examination, in order that it may be ascertained that
they are free from any bodily defects or ailments calculated to
interfere with the performance of military duties.</p>

<p>Extreme short-sight, or any serious defect of vision, is regarded as
a disqualification.</p>

<p>The responsible parent or guardian of every successful candidate, and
the candidate himself, before he can be admitted as a cadet, are
required to sign, respectively, obligations to conform to the
regulations.</p>

STAFF OF INSTRUCTION.</a></h5>

<p>For instruction the Cadets are divided into five classes of equal
strength, according to length of residence; forty-four in the first four
classes, and forty-six in the junior. The subjects are:</p>

<p>1. Mathematics, under a professor and four instructors, is studied in
three classes, and the final examination is held after a residence of a
year and a half, with a maximum of 6,800 marks in all.</p>

<p>2. Fortification, under a professor and four instructors, is studied
in four classes. The final examination is in the last class, and the
maximum of marks attainable in all is 6,300.</p>

<p>3. Artillery, under a professor and three instructors, is studied in
two classes; the second and first, and the final examination, is in the
first, with a maximum of 6,200 marks.</p>

<p>4. Surveying and topographical drawing, under a professor and four
instructors, is studied in all the classes, and the final examination is
at the completion of the course, with a total of 4,200 marks.</p>

<p>5. Practical Geometry, under a professor and two instructors, is
studied in two classes, and the final examination is at the close of the
first year, with an aggregate of 2,100 marks.</p>

<p>6. Mechanics and Natural Philosophy, under one professor, are studied
in the last two terms, and the final examination is in the last, with a
maximum of 1,600 marks in the former, and 900 in the latter.</p>

<p>7. French and German are studied, each under a professor and two
instructors, for four terms, and after the final examination in the
second class. The total marks in each is 1,500. Hindustani can be
substituted for German.</p>

<p>8. Landscape Drawing, under two instructors, is studied in three
classes, and the final examination is in the third class, with a maximum
of 1,500 marks.</p>

<p>9. Military History is taught by one professor in the last two terms,
and has a maximum of 2,000 marks.</p>

<p>10. Chemistry, under one lecturer, is taught in the last term, and
receives a total of 1,200 marks.</p>

<p>11. Gymnastics, drill, and riding are taught as follows: Regular
gymnastic instruction is conducted by a superintendent and three
sergeants, for at least six months, and practised through all the terms.
Artillery drill, with gun, sword, and other military drill and tactics,
are conducted partly by military officers and partly by the professors
and instructors of artillery. Riding drill is conducted under the
officers of the Royal Artillery, in the last two terms, and is practised
four or five hours a week. Swimming is taught optionally.</p>

<p>12. Recreations and amusements are optional and at the expense of the
Cadets. Workshops are maintained by the government, but tools and
materials are furnished at the expense of the Cadets. There are two
reading rooms.</p>

<h5><a name = "britain_woolwich_preparation" id =
"britain_woolwich_preparation" href = "#britain_woolwich">SCHOOL
PREPARATION FOR WOOLWICH.</a></h5>

<p>From the returns and evidence furnished, it is an extremely rare
occurrence for a candidate to go up direct from a public school which
does not possess a Modern Department to the examination for admission to
Woolwich. Out of 855 candidates admitted to Woolwich in 10
years&mdash;from 1858 to 1867&mdash;the six public schools of Eton,
Harrow, Rugby, Winchester, Westminster, and Shrewsbury, only sent up
five direct. Colonel Addison states that at Sandhurst, out of 320
admissions during the last two years, there have been only 16 from the
nine schools mentioned in the Report of the Royal Commission on Public
Schools; but from Cheltenham and Wellington College the admissions have
been more numerous. Even for the direct commission examination, those
who present themselves from public schools (including Cheltenham and
Marlborough, where Modern Departments exist), without seeking the
assistance of a private tutor, scarcely amount to five per cent. of the
whole number of candidates. At the same time, it may be observed that
the proportion of failures among such candidates in the latter
examination is comparatively slight, not amounting to more than 8 per
cent., while the average number of failures among the candidates
generally during the last four years has been very nearly 25 per cent.
In fact, the general tenor of the evidence goes to show that, in the
case of the examinations both for direct commissions and for admission
to Sandhurst, there is, or at least should be, no necessity for
candidates who have had the ordinary education of a classical public
school to have recourse to private tuition. The Woolwich examination
appears generally to be regarded in a different light. Its higher and
more special character, and the great importance attached to
mathematics, coupled with the competition which exists for it, render it
apparently doubtful whether success would generally be obtained by
candidates from public schools&mdash;other than those where, like
Cheltenham, instruction is given with a particular view to this
examination&mdash;without a special preparatory tuition.</p>

<p>The general character of the “Modern Side” at Harrow, which was
established in September of 1869, “for the benefit of boys for whom,
from various causes, an advanced classical training seems undesirable,”
is explained as follows in a circular issued by the Head-Master when
announcing the intention of adopting the institution:</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page593" id = "page593">593</a></span>
<div class = "in-one">
<p>The principal subjects of instruction on the “Modern Side” will be
mathematics, French, German, Latin, history, English literature, and
physical science.</p>

<p>The requirements of boys not intended for the Universities will be
specially kept in view, including the case of those who are candidates
for Woolwich or the Indian Civil Service. It is hoped that this
provision may obviate the supposed necessity for removing boys to a
private tutor’s precisely at an age when the influences of public school
life are most powerful and most salutary.</p>

<p>Except for purposes of instruction there will be no distinction
whatever between boys on the Modern Side and boys on the Classical
Side.</p>

<p>No boy will, for the present, be admitted to the Modern Side unless
he has been in the school for at least a year, and has hitherto shown
diligence and made fair progress.</p>
</div>

<p>The nature of the instruction in the “Army Class” at Eton is
described by the Head-Master (Rev. Dr. Hornly) as follows:</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>The Army Class was established by Dr. Goodrich in the year 1858. It
was established in order to give Eton boys greater facilities for
preparing certain subjects which were required in the army examinations,
and to obviate the supposed necessity of giving Eton boys a special
preparation, elsewhere than at <ins class = "correction"
title = "text has ‘Eaton’">Eton</ins>, in order to fit them for the army
examinations.</p>

<p>At first fortification and military drawing were included in the
course, and a considerable proportion of the ordinary school work
(<i>e.g.</i>, Latin verse writing) was remitted.</p>

<p>This was not found to answer. The course included more than was
necessary for the ordinary army examination, and not enough for the
higher examinations at Woolwich. There seemed to be a danger of the
class becoming a sort of refuge for the idlest boys in the school.</p>

<p>Dr. Goodford subsequently altered all this, and placed the class upon
its present footing, which is as follows:</p>

<p>Two lessons a week (repetition lessons) are remitted to make time for
lessons in modern history. English essays, or abstracts of what has been
taught in school, are written by the boys out of school (one exercise a
week), and carefully looked over. No other part of the ordinary school
work (except the two repetition lessons) is given up. Boys cannot join
the class till they are 16 years of age. They are expected to stay at
Eton till the time comes for their examination. The class consists at
present of 28 boys, with an average of 25.</p>

<p>The class has certainly been successful. No boy going up from Eton
has failed yet in the army examination since the reconstitution of the
class of which I have spoken. I&nbsp;think the class has done good in
the school.</p>

<p>It will be seen that nothing more has been seriously attempted as yet
than to secure boys from failure in the ordinary examinations. If boys
are to be prepared at Eton for any higher competition, such as that at
Woolwich, a very different course will obviously be necessary, and
probably a system of “bifurcation” will be found indispensable.</p>

<p>I am not prepared to say that this may not be introduced with
advantage at Eton; but the impending changes in the governing body at
Eton, and the anticipated changes with regard to army examinations, make
it difficult to commence any work of reconstruction at the present
moment.</p>
</div>

<p>The most successful institutions in preparing candidates either for
Sandhurst or Woolwich are the Cheltenham and Wellington
Colleges&mdash;each having a Modern Department, in which Latin and Greek
yield their supremacy to modern science and living languages.</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>The Modern Department in Cheltenham College was established in 1843
as a Military School, and is claimed to be such at this time. The
studies of subjects consist of mathematics, drawing of all kinds,
physical science, two modern languages (French and German), English,
surveying, and fortification, both field and permanent. The principal
(Rev. T.&nbsp;A. Southend), in his evidence before the Military
Education Commission in 1869, states that his pupils, at
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page594" id = "page594">594</a></span>
the age of eighteen, went through the whole Addiscombe course, and all
that was done at Woolwich, and a good deal of what was done at Chatham.
The whole of his class, in 1868, went up for the entrance examination at
Sandhurst, and passed. From twelve to fifteen go to Woolwich every year,
and in 1869, forty out of one hundred and twenty in the Academy were
prepared at Cheltenham. The special military instruction is based on a
course of Latin and Greek.</p>

<p>Out of three hundred and twelve students in Wellington College,
ninety-six boys are in the Modern Side, entering at the age of twelve
and thirteen, and remaining till seventeen or eighteen. But of the
ninety-six, forty are preparing for the Engineers or Artillery, and
twenty for the Line. The subjects taught in the military division are
the same as at Cheltenham, except fortification; and the head-master
(Rev. Dr. Benson) claims, in his evidence before the Commission, that
his graduates are as well trained in the same subject as the pupils of
Sandhurst or Woolwich. He advises the establishment of exhibitions in
the Military School, open to competition to the pupils of all the public
schools, and regards the modern side as an essential feature in all
public schools.</p>
</div>

<p>Rugby School was the earliest of the great Public Schools of England
to make Physical Science a regular part of its curriculum, and to give
any considerable prominence to modern languages and history; but its
governing authorities have resisted all efforts to establish a distinct
Modern Side.</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>The Rev. Dr. Temple, head-master of Rugby School (now Bishop of
Exeter), in his evidence before the Commission, remarked that the
general education of boys entering Sandhurst should be the same as that
given to other boys of the same age, destined for any other profession
than that of arms. His opinion was adverse to having a modern
department, in which the ancient classics held a subordinate place, in a
school in which the classics held the first, and over which the
head-master presided. The modern studies should have an independent
scope, and their own master, who will by his character and personal
attention fix the standard of attainment. The great public schools
should hold on to their present aim and methods, introducing other
studies to perfect their mental discipline and results. No side sections
or departments in any existing school can do the work of scientific
school culture so thoroughly as an independent school, in which the
natural sciences and modern languages are taught by the main staff of
professors. All teachers, in any school, civil or military, should be
specially appointed for their educational qualities.</p>
</div>

<p>In Marlborough College, a modern department exists, which was
established to prepare boys for definite examinations in which they
would not succeed if they competed direct from the classical side of the
College, and at the same time to solve the problem of giving a good
school education on a basis of instruction in which the dead languages
hold a subordinate place. Boys enter the Modern School after they have
reached the fourth form in the classical department, so that Latin and
Greek constitute a substantial part of their attainments and discipline.
The success of the graduates of this institution in competing for
admission into the military or civil service of the government, or in
any of the walks of active or professional life, shows conclusively that
the modern curriculum with its studies properly adjusted, and a well
trained staff, under an able head-master, is quite equal to the
classical, not only in practical utility, but in comprehensive and
liberal discipline.</p>

NON-COMMISSIONED OFFICERS AND SAPPERS.</a></h5>

<p>All recruits for this corps join at Chatham, and for about sixteen
months are subject to daily drill and military duties in field work and
all branches of the engineer service, and are drafted off, from time to
time, into the special classes in construction, photography, telegraphy,
lithography, printing.</p>

<p class = "heading"><i>Synopsis of the Course.</i></p>

<p>The following synopsis of the instruction given at the Royal School
of Military Engineering at Chatham, was drawn up by Major General
J.&nbsp;L. Simmons, the Director of the establishment.</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p class = "smallhead">I.&mdash;THE SURVEY COURSE.</p>

<p>The course of surveying for the officers of the Royal Engineers is
intended to qualify them for carrying on survey operations of every
description, and for designing and laying out engineering works, so far
as these are influenced by the features of the ground on which they are
placed, or over which they are carried.</p>

<p>The course consists of two parts,&mdash;the one relating to surveying
processes exclusively, the other to the uses made of the plans and maps
prepared by such processes, for engineering purposes.</p>

<p>Under the first of these divisions the officers are practically
instructed in astronomical, general, special, and reconnoitring
surveying, including the accurate delineation of the inequalities of
ground by levelling and by contours traced instrumentally, and also the
giving reliefs to hill forms by sketching with the pen and drawing with
the brush.</p>

<p>Under the second division they are exercised in the adaptation of
works of fortification to contoured sites, and in the selection and
survey of lines of communication by roads, railways, and canals, and in
drawing up projects for their execution.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page597" id = "page597">597</a></span>
<p class = "heading"><i>Astronomical Surveying.</i></p>

<p>The officers are taught the construction and use of astronomical
instruments, and are practised in making observations with them. They
study from published works and memoranda printed at the establishment,
the most useful problems for finding the time, the latitude and
longitude, the direction of the meridian, and the variation of the
compass.</p>

<p>Examples of each problem are worked out by them from their own
observations or from observations made in their presence.</p>

<p>The use of meteorological <ins class = "correction"
title = "text has ‘intruments’">instruments</ins> and the reductions of the observations
made with them are also practised.</p>

<p class = "heading"><i>General Survey.</i></p>

<p>As a preliminary exercise in drawing each officer constructs a plate
of scales from data supplied to him. For particular information on the
delicate and powerful instruments and apparatus which have been used in
great national surveys, and which cannot be studied in the establishment
observatory, the officers are referred to published works; and they are
instructed in the adjustments, the unavoidable errors of construction,
and the powers of the instruments put into their hands for the execution
of their survey course.</p>

<p>The general survey comprises:</p>

<p>1st. <i>The selection and measurement of a base.</i>&mdash;The base
is measured with an ordinary chain and a five-inch theodolite, and this
measurement having been reduced to its horizontal value at the level of
the sea, the section of the base is laid down on paper.</p>

<p>2d. <i>Triangulation.</i>&mdash;The measured base is extended by a
triangulation over 10 or 16 square miles of country, and the relative
altitudes of, and the distances between, the stations selected are
determined from observations. The computed horizontal distances are laid
down, and the azimuth of one of them is determined.</p>

<p>3d. <i>Traversing.</i>&mdash;The positions of the roads, streams,
boundaries of woods, and other marked features, surrounding and
intersecting an area of six or eight square miles of the country
triangulated, are then determined by running traverses with a theodolite
from one station to another, so as to cut up this area into spaces which
will admit of being filled in by a less accurate method, without
introducing an error in the plan.</p>

<p>4th. <i>Plotting of detail and completion of the work.</i>&mdash;The
protracted lines are now transferred to another sheet of paper, and the
detail, obtained as the traverses proceed, is plotted from the
field-book. From this plot sketch sheets are prepared, and the remainder
of the work is sketched in with the aid of a prismatic compass, the form
of the ground being represented by pencil strokes, assisted by contours
put in with the aid of a portable level.</p>

<p>The sketch sheets are etched in with a pen, and a finished brush-work
plan of the complete survey, embracing all the information collected, is
prepared from them, with the original plotted detail, as a basis.</p>

<p class = "heading"><i>Special Survey.</i></p>

<p>A piece of ground, about half a mile in area, is surveyed with minute
accuracy as for some special purpose, and is laid down on a scale
sufficiently large to admit of the calculation of the areas of the
enclosures from the paper. The method followed is the same as that
pursued on the Ordnance Survey, and with the Tithe Commutation Surveys,
etc.</p>

<p><i>Contouring.</i>&mdash;On the ground thus specially surveyed
contours are traced instrumentally at given vertical distances apart and
are plotted on the plan.</p>

<p class = "heading"><i>Military Reconnaissance.</i></p>

<p>This is conducted on principles similar to those which govern the
operations of the general survey; the instruments employed, however, are
all portable. The measurement of a base is made by such means as readily
offer themselves (generally by pacing), and the trigonometrical points
are fixed simply by protracting angles observed with a box sextant or
compass. The whole of the remaining features and details considered
necessary in a military point of view are sketched in with the aid of
bearings and pacing. The reconnaissance embraces about six square
miles.</p>

<p>In addition to the topographical sketch of the ground, each officer
sends in a detailed report of its general character, its resources, and
military capabilities. Each officer also makes a hasty reconnaissance of
a road with a view to
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page598" id = "page598">598</a></span>
its employment as a military communication. All the information which
can be obtained as to the character of the country through which it
passes, and towns and villages near it, together with the construction,
gradients, etc., of the road, are noted on the face of the sketch.</p>


<p class = "heading"><i>Fortification Branch.</i></p>

<p>Every officer is required, in this branch of the survey course, to
design one or more works of defence for the occupation of a site, of
which a contoured plan is furnished to him.</p>

<p>In performing this exercise the officer becomes, expert in reading
the various forms and slopes of ground, as expressed by contours; he
meets with and learns to provide for some of the many modifications of
the conditions of defence which the occupation of irreglar sites
necessitates, and he acquires facility in the application of descriptive
geometry to the determination of the planes of defilade and the several
planes of a work.</p>

<p>The data upon, which, the design, is framed consist of a plan of
ground shown by contours and of some of the conditions to be filled by
the proposed fortification, such as the objects for which; the site is
occupied, the strength of the garrison, the extent, of the works, the
nature of the defence of the ditches, the trace, or the, profile to be
adopted, etc.</p>

<p>On the completion of his design the officer writes a report
explanatory of the character of the works, he has adopted, and
describing his arrangements both for the distant and near defence, with
any improvements which have suggested themselves in working it out; and
since the scale of the design, admits of considerable accuracy in its
preparation, he is required to enter very fully into the detail of the
arrangement he proposes.</p>

<p>The report is accompanied by tables showing how the remblai and
deblai are equalized, and that the distribution of the latter is,
economical.</p>


<p class = "heading"><i>Civil Applications.</i></p>

<p><i>Projects for a line of communication, general plan, and trial
sections.</i>&mdash;The officers are instructed in the general
principles which should guide them in laying out lines of communication,
whether by road, railway, or canal, and are then sent out to examine the
country between two points five or six miles apart, and are required to
decide on two or more routes which apparently offer the greatest
facilities in point of gradients, soil, and the materials of
construction. Availing themselves of the best map or plan they can
obtain, they draw a plan showing approximately the divisions of the
properties through which the trial lines are run; they then make trial
sections; and from these sections and their previous examination of the
ground, they determine on the line, to be adopted, embodying in a report
a general description of the country, the obstacles encountered on each
route, the gradients, curves, etc., and also the calculations which led
to their decision. In their calculations they estimate the cost of the
necessary constructions on each of the trial lines, the cost of
conveyance for heavy goods on an assumed basis of daily traffic, and the
time occupied in each case for quick transit.</p>

<p><i>Working plan and section.</i>&mdash;A length of one mile of the
route determined on as the best is selected, and for this a special
survey is made, which is laid down as a working plan, the line being
picketed out when no objection is made by the owners of the property
through which it passes. A&nbsp;working section of the line is also
prepared from accurate levels.</p>

<p><i>Plan of details, etc.</i>&mdash;For the works proposed on that
portion of the line Which is, included within the limits of the working
section, a plan of details Is prepared, as well as a specification for
the works and an estimate of their probable cost.</p>


<p class = "smallhead">II. THE COURSE OF CONSTRUCTION AND
ESTIMATING.</p>

<p>For this course 142 days, including Sundays, are allowed. The course
is divided into four parts.</p>


<p class = "heading"><i>Part I&mdash;Theory of Construction.</i></p>

<p>This part consists of a series of examples in construction, about 50
in number, which will be varied from time to time.</p>

<p>They are drawn up with a special view to the application of the
mathematical knowledge already possessed by the officers to some of the
cases, which they are likely to have to deal with in practice.</p>

<p>References are given in the margin of the printed paper of examples
to
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page599" id = "page599">599</a></span>
some of the many books in which the information, necessary for their
solution can he found.</p>

<p>The instructing officer will explain every morning, except Saturday,
as many of the examples as he considers the officers can work during the
remainder of the day, and the officers are expected to study these
subjects from some one of the books referred to.</p>

<p>The object of these short explanations is twofold: 1st, to explain
the principles on which the particular cases or similar cases are to be
dealt with; 2d, to impart in a condensed form some of the varied
information which is familiar to all engineers of experience, but which
an engineer at the commencement of his career often has a difficulty in
finding.</p>

<p>The officers will take notes of these explanations, and write each
morning notes at the head of the fair copy of the examples, to which
they refer. The examples explained on each day are to be worked out on
that day in the fullest manner; the reasoning of each step is to be
stated, and all rough calculations are to be left on the paper, so as to
lessen as much as possible the labor of examination. They are to be
brought to the instructing officer the following morning, and after
examination are to be written out fair on ruled foolscap,
quarter-margin, on the right-hand sheet, with explanatory diagrams to a
large scale, where necessary, on the left-hand sheet.</p>

<p>The fair notes of each week’s work must be sent in before the end of
the following week.</p>

<p>The weights, strength of materials, and other information, will be
found in the printed tables.</p>

<p>This part of the course occupies about 40 days, and while it
continues leave will be granted on Saturdays and Sundays only.</p>


<p class = "heading"><i>Part II.&mdash;Materials.</i></p>

<p>The object of this part of the course is to give the officers some
sort of guide in judging of the quality of the principal materials which
they will have to use, as well as to afford them information as to the
particular material most suitable for a building or engineering
work.</p>

<p>It may be subdivided into three parts, viz., lectures given by
professors in the lecture theatre; lectures given by the instructing
officer; and visits made by the officers to lime works, cement works,
brickfields, etc.</p>

<p>The lectures in the lecture theatre are delivered at the periods most
convenient to the lecturer, but the notes taken by the officers form
part of this course, and will be bound up with the rest of the
papers.</p>

<p>The notes of the lectures delivered by the instructing officer are to
be written out fair immediately after the lecture, in accordance with
the instructions given, and brought to, the instructing officer on the
following morning.</p>

<p>A printed paper detailing the particular points to which officers
visiting manufacturing works are to direct their attention will be given
to each officer, and a report is to be sent in as soon as possible after
each visit to the instructing officer.</p>

<p>Sketches to illustrate the lectures and visits are to be as numerous
and complete as possible.</p>

<p>The value of these sketches for future reference, and as aids to
officers in their professional constructions hereafter, will be very
much enhanced by having the dimensions clearly written on them, which
should include at least those of all principal parts of machines and
structures.</p>

<p>This part of the course occupies about three weeks, inclusive of the
time required to visit the works referred to.</p>

<p>The officers will also be instructed, after they leave the course of
construction, in the method of testing the quality of some of the
materials by chemical analysis, for which a fortnight is allowed.</p>


<p class = "heading"><i>Part III.&mdash;Valuation and Measurement of
Work.</i></p>

<p>This part of the course will occupy in all about 37 days, and will
commence with a series of lectures, the subject matter of which will be
found chiefly in the printed “Notes on the Practice of Building” and
“Notes on the Building Trades.” They will comprise, in separate lectures
for each trade,&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The materials, tools, etc., and apparatus employed, together with
their application to the different kinds of work produced.</p>

<p>2. The technical terms in vogue.</p>

<p>3. The general practice of measuring and valuing.</p>

<p>Hints and memoranda useful in designing, estimating, and carrying out
works will be given, and explanations afforded by reference to models
and
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page600" id = "page600">600</a></span>
drawings, from some of which colored sketches, with the names and
dimensions of the different parts given on them in full, will be made by
each officer and attached to his printed notes. These sketches will be
done in the Hall of Study from the originals deposited there.</p>

<p>A lecture will be given explaining the different steps taken in
preparing the annual estimates of a district, to be laid before
Parliament, and the various methods of carrying out the services which
may be authorized.</p>

<p>The cost of a building will be approximately estimated by cubing it
out from the general plans and elevations.</p>

<p>The quantities of the same building will then be taken out from the
specifications, working drawings, and a model, by filling in a
measurement form having the details of work done printed on it.</p>

<p>Details and estimates of the same building will be made out on W.O.
Form 1554, the items and prices being taken from the W.D. Schedules of
the district, and the descriptive part printed on.</p>

<p>Lastly, the quantities will be abstracted and brought into bill, as
though the work were to be put up to tender, or as would be done in
drawing out contractors’ bills for work to be paid for on a schedule of
prices.</p>

<p>The portions of the copper plates to be colored will be partly done
in the course of lectures, but about a week at the close of this part of
the course will be allowed to complete the whole. They are to be colored
in the Hall of Study from pattern drawings deposited there. No drawing
whatever to be removed from the Hall of Study.</p>


<p class = "heading"><i>Part IV.&mdash;Design.</i></p>

<p>At the commencement of this part of the course each officer will read
through the “Notes on Military Buildings,” by Colonel Collinson, Royal
Engineers, studying more particularly the parts which have special
reference to his own design. The lithographed drawings which accompany
them are not intended to be models to be copied from, but are given as
examples of works executed, many of which with the advance of sanitary
science have become obsolete as a whole. They contain many useful
details still applicable.</p>

<p>The design is intended to afford to each officer an opportunity of
applying the knowledge he may have acquired in the course to some case
which he may actually hereafter have to deal with.</p>

<p>About six weeks are available for this part of the course, and the
conditions under which the design is to be made will be furnished to
each officer.</p>

<p>As a rule the design will consist of a general plan and report, with
some part worked out in detail, this part being specified for and
estimated.</p>

<p>The drawings are to be prepared in accordance with the instructions
deposited in the Hall of Study.</p>


<p class = "heading"><i>Tour Reports and Lectures.</i></p>

<p>All tour reports and lectures pertaining to the course of
construction will be written in accordance with the general regulations
for reports, that is to say, on foolscap paper, quarter margin, on both
sides of the paper, divided into paragraphs, with headings in the
margin, and signed and dated by the officer. They will form part of Part
II. of the course, and will be bound in the proper places.</p>

<p>In writing tour reports and lectures the object should be to condense
as much practical information and fact into as small a space as possible
without abbreviating the language or omitting any of the facts. Sketches
should be made by hand, approximately to scale, but should be clear, and
contain full dimensions. Statistical and tabular information should be
given in full.</p>

<p>For the tour report each officer will receive a statement of the
particulars of each work he has to report on.</p>


<p class = "heading"><i>Binding.</i></p>

<p>The whole of the notes, etc., of each officer will be bound in one or
more volumes. Therefore, before leaving the establishment, each officer
should arrange his notes in the order in which he wishes them bound.</p>


<p class = "smallhead">III.&mdash;FIELD WORK COURSE.</p>

<p>The time allowed for this course is 122 days, including Sundays.
While on it officers may be required to attend drill one day in each
week, and also brigade field days.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page601" id = "page601">601</a></span>
<p>The course comprises instruction in all those duties (with the
exceptions mentioned below) which devolve upon the Royal Engineers when
employed with an army engaged offensively or defensively, either at a
siege or in the field.</p>

<p>The exceptions are surveying, reconnaissance, telegraphy, firing
mines by electricity, etc., torpedoes, and demolition of permanent
works; on all which subjects instruction is given to the officers while
on other courses.</p>

<p>The officers are required to read carefully the notes on field work
instruction, to make models in sand, etc., of such works as admit of
this practice, to take part in the construction of the several works in
the field, etc., and to draw up projects on the subject.</p>

<p>Before leaving the course an officer must be competent to impart
instruction to sappers in all their field duties.</p>

<p>The practical instruction is divided into seven parts.</p>


<p class = "heading"><i>Part I.&mdash;Modelling in Sand, etc.</i></p>

<p>This part consists of making models of gabions, fascines, hurdles,
and sap-rollers; of throwing up models in sand of portions of a first
parallel and its approaches, of a second parallel, of single and double
saps, both kneeling and standing, of a trench cavalier, of a lodgment by
half double sap, of rifle-pits, and of trons-de-loup.</p>

<p>Also of making models in sand of field powder magazines, and of
elevated, sunken, half sunken, and screen, gun and mortar batteries
(ordinary and indented), revetted with gabions, fascines, and sand
bags.</p>

<p>It includes the laying of model gun and mortar platforms, the making
of a salient of a field redoubt, with gun en barbette, of a field
kitchen, and of the passage of a wet ditch by means of gabions and
fascines.</p>

<p>Also the erection of spar bridges of different forms with model
spars, and the laying in of a cross-over road to connect two lines of
railway.</p>


<p class = "heading"><i>Part II.&mdash;Siege Works.</i></p>

<p>This part consists of making gabions, fascines, hurdles, and
sap-rollers; of tracing (part by night) parallels, approaches,
batteries, etc.</p>

<p>Also of seeing parallels, approaches, batteries, saps, trench
cavaliers, etc., constructed by the sappers; and the mode of extending
men and setting them to work.</p>

<p>The officers are also required to take up for enfilade the
prolongation of faces, etc.</p>


<p class = "heading"><i>Part III&mdash;Works of Defence.</i></p>

<p>This part consists of instruction in forming abattis, entanglements,
rifle pits, trons-de-loup, etc., and in putting up stockades, palisades,
fraises, etc.</p>


<p class = "heading"><i>Part IV.&mdash;Mining.</i></p>

<p>This part includes boring and blasting rock, sinking shafts, driving
galleries, making chambers and powder hose, loading, tamping, and firing
mines, also the preparation and firing of fougasses.</p>


<p class = "heading"><i>Part V.&mdash;Bridging.</i></p>

reëstablish a communication by turnpike road or railroad.</p>


<p class = "heading"><i>Part VI.&mdash;Railways.</i></p>

<p>This part consists in seeing the mode of laying down and repairing
lines of railway, and of putting in a cross-over road to connect two
lines of railway, and also the mode of destroying railways.</p>


<p class = "heading"><i>Part VII.&mdash;Sundry Practices.</i></p>

<p>Under this head are included boring for water (with the American tube
wells as well as with the ordinary apparatus), erecting field kitchens,
filling and throwing hand grenades, and escalading, also the erection of
field observatories.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page602" id = "page602">602</a></span>
<p>The officers are, in addition, required to draw up the following
projects:</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>1. Project of attack of a fortress actually in existence.</p>
<p>2. Project for the restoration of a bridge.</p>
<p>3. Project for a floating bridge.</p>
<p>4. Project for a field work as a bridge-head.</p>
<p>5. Hasty project for a temporary bridge, or hasty project for the
demolition of a portion of a line of railway.</p>
</div>


<p class = "smallhead">IV.&mdash;MISCELLANEOUS SUBJECTS.</p>

<p class = "heading">(<i>a.</i>) <i>Course of Telegraphy.&mdash;Fifteen
days are allowed for this course</i>.</p>

<p>All officers under instruction learn the theory and practice of
telegraphy and visual signalling, bearing in mind that a thorough
knowledge of the theory will enable them to overcome difficulties which
would be perplexing to the men, who can only be expected to learn the
practical working of the telegraph.</p>

<p>The various instruments in use for signalling and testing are
explained to them, and they are taught the ordinary methods of measuring
electrical forces and resistances, and of testing conducting wires for
insulation and conductivity, and for determining the nature and
positions of faults. The degree of accuracy which may be attained in
these measurements is pointed out to them.</p>

<p>They learn the European Morse alphabet, and the method of sending and
receiving messages, but they are not expected to devote so much time to
the subject as would enable them to become expert telegraphists.</p>

<p>Each officer is required to give in a project for the construction of
a line of electric telegraph, including at least three stations. In the
report are described the instruments to be used and the modes of
connecting them in circuit; the batteries, the conductors, the supports,
the insulators, and the mode of putting up the line; and the number of
cells required to work the line is calculated.</p>

<p>An estimate of the stores and materials required accompanies the
report, with a general plan showing the route proposed.</p>

<p>The various methods of exploding gunpowder by electricity are taught
while the course of telegraphy is going on; the application of this
branch of electrical science is made when the officers are employed on
projects for demolitions by mining.</p>

<p>In the School of Telegraphy a certain number of the men of the corps
are trained every year as telegraphists.</p>

<p>The instruments of which the use is taught are.&mdash;</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>The single needle instrument worked by voltaic electricity.</p>
<p>The Morse recording and sounding instrument.</p>
<p>The double needle instrument.</p>
<p>Wheatstone’s magneto dial instrument.</p>
<p>Also day and night signalling with the approved visual apparatus.</p>
</div>

<p>Each man is required to read a specified number of words per minute,
and to send correctly by each instrument, before he passes on to the
next.</p>

<p>The European Morse alphabet is used with all the instruments, except
with the double needle instrument, which has a special alphabet.</p>

<p>The men are taught how to make up and repair the voltaic batteries
and instruments, and to put up conducting wires over ground, and to lay
them <ins class = "correction"
title = "text has ‘undergound’">underground</ins>, and also to test roughly for the
position of faults. Their previous education does not generally admit of
their acquiring a knowledge of the theory of electricity, or of
performing the more delicate tests required in telegraphy.</p>

<p>The men who enter the Telegraph School are also instructed in the
practical manipulation of Grove’s voltaic batteries, Wheatstone’s
magnetic exploder, and the dynamo-electric machine, in the use of
frictional electricity, in making the electrical fuzes, and in
connecting and arranging the wires necessary for firing mines by
electricity.</p>

<p class = "heading">(<i>b.</i>) <i>Chemical Laboratory
Course.&mdash;Fifteen days are allowed for this course</i>.</p>

<p>The object of this course is to enable officers and men at the
establishment, who may show an inclination for chemical studies, to
pursue them practically.</p>

<p>The course is confined to the chemical relations and behavior of the
substances which affect the qualities of building materials, or which
may influence the questions which are most likely to require the
professional investigation of a military engineer. It is arranged with
the idea of supplying the
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page603" id = "page603">603</a></span>
want of practical experience in dealing with substances used in
construction, by giving an insight into their nature and composition;
and also with that of imparting such information as may lead in a new
colony, should an officer be called upon to act as its explorer and
pioneer, to a more rapid development of its resources.</p>

<p>The course for the officers consists,&mdash;</p>

<p>1st. In making themselves acquainted with the action of reagents,
both by wet methods and by the blow-pipe, on different simple
substances, in experiments to which they are directed by a
text-book.</p>

<p>2d. In applying the information so gained to the qualitative
examination of substances, simple and compound, specially prepared as
exercises for analysis.</p>

<p>3d. In the quantitative as well as qualitative examination of
building stones, lime and cement stones, gypsum, brick earths, paints,
solders, and other building materials. A&nbsp;sample of water is also
examined, and a qualitative examination is made of one or more ores.</p>

<p>4th. In preparing, on an experimental scale, bricks, limes, cements,
and plasters, directly from natural stones or earths by simple
calcination, and also by the more complex method which it is often
necessary to adopt.</p>

<p>5th. The chemistry of the voltaic battery.</p>

<p>The course for the men only differs from that for the officers in
respect of the order in which the several divisions of the subject are
taken up. The men, instead of commencing with a thorough examination of
numerous simple substances, begin with a few easy experiments on
recognizing lime and cement stones, and on the mode of ascertaining
their comparative values, so that, in case it is judged inexpedient, in
any instance, that the whole course shall be completed, the knowledge
which has been gained may be of a character requiring comparatively
little skill and intelligence to apply to practical uses.</p>

<p>A certain number of men only are taught.</p>

<p class = "heading">(<i>c.</i>) <i>Course of Photography.</i></p>

<p>This study is not compulsory; but any officer and a limited number of
men who have completed the prescribed course satisfactorily, and who
wish to study photography, are allowed to do so.</p>

<p>The officers devote their attention more particularly to the chemical
theory of the subject, in order that they may be able to overcome the
practical difficulties which constantly occur when this art is pursued
in foreign countries under circumstances of climate and situation
different from those in England, and when chemicals get out of order and
produce anomalous results. In such cases men who have acquired
considerable skill in manipulation, but who have no knowledge of
chemistry, are unable to devise remedies or to overcome difficulties,
and it is the place of their officers to assist them by their superior
knowledge and intelligence.</p>

<p>The men are taught the negative wet collodion process in all its
branches (except the manufacture of pyroxyline), also the dry process,
and photozincography.</p>

<p>They are also practised in the use of the dark tent, and in taking
negatives in the field, and of photographic reductions of plans.</p>

<p>It is seldom that their previous education admits of their becoming
well versed in the chemical theory of the art, but the means of
overcoming the usual practical difficulties are pointed out to them.
Each man is required to enter in a note-book the various solutions, and
to make memoranda of the processes.</p>

<p class = "heading">(<i>d.</i>) <i>Lectures.</i></p>

<p>Lectures are delivered between the months of September and April on
civil and mechanical engineering, metallurgy, architecture, electricity
and its applications, and on other subjects of a professional character.
The lectures are attended by all the officers and men under instruction,
and the former are required to take rough notes, and afterward to write
them out fairly, for binding with their other work.</p>

<p class = "heading">(<i>e.</i>) <i>Visits to Professional
Works.</i></p>

<p>With the object of giving an idea of the best methods of carrying on
extensive works, and of imparting practical information on professional
subjects, a certain number of the junior officers are selected every
year to visit
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page604" id = "page604">604</a></span>
engineering, architectural, and other works of professional character,
accompanied by one of the instructing officers of the establishment.</p>

<p>Of the various constructions and processes seen during these tours
they make notes and drawings, which are embodied in the form of reports
to the director, and are subsequently bound up with the other parts of
the course.</p>

<p><i>General Note.</i>&mdash;Further explanations of the mode of
filling up the details of the course, and of the forms for the notes and
drawings, are given in the special instructions.</p>

<p class = "heading">(<i>f.</i>) <i>Demolitions.</i></p>

<p>The ignition of gunpowder or other explosives by powder hose and
Bickford’s fuze as well as by electricity, both on land and submerged
under water, is taught to all officers.</p>

<p>In order that the best methods of using gunpowder or other explosives
for the demolition of works and buildings by mining may be thoroughly
understood, each officer is required to make projects for the following
demolitions, viz.:</p>

<p>1. A front of fortification, or some similar work, exhibiting various
sorts of revetments, and requiring the simultaneous explosion of a large
number of mines.</p>

<p>2. A casemate, powder magazine, or other substantial military
building under two suppositions: 1st, that there is plenty of time, that
sufficient men and tools are available, and that it is required to
effect complete demolition without wasting gunpowder unnecessarily; 2d,
that time presses, and that the demolition must be effected in the most
expeditious manner possible.</p>

<p>3. A bridge or viaduct under two different suppositions, as in No.
2.</p>

<p>The mines in some cases are directed to be tired by powder hose, and
in others by electricity.</p>

<p>Each of these projects consists of a memoir and explanatory drawings.
The memoir comprises,&mdash;</p>

<p>1st. A description of the building, or work to be destroyed, in all
points which may influence the mode of demolition.</p>

<p>2d. A general description of the proposed mode of demolition.</p>

<p>3d. The calculations for the charges of the mines.</p>

<p>4th. The mode of preparing and firing the mines.</p>

<p>5th. An estimate of the men, tools, and materials required and of the
time necessary for the operation.</p>

<p>6th. An estimate of the gunpowder.</p>

<p>7th. When electricity is to be employed for firing the mines, a full
description of the batteries, etc., is given, with calculations of the
number of cells, etc.</p>

<p>The drawings include a plan and such sections as may be required to
explain clearly the situations of the various charges of gunpowder, and
of the shafts and galleries.</p>

<p class = "heading">(<i>g.</i>) <i>Submarine Mines.</i></p>

<p>All officers and a certain number of men are practised in the use of
submarine mines.</p>

<p>The course consists of,&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The nature and construction of case.</p>

<p>2. Mode of mooring.</p>

<p>3. Mode of arranging and laying insulated cables.</p>

<p>4. Mode of testing fuzes, also testing cables for conductivity and
insulation and for the detection of faults.</p>

<p>5. Modes of firing at will and by self-acting arrangements.</p>

<p><span class = "firstword">Although</span> examinations preparatory to
promotion had been instituted by the Duke of Wellington in 1850, no
attempt was made to provide any general machinery for affording to
officers of the army means of instruction, even in those subjects a
knowledge of which was by the regulations of the service required of
them. The Department of Artillery studies at Woolwich, originally
instituted on a small scale in 1850, and the Royal Engineer
Establishment at Chatham, supplied to the officers of the scientific
corps, though to a much more limited extent than at the present day,
opportunities of carrying on their professional studies after entering
the army. But to officers of other branches of the service no means of
instruction were afforded in any subjects beyond the mere routine of
drill and regimental duties, except by the Senior Department at
Sandhurst and the School of Musketry at Hythe. The state of the former
institution, the advantages of which extended only to a very small
proportion of the officers of the army, is described in the accounts of
the Royal Military College and of the Staff College. The school at Hythe
was first established in the year 1853, for the purpose of training a
certain number of officers and soldiers in the new system of musketry,
which was adopted on the introduction of rifled arms into the
service.</p>

<p>The first official suggestion, with the object of remedying the
deficiency of professional knowledge among the officers of the army, was
made by Mr. Sidney Herbert, when Secretary at War, in 1854. The outline
of the plan proposed by him at this time was sketched out in a letter
addressed to Lord Hardinge, then Commander-in-Chief, and its details
were subsequently more fully explained in speeches in the House of
Commons. The scheme contemplated a general reorganization of the system
of military education,&mdash;the improvement
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page606" id = "page606">606</a></span>
of the examinations instituted by the Duke of Wellington for admission
to the army and for promotion,&mdash;the conversion of the Senior
Department at Sandhurst into a special school for the staff,&mdash;and
the introduction of a system of professional instruction for officers
after entering the service. With the view of carrying out the latter
part of the scheme, it was proposed, in 1854, to appoint garrison
instructors at certain large stations both at home and in the colonies.
It was not intended to make attendance at the instruction thus given
compulsory, but a stringent examination in the subjects which entered
into the course was to be a necessary condition of promotion to the
ranks of lieutenant and captain respectively.</p>

<p>The scheme of garrison instruction proposed by Mr. Sidney Herbert met
with the approval of Lord Hardinge, and obtained the sanction of the
Treasury. A&nbsp;sum of 2,000<i>l.</i>, for the purpose of making a
commencement in carrying it out, was inserted in the estimates for
1854-5, and the plan, as explained by Mr. Herbert in moving the army
estimates, met with the entire approval of the House of Commons.</p>

<p>The outbreak of the Crimean War, however, in the first instance,
interfered with the practical realization of the scheme, although it
appears that some of the instructors had been actually selected for
their posts, and that it was intended to send them out to the Crimea to
acquire a practical acquaintance with such of the minor operations of
war as would fall within the intended course of instruction. This latter
intention was not carried out, and after the resignation of Mr. Sidney
Herbert, which took place in the beginning of 1855, no further steps
appear to have been taken in the matter. At the same time money
continued to be voted for the purpose of carrying out the scheme
(although no application of the funds was made), until the general
reduction in the estimates which took place on the conclusion of peace
in 1856; it appears also, from statements made by the Under Secretary at
War, in the House of Commons, that the Government had never abandoned
the idea of adopting some measure for the professional instruction of
officers.</p>

<p>In the debates in both Houses of Parliament, during the Crimean War,
numerous discussions took place on the subject of military education;
the failure of the existing examinations for promotion, the lax mode in
which they were carried out,
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page607" id = "page607">607</a></span>
the want of acquaintance with many of the mere rudiments of military
science displayed by the majority of officers, and the necessity of
supplying them with some means of instruction in the practical duties
devolving upon them on active service, formed frequent subjects of
remark. On the 5th of June, 1856, after the termination of the war, Mr.
Sidney Herbert, then a private member, again brought his proposal for
the appointment of garrison instructors before the notice of the House
of Commons, in connection with his more general scheme for the
improvement of the education of officers; but, although the proposal
again met with the approval of nearly every speaker who took part in the
discussion, the Government declined to pledge themselves to the adoption
of the scheme in its details, as the question of the reorganization of
the whole system of military education was then under consideration.</p>

<p>During the latter part of the year 1856, as has been elsewhere
stated, the attention of the military authorities was seriously directed
to the question of improving the education of the army. Nearly all the
plans submitted to Lord Panmure with this object included, as an
essential feature, the adoption of some means of professional
instruction for officers after entering the service; and the machinery
suggested was, in almost every case, based in its general principles on
Mr. Sidney Herbert’s original proposal for the establishment of garrison
instructors. The Commissioners appointed in the same year to visit the
military schools of the continent, while their inquiries were chiefly
confined to the improvement of the education of the scientific corps,
recommended in their report that young officers of all branches of the
service should, after entering the army, go through some course of
professional study; at the same time they suggested no machinery for
carrying their recommendation into effect. The military witnesses
examined, during the years 1856 and 1857, before the Royal Commission on
the Purchase System, very generally concurred in the opinion that higher
professional acquirements should be demanded from officers, and that
means of instruction should be afforded to them; and the Commissioners,
in their Report, endorsed this view in the following terms: “Nor can it
be fairly said that the purchase system is the obstacle to introducing a
better system of military education.
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page608" id = "page608">608</a></span>
A stricter examination before granting the first commission, an improved
training afterward, and a further examination on promotion from ensign
to lieutenant, are measures perfectly compatible with the system of
purchase.”</p>

<p>The system of garrison instruction suggested by Mr. Sidney Herbert
appears to have found general favor at this period. The instructions
issued to the Council of Military Education, on their appointment in
1857, directed them, in connection with the subject of the professional
examination of officers up to the rank of captain, to consider the
question “of the establishment of instructors at the large stations.”
The plan proposed by the Council, in 1857, did not contemplate the
general appointment of either garrison or regimental instructors; its
main feature was the establishment of officers’ schools at depot
battalion stations, through which all young officers, who were in the
first instance to receive provisional commissions, should pass before
joining their regiments and being permanently commissioned. This
recommendation was supplemented by one for the partial establishment of
district instructors at stations where classes of ten officers could be
formed, for the more advanced instruction of those who had been some
years in the service.</p>

<p>The great demand for officers occasioned by the Indian mutiny,
combined with practical objections which were made to the Council’s
scheme, prevented their proposals from being carried into effect. The
only immediate result of their recommendations was the establishment, in
1857, of a class at Aldershot for the instruction of officers quartered
at the camp in military sketching. A&nbsp;full account of this
institution, which has since been considerably developed, and is now
called the Survey Class, will be found further on.</p>

<p>At a subsequent period the attention of the Council appears to have
been directed more to the question of securing the professional
competence of officers by a special military education before entering
the service, than by compulsory instruction at a later period. The
proposal, originally made in 1858, for requiring all candidates for
commissions in the line to pass through Sandhurst, has been already
described in connection with the Royal Military College. The Council
have, however, never ceased to urge the expediency of providing
officers, after they have entered the service, with facilities for
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page609" id = "page609">609</a></span>
instruction in the higher branches of military science; and in their
last General Report they recommended the establishment of institutions
similar to the Aldershot Survey Class at other large stations.</p>

<p>Although no general machinery has been introduced for affording
instruction to officers of the cavalry and infantry after entering the
service, various steps have, from time to time, been taken with the
object of extending their professional knowledge to subjects beyond the
mere routine duties of their own arms. In January, 1859, commanding
officers were directed to require from the officers of their regiments
reports and, if possible, sketches of the roads traversed when route
marching in winter; and later in the same year an order was issued that
officers of infantry should, whenever practicable, be instructed in
great gun drill. In the present year a system of instruction in military
signalling has been introduced at the School of Engineering at Chatham,
to which detachments of officers are periodically sent. In addition to
the recommendations of the present Royal Commission for the introduction
of a system of garrison and regimental instruction, the Royal Commission
on Courts-martial, in their recent Report, recommended that more
attention should be paid to the education of officers in military law,
and that stricter examinations in the subject should be enforced.</p>

<p>The necessity of an improvement in the professional acquirements of
officers appears to have been almost universally recognized from the
time when Mr. Sidney Herbert brought the subject to public notice in
1854. Various opinions, however, have been entertained as to the means
by which the desired object could best be effected.</p>

<p>The different plans which have from time to time been suggested may
be classified under two main divisions:</p>

<p>(1.) Those which propose a special military education for all
candidates for commissions before entering the service.</p>

<p>(2.) Those which advocate, in preference, the postponement of
professional instruction, at least for the majority of the officers of
the army, until a later period, after the service has been entered, and
the rank of officer been attained.</p>

<p>Under the former head comes the scheme suggested by the Council of
Military Education in 1858, the adoption of which was at one time
determined upon by the military authorities,
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page610" id = "page610">610</a></span>
for requiring all candidates for commissions in the cavalry and infantry
to pass through Sandhurst. A&nbsp;similar proposal was suggested by
witnesses to the Royal Commission on the Purchase System in 1856; it was
supported by the authority of the Duke of Cambridge and Mr. Sidney
Herbert (who had originally been opposed to&nbsp;it) before the Select
Committee of the House of Commons on Military Organization, in 1860; and
the Committee, in their Report, though declining to pronounce any
decided opinion on the subject, stated that they considered the measure
“well worthy of the most careful consideration.” Of late years the same
principle has been publicly advocated by Sir C. Trevelyan, who considers
that there should be but two modes of admission to the rank of
officer,&mdash;one through a military college, and the other by serving
in the ranks; and the advantages which would result from passing all
candidates for commissions through a military college have been urged by
several witnesses, including His Royal Highness the Duke of Cambridge,
before the present Royal Commission. On the other hand, opponents of
this view have pointed out the objections entertained by them to any
such measure.</p>

<p>Allied to the plan for making a military college the sole channel of
admission to the commissioned ranks of the army is one for requiring all
candidates for commissions to serve as cadets, in order to acquire a
practical acquaintance with their duties, before obtaining the rank of
officer. This proposal, originally suggested by Lord Clyde, before the
Royal Commission on the Purchase System, has more recently been
supported by the authority of Sir W. Mansfield and Lord De la Warr; the
latter officer, however, appears of late to have somewhat modified his
views, and to advocate at present, for all young men who obtain direct
commissions by purchase, a probationary course of six or twelve months’
instruction in military subjects and drill, at their parents’ expense,
prior to joining their regiments, in accordance with a plan submitted to
the Commission. The cadet system has also been advocated by Lord Walden
before the Commission.</p>

<p>To the class of plans which advocate the postponement of professional
instruction for the majority of the officers of the army until after the
service has been entered, belong Mr. Sidney Herbert’s original proposal,
in 1854, for the introduction of a system of garrison
instruction&mdash;the recommendation
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page611" id = "page611">611</a></span>
of the Commissioners of 1856 “that young officers after entering the
army should go through some course of professional study,”&mdash;the
suggestion made by the Royal Commission on the Purchase System for “an
improved system of training after the first commission is
granted,”&mdash;and the proposal of the Council of Military Education,
in 1857, for the establishment of depot battalion schools for young
officers. Opinions founded on the same principle have been expressed by
several witnesses before the present Commission. The system of garrison
instructors at large stations, that of regimental instructors in each
corps, and, lastly, a combination of both systems, have been
respectively advocated by various authorities as the machinery by which
the later instruction of officers should be carried out. Even those who
advocate a special education at a military college as the universal
condition of obtaining a commission do not, in the majority of cases,
contemplate the cessation of all instruction on the commission being
obtained; at the same time in many instances they do not consider that
this later instruction should be made compulsory on officers, and, while
recommending that facilities should be afforded for it, they maintain
the superior efficacy of a system of preliminary military education at
an earlier age.</p>


<h5><a name = "britain_officers_aldershot" id =
"britain_officers_aldershot" href = "#britain_officers">I. SURVEY CLASS
AT ALDERSHOT.</a></h5>

<p>The survey class at Aldershot originated in an order of the
Quartermaster-General in 1857, appointing two extra deputy-assistants to
afford professional instruction to officers of the division stationed
there in military sketching and surveying, field and permanent
fortification, and photography.</p>

<p>These courses and conditions of attendance are as follows:</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>1. An elementary course comprises practical geometry, so far as is
necessary for the understanding of the principles of surveying and
fortification, plan drawing, the construction and use of scales, and
military sketching.</p>

<p>The other course embraces surveying in its more advanced branches,
military reconnaissances and road reports, field fortification,
including the attack and defence of small posts, the construction of
simple intrenchments, redoubts, and field works, profiling and tracing
on the ground, gabion and fascine making, camping, and the construction
of field ovens and cook-houses.</p>

<p>2. Officers will not be allowed to go through the course of
instruction unless their commanding officer will certify that they are
intelligent, zealous, and well conducted; but considering that the stay
of regiments at this camp is frequently limited, the Lieutenant-General
Commanding would wish that every facility should be given to officers to
avail themselves of the instruction, even though they may not be
thoroughly acquainted, with all their duties.</p>

<p>3. Every officer wishing to attend the course of instruction will
submit his application to his commanding officer, who will forward it
with his recommendation and the certificate mentioned in the last
paragraph, or with such remarks as he may have to offer, should he
consider it his duty not to recommend the application.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page612" id = "page612">612</a></span>
<p>4. Officers going through the elementary course will be struck off
all duty for two months (Sundays excepted). They will go on flying
columns.</p>

<p>5. Officers anxious to attend the second course will be allowed to do
so for four months, during which time they will take all regimental
duties which would entail extra work on the other officers, but will be
excused all brigade and divisional duties, except those mentioned in
paragraph 7.</p>

<p>6. Officers permitted to attend are not to absent themselves without
leave from the Lieutenant-General commanding.</p>

<p>7. Officers are to be present at divisional field days, and when the
division marches into the country during the winter months, either with
the deputy assistants quartermaster-general sketching the ground, noting
the movements, preparing reports, etc. (in&nbsp;undress, without
swords), or if not so employed they are to fall in with their respective
corps.</p>

<p>8. The number of officers attending is restricted to two per
regiment.</p>

<p>9. The instruction will extend from 10 <span class =
"smallroman">A.M.</span> till 1 <span class = "smallroman">P.M.</span>,
excepting on Saturdays, when all the officers will attend till 12
only.</p>

<p>10. Staff officers who may wish to avail themselves of the
instruction given at the Survey Office, or in the field, may attend at
such hours as the nature of the duties they have to perform will
admit.</p>

<p>11. Officers of the division generally will be assisted by the
D.A.Q.M.G.s as far as practicable, in pursuing their studies in other
branches.</p>

<p>12. A diary will be kept showing the names of all officers attending,
the hours of attendance, the work done, etc.; this diary is to be
submitted for the inspection of the Lieutenant-General commanding, and
from it a monthly report will be prepared for the information of the
Field Marshal.</p>

<p>13. Officers will be allowed the use of surveying instruments but
will have to provide their own drawing and other materials. They will,
however, be permitted to retain all sketches, plans, and reports thus
made on their own materials, after they have been returned from the
Council.</p>
</div>

<p>The course actually carried out in 1868-69 was as follows:</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>Explanation, use, and construction of scales&mdash;several examples
worked and a plate of scales drawn&mdash;mode of using the usual drawing
instruments, protractors, and Marquois’ scales.</p>

<p>Use of the prismatic compass&mdash;a road is traversed with the
compass&mdash;bearings and measurements entered in a field-book, and the
result plotted indoors on a large scale.</p>

<p>A plate of the conventional signs used by the topographical
department, and a set of the seven examples of shading ground
(by&nbsp;the late Major Petley), according to the latest scale of shade,
are given to each officer to copy.</p>

<p>The general principles of plan drawing, and the mode of conducting a
survey by means of measuring a base, and by a triangulation, are
explained, and a flat piece of ground is sketched with the compass, and
plotted in the field.</p>

<p>The method of representing ground by contours only is now explained
and illustrated by models, drawings, etc., and it is shown how from a
contoured plan sections and elevations of ground are made, also how by
adding shade to the contoured plan, a certain pictorial effect is
produced, etc.</p>

<p>Abney’s pocket level and clinometer is explained, and various modes
of rough levelling illustrated.</p>

<p>The method of using the pocket sextant is next shown, and the
officers are taken to a plateau with strongly marked slopes, a base is
measured, triangulation made by means of the sextant; and the artificial
features filled in.</p>

<p>Contours at 25 feet vertically apart are now sketched in chain dotted
lines, and several sectional lines taken by means of the level,
clinometer, compass, and a scale of hypothenuses, and the various angles
of inclination written on the sketch. The scale of shade is explained,
and the officers taught how to apply it to the sketch of ground so
contoured, and the sketch finished up as directed in the memorandum by
the Council of Military Education.</p>

<p>Major-General Napier’s pamphlet on reconnaissance is given to each
officer, and four or five miles of road reconnoitred, sketched, and
reported on.</p>

FOR ARTILLERY OFFICERS AT WOOLWICH.</a></h5>

<p>The necessity of more advanced attainments both in the science and
practice of gunnery was pointed out by the Commissioners in 1856, but
nothing was done till Colonel Lefroy urged the matter on the Council of
Military Education in 1862, and in November, 1863, regulations were
issued for the establishment of Advanced Classes of Artillery Officers
at Woolwich.</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>A Director of Artillery Studies was first appointed in 1850, upon the
recommendation of Field-Marshal Sir Hew Ross, G.C.B., R.A. (then
Adjutant-General of Artillery). His duties were to take charge of and
direct the studies of the young officers of artillery on first joining
at Woolwich, to assist them in their professional pursuits, and read
with them military law, military history, treatises on artillery,
fortification, etc.</p>

<p>The appointment was made provisionally in the first instance, but
confirmed before the close of a year. In April, 1853, the department was
increased by the addition of French and German masters, who, besides
assisting the young officers, were called upon to afford instruction in
their respective languages to officers of artillery of all ranks who
might be desirous of profiting by it.</p>

<p>An allowance of 300<i>l.</i> per annum was also made to enable a
proportion of the more intelligent of the young officers to accompany
the Director in visits to arsenals and fortresses abroad and
manufacturing districts at home.</p>

<p>In July, 1855, the Director of Artillery Studies was allowed the
following assistants: 2 Captains of Artillery, 1 Instructor in
Surveying, 1 Instructor in Military Drawing, etc., 1 Lecturer on Natural
Philosophy and Mechanics, 3 Non-commissioned officers, for the purpose
of giving instruction to certain gentlemen provisionally commissioned
from public colleges or schools after a competitive examination, but
without passing through the Academy.</p>

<p>The Director was expected to advise and assist the efforts of
officers of the Royal Artillery in improving their professional
qualifications, and to arrange classes of officers for instruction in
chemistry, photography, drawing, French, and German, at the Royal
Artillery Institution. He was to inform himself of all the more
interesting experiments under the Ordnance Select Committee, as well as
the operations and processes carried on in the Government manufacturing
departments. He was to arrange and conduct the annual military tour on
the continent; and direct the studies of young officers.</p>

<p>Upon the formation of the Advanced Class in 1864, the staff was
greatly increased, and an Assistant Director appointed, to take charge
in the absence of the Director; to give instruction to classes of
officers of the regiment sent to Woolwich from time to time, to officers
from the Staff College, and to Militia and Volunteer artillery officers;
to prepare questions for the examination of subaltern officers Royal
Artillery for promotion, and report on the results of such examinations;
to attend on foreigners of distinction, and other duties performed by
the Director prior to the formation of the Advanced Class.</p>

href = "#britain_officers">III. SCHOOL OF GUNNERY AT
SHOEBURYNESS.</a></h5>

<p><span class = "firstword">Shoeburyness</span> first became a station
for artillery practice in the year 1849. The practice was, however, at
that time confined to experiments, which were conducted on a very
limited scale, under the department of the Director-General of
Artillery. A battery was constructed and some wooden huts erected at the
station in that year; but for several years nothing but experimental
practice was carried on by batteries of artillery who were sent to
Shoeburyness merely for the summer months, and were quartered, at least
partially, under canvas. No permanent staff were employed, the senior
officer present with the troops being in command of the station. In 1854
the establishment assumed a more permanent character, and was placed
under a lieutenant-colonel of artillery as commandant, who was also at
the same time superintendent of experiments. It still, however,
continued to be merely a station for artillery practice and experiments,
until 1859.</p>

<p>The objects for which the School of Gunnery was established are to
ensure a completeness and uniformity in the instruction of the officers
and men of the Royal Artillery in the use of the weapons and military
machines they are called upon to use; impart to them a knowledge of the
ammunition, stores, and appliances made use of in the artillery service;
of the effect of shot and shell under various circumstances; and, by
constant practice from guns of every description, to train and educate
from year to year a number of officers and men who would carry with them
to their respective brigades an amount of valuable knowledge and
experience which would become in that way, and in due time, diffused
throughout the Royal Artillery, in the same manner as the gunnery
instruction for the Royal Navy on board the “Excellent,” and the
musketry instruction for the infantry at Hythe have percolated with such
advantage through those services.</p>

<p>On the first of April in each year a class of from 20 to 25 officers
is formed for what is termed a “long course,” embracing a period of 12
months; and a class of about 40 non-commissioned officers, for a similar
course.</p>

<p>These classes are formed into two separate squads, and entirely
occupy the time of the chief instructor, one gunnery instructor, and
four assistant instructors. They are instructed
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page617" id = "page617">617</a></span>
in the drills and exercises of every species of ordnance, and the mode
of mounting and dismounting them under various circumstances and with
different means; in transporting the heaviest guns from place to place
and mounting them under difficulties; in making rafts; embarking and
disembarking guns; making up ammunition; preparing demands for stores;
carrying on gun practice with shot, shell, etc.; making signals;
throwing up batteries as at a siege, and afterward testing their
efficiency by firing at them; attending lectures on artillery subjects
by the officers instructing the classes, and on subjects of a scientific
nature, and bearing upon the science of artillery, by professional
gentlemen engaged from time to time for the purpose.</p>

<p>The non-commissioned officers attend these latter lectures, and also
receive from the schoolmaster, under the direction of the officer in
charge of the class (and with great advantage), instruction in
mathematics, and in mechanical drawing applicable to the course they are
being carried through.</p>

<p>In addition to these “long courses,” as they are termed, another
class of 33 non-commissioned officers is sent every three months to go
through what is termed a “short course,” for the purpose of being
instructed in the various duties connected with the service, transport,
etc., of heavy guns.</p>

<p>The result of this system is that an officer and two non-commissioned
officers highly qualified to instruct in all artillery duties and
exercises are sent annually to each brigade; also eight non-commissioned
officers well qualified to assist in the instruction of the
non-commissioned officers and men of their brigades in most duties
connected with heavy ordnance, and with enlarged views of artillery
subjects generally.</p>

<p>Further instruction is imparted to the regiment by sending batteries
from Woolwich, Aldershot, and other contiguous stations, to carry on
their practice, and regimental duty. They take guards and fatigues, move
guns, and otherwise prepare for experiments, and each in its turn goes
through a short course of instruction. The officers and a proportion of
non-commissioned officers of these batteries are formed into a class
under one of the gunnery instructors and his two assistants, and when
they have gone through a preliminary course, one of the batteries, or
more if practicable, are taken off duty for a month, in order to go
through a systematic course, which, though short, is nevertheless highly
valuable.</p>

<p><span class = "firstword">The</span> Senior Department of the
Military College at Sandhurst was constituted in 1808, to enable
officers “to qualify themselves for the Quartermaster-General’s and
Adjutant-General’s departments;” and during the Peninsular war, most of
the officers in these branches of the service were educated there. So
high was its reputation, that the French Staff School was suggested and
modeled after it. From motives of economy, its independent government
and instruction was gradually reduced, and its graduates, no matter how
well qualified, were no longer sure of appointment and promotion, as
against purchase, until, in 1855, it became virtually extinct,&mdash;the
teaching force being reduced to two professors in mathematical studies,
and the number of students to six. In the same year, the French Staff
School, with its thirteen military and five civil professors, and its
range of instruction covering the entire field of practical duties which
belong to an efficient staff officer, was held up as a model. In the
plans and discussions respecting the reorganization and extension of the
educational system of the army, which followed the Crimean war&mdash;in
the Report (1855) of the Select Committee of the House of Commons on
Sandhurst; on the suggestions (1856) of the Commissioners on the
Training of officers for the Scientific Corps; the plan of Mr. Sidney
Herbert, as Secretary of War, in 1854 and 1856; in the instructions of
Lord Panmure, in 1856; in the resolution of the House of Commons, July
28, 1857; in the recommendation of the Royal Commission on the purchase
system, in their Report of 1857; in the plans of the Council of Military
Education, in the same year&mdash;the supreme necessity of a staff
college, with admission by competitive examination, and the assured
encouragement of appointment and
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page620" id = "page620">620</a></span>
promotion on ascertained proficiency and general fitness, was so clearly
demonstrated, that at the close (December&nbsp;17) of 1857, the Senior
Department of Sandhurst was changed to that of a staff college, with a
corps of professors of its own. A separate building was completed for
its accommodation, in 1862; admission was open to officers of all
branches of the service by competitive examination. All appointments to
the Staff were limited to graduates of the College, who had been
attached, for specified periods, to each branch of the service, and to
officers of approved ability in the field.</p>

<p>All officers recommended for staff appointments, who have not proved
their fitness in the field, must pass examinations before a board of
officers and by the Council.</p>


<div class = "in-one">
<p class = "heading"><i>a.&mdash;Aide-de-Camp.</i></p>

<p><i>Regimental Duty.</i>&mdash;The candidate must be prepared in all
the subjects required in the examination for promotion to a troop or
company.</p>

<p><i>Tactics and Field Movements.</i>&mdash;He will be expected to show
a competent knowledge of the tactics and field movements of that branch
of the Service to which he is destined to be attached as a staff
officer, and a general knowledge of those of the other two arms; the
examination will include the movements of a brigade, and will be based
on the regulation books.</p>

<p>On being reported by the Adjutant-General to possess the necessary
professional qualifications, the candidate will be examined by the
Council in</p>

<p><i>English Composition.</i>&mdash;The candidate’s proficiency in this
respect will be tested by his answers to the examination papers.</p>

<p><i>Foreign Languages.</i>&mdash;He will be examined <i>vivâ voce</i>
by the examiner appointed under the Council of Military Education in
whatever language he may select and he will also write a short letter on
a given subject in that language.</p>

<p><i>Military Sketching.</i>&mdash;He will be required to sketch at
least two square miles of ground selected by the Council. The sketch
need not be elaborately finished, but it must clearly and intelligibly
represent the features of ground, which must be determined by means of
the pocket sextant or prismatic compass.</p>

<p><i>Field Fortification.</i>&mdash;He must show a knowledge of the
principles and construction of field works, and must explain the objects
to which they are respectively applicable, as well as the modes of
attacking and defending them.</p>


<p class = "heading"><i>b.&mdash;Brigade Major.</i></p>

<p>A certificate will be required from the commanding officer of the
regiment to which the candidate belongs, or has belonged, that he
possesses all the qualifications of a good adjutant. The examination for
brigade major will be especially directed to the points more immediately
connected with the duties attached to the appointment, as Military Law,
the “Queen’s Regulations and Orders of the Army,” the Royal Warrant for
Pay, Promotion<ins class = "correction"
title = "mismatched quotation mark in original">,”</ins> etc., and, in tactics, all that relates to
alignments, points of formation, distances, etc. The subjects of
examination are the same as in that for the appointment of aide-de-camp,
but the examination will be, throughout, of a higher order.</p>


<p class = "heading"><i>c.&mdash;Deputy Assistant Adjutant-General,
Deputy Assistant Quartermaster-General.</i></p>

<p><i>Military Drawing and Sketching, Judgment of Ground, and its
Occupation by all Arms.</i>&mdash;The candidate will be required to make
a rapid sketch on horseback, with report, of about six square miles of
country; and to select a position which might be occupied by a given
force of the three arms, for some stated object, and to show how he
would dispose the troops for that purpose. He will afterward be required
to make a correct and more finished plan of the position selected, with
the disposition of the troops shown upon it.</p>

<p><i>Practical Geometry and Trigonometry.</i>&mdash;The examination in
these subjects will be limited to determining heights and distances by
ground problems, and the ordinary trigonometrical calculations with the
aid of logarithms.</p>

<p><i>Castrametation.</i>&mdash;The candidate will be expected to know
the mode of encampment for each arm of the Service.</p>

<p><i>Permanent Fortification.</i>&mdash;The theory and construction of
permanent works, as exemplified in Vauban’s or any other system the
candidate may select, as well as the modes of attack and defence
applicable to them.</p>

<p><i>Military History and Geography.</i>&mdash;The candidate will be
expected to give proof that he has carefully studied at least four of
the most memorable modern campaigns, of which the details are best
known, such as those of Marlborough, Frederick the Great, Napoleon, and
Wellington, and in these he must be able to explain the apparent objects
of the various movements and the reasons which he supposes led to their
adoption, and, further, to describe the military geography of the seat
of war.</p>

<p><i>Foreign Languages and Professional Subjects.</i>&mdash;In
languages before the Council of Military Education, as well as in
professional subjects before the Board of Officers, the examination will
be of a higher order than those in (<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>).</p>

<p>The examination for Assistant Adjutant-General and Assistant
Quartermaster-General will, throughout, be of a higher order.</p>

<p><span class = "firstword">The</span> first School of Musketry was
established in June, 1853, and was composed of detachments from
regiments in the neighborhood, viz.: a sergeant, a corporal, and eight
rank and file, from the first, second, and third battalion of the
Grenadier Guards, Coldstream Guards, Scots Fusileer Guards, Rifle
Brigade, etc., to the number of eleven sergeants, eleven corporals, and
eighty-eight rank and file. In 1855, a permanent corps of instructors of
musketry was organized, and in 1861 a second school was instituted at
Fleetwood, which was discontinued in 1867, as one establishment was
found sufficient for training an adequate number of officers of the
regular army, and a due proportion of officers and sergeants of militia
and the Rifle Volunteer Corps.</p>

<p>In connection with the establishment at Hythe, district inspectors
are appointed to superintend the general system of musketry instruction
throughout the army, viz., three in Great Britain, two in Ireland, five
in the colonies, and ten in India.</p>

<p>The instruction embraces not only the practical use of fire-arms, but
the details of construction, both of the weapon and ammunition, the
theory of projectiles, and the comparative value of different arms for
different services.</p>

<p>The staff of the School of Musketry at Hythe consists of 1 Commandant
and Inspector-General of Musketry Instruction; 1 Deputy Assistant
Adjutant-General; 1 Chief Instructor; 2 Captain Instructors; 1
Paymaster; 1 Quartermaster and Acting Adjutant; 1 Surgeon.</p>

<p>In addition to the preparatory and professional schools for officers
of the British Army, already described, there are other public
institutions of a military character and for the military service, which
will be briefly noticed.</p>

<p>In addition to the competitive examination of candidates for the post
of Assistant Surgeon, for which a medical degree is preliminary, the
successful candidates must spend four months at Netley, where the Army
Medical School is now located (since 1863), in connection with the Royal
Victoria Hospital (capable of receiving one thousand patients), where
large numbers of invalid patients of the army are treated. Here, with
every facility of study, observation, and practice, instruction is given
by four professors, each with an experienced assistant, in military
surgery, medicine, pathology, and hygiene, and all the specialities of
the military hospital and field practice, peculiarities of climate, etc.
After spending at least four months in the hospital, laboratory, museum,
and lecture-rooms, the candidate is then examined for his commission as
Assistant Surgeon.</p>

CHILDREN.</a></h5>

<p>In 1811, on the recommendation of the Duke of York, then
Commander-in-Chief, a royal warrant was issued, authorizing the
appointment of a sergeant-schoolmaster to each batallion for young
recruits and the children of soldiers, with provision for room, fuel,
and light in each regimental barrack, and allowance for necessary books
and stationery. In 1846, to give greater efficiency and uniformity to
the schools established under the warrant of 1811, a new warrant was
issued, requiring that the sergeant-schoolmaster should obtain a
certificate of fitness from the military training college at Chelsea,
and ordering the appointment of an inspector of army schools. In 1854,
the following classification of masters was introduced: <i>First
Class</i>, at 7<i>s.</i> a day and certain allowances; <i>Second
Class</i>, at 5<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> per day; <i>Third Class</i>, at
4<i>s.</i> per day; and <i>Assistants</i> at 2<i>s.</i> The first-class
schoolmaster was a warrant officer, and ranked next to those holding a
commission; the second and third class ranked next to sergeant-major,
and the assistants ranked as sergeants. At this time the privileges of
the regimental schools were extended to the children of discharged
soldiers, pensioners, and various persons employed about the barracks. A
schoolmistress was also employed for the infant division of pupils, and
for teaching needle-work to the girls. In 1863, the office of
superintending schoolmaster, with a relative rank of ensign, was
created, and four (since increased to twelve) from among the most
experienced first-class masters, were appointed to inspect and examine
all army schools in their several military districts, and candidates for
pupil-teachers and schoolmistresses.</p>

<p>According to the report of the Council of Military Education, for
March, 1870, there were two hundred and fifty-nine masters employed by
the army schools, and four hundred and eighty-five mistresses and
assistants in the children’s schools. In Great Britain there were three
hundred and eighteen schools, and thirty-five thousand three hundred and
seven non-commissioned officers and men on the books, nine thousand
three hundred and fifty-nine boys and girls, besides 11,414 children in
the infant schools.</p>


<h5><a name = "britain_others_asylum" id = "britain_others_asylum" href

<p>Prior to the establishment of the Army Schools in 1811, two large
institutions for orphan children of soldiers who had fallen in battle or
serving at foreign stations, had been founded and maintained at the
public expense.</p>

<p>The Royal Hibernian Institution at Dublin, Ireland, was commenced on
a sum appropriated by the Irish Parliament in 1765, and chartered in
1769. It has large buildings, with thirty-four acres of land, and
provides for four hundred and ten children on an annual parliamentary
grant of twelve thousand pounds for its maintenance, besides the income
from a small endowment.</p>

<p>The Royal Military Asylum in Chelsea was begun by the Duke of York in
1801, and can now accommodate five hundred children on a public grant of
twelve thousand pounds, besides a further grant of three thousand pounds
for furniture and clothing from the Board of Works and the general vote
of the army.</p>

<p>In the Military Asylum at Chelsea, since 1846, there has existed a
Normal School, where teachers of army schools may review their studies,
or candidates for vacancies, or pupil teachers, may qualify themselves
by study, observation, and practice, for appointment as schoolmasters,
and when found qualified they receive certificates of the first, second,
and third class, and are paid accordingly.</p>

<p>In the British Army the cost of maintaining the regimental bands
falls upon the officers. In the infantry a sergeant, a corporal and
nineteen privates are taken from the effective strength of each regiment
to form a band. These receive their ordinary regimental pay,&mdash;the
rest of the pay, and the entire salary of the band-master, if a
civilian, together with the cost of the music and musical instruments,
are provided out of the Band Fund, which is raised by “stoppages” from
the officers on first appointment, and promotion, and by subscription.
This fund is managed by a committee of officers. Owing to difficulties
in retaining the men, and of finding band-masters with all the requisite
qualifications, the Commander-in-Chief (Duke of Cambridge) established a
Military School of Music in 1856, in concert with the Secretary of War,
which was opened in Kneller Hall for the reception of pupils in March,
1857. The institution must be viewed (1) as a barrack, and (2) as a
school of music. (1). As a barrack it is under the direction of the
Secretary of War, and is managed as any other barrack. (2). As a school
it is under the immediate direction of a military officer (who is
appointed by the Commander-in-Chief), and a musical staff composed of
nine permanent professors, four occasional professors, and a varying
number of special assistants who are selected from the first-class
students. There is also a schoolmaster who gives instruction one hour a
day in general knowledge to each class, and a military chaplain. The
instruments taught in Soprano (8); Alto (3); Tenor (3); Bass (6). The
students are divided into four classes, each of which is divided into
sections according to the instruments to be learned. Seven hours a day
are devoted to obligatory study&mdash;but more are given, and a
restriction prohibits all practice after 6.45 in the evening.</p>

<p>This course of study occupies two years, and there is a higher which
comprises, beside practical instruction in playing and teaching the
instruments composing the band, some general acquirements under the
theory of harmony. There is also practical training in the duties of a
conductor. In addition to ordinary military music, classical concert
pieces, or chamber music, specially arranged for wind instruments, are
performed. Cheap admissions to the operas and principal concerts of the
metropolis are obtained (900 in one year), to such of the advanced
students as are recommended for diligence by the professors.</p>

<p>Pupils are selected from the various regiments, and often selected
for this special purpose. Boys specially trained for the bands are
obtained from the Royal Military Asylum, Chelsea, the Hibernian Military
School, Dublin, and the Metropolitan Poor-law School. Each candidate
must be examined by the surgeon of the regiment, and certified to as in
good health and with no tendencies to disease liable to be aggravated by
playing on a band instrument.</p>

<p>A military band-master is now sanctioned by the Government for any
regiment and battalion throughout the service, who receive regimental
pay of first-class staff sergeant, and 100<i>l.</i> from the Regimental
Band Fund.</p>

<p>The expenses of Kneller Hall as a barrack are borne by the
government; as a school of music, by the regimental
officers&mdash;including an original assessment of 5<i>l.</i> for supply
of instruments, and the salaries to about 1,100<i>l.</i> annually.</p>

<p>The average number of students annually admitted is 74; the average
number in attendance, 148. The total number admitted since 1857 is 592,
of whom 163 were practiced musicians, 63 band-masters, 271 band-men.</p>

<!-- VIII in TOC -->

<h4 class = "smallcaps">Preliminary Remarks.</h4>

<p><span class = "firstword">Before</span> describing a class of schools
in England, which is now receiving special attention and aid from the
Science and Art Department of the Committee of Council on Education,
viz. <span class = "smallcaps">Navigation Schools</span>, we will glance
at the condition of Nautical Education generally in this great maritime
and commercial country.</p>

<p>The old system of training officers for the Royal Navy, under which
mere children with the smallest possible amount of elementary knowledge,
made the ship their school, even after a Naval Academy was established,
had its peculiar advantages as well as its drawbacks. The captain,
having the nomination of an almost indefinite number of “youngsters,”
stood towards them in <i>loco parentis</i>. He was their governor,
guardian, and instructor, and did not “spare the rod” when he thought
its application necessary. The captain was then looked up to with a
feeling bordering on awe. Without assigning a reason he could disrate or
discharge a midshipman; and he could also do much towards pushing him on
in the service. The youngster felt that he was entirely in the power of
his captain, and, unless of a reckless cast, used his best endeavors to
gain his favor. The captain, on the other hand, talked of <i>his</i>
youngsters with pride. He, (if&nbsp;he belonged to the better class of
naval captains,) took care that every facility should be afforded them
for learning their duty, often made them his companions on shore, and
superintended their education afloat, sometimes taking a leading part in
their teaching. He felt responsible for their bringing up, for some were
sons of personal friends or relatives whom he had promised to watch over
the youthful aspirants, and all were more or less objects of interest to
him. But all this was swept away in 1844, and the captain’s patronage
limited to one nomination on commissioning a ship, the Admiralty taking
the rest of the patronage into their own keeping. And what was the
result? No sooner had the Admiralty absorbed the naval
patronage&mdash;for the captain was frequently shorn of his one
nomination before leaving Whitehall with his commission&mdash;than old
officers and private gentlemen in middling circumstances found
themselves unsuccessful applicants, while the influential country
gentleman totally unconnected with the service, but able perhaps to turn
the scale of an election, was not under the painful necessity of asking
twice for a naval cadetship for his son, or the son of his friend. But
what cared the captain for these Admiralty nominees? Too many of them
were incapable of profiting by
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page628" id = "page628">628</a></span>
their opportunities, and others neglected to avail themselves of the
instructions of the professors of mathematics, and became the victims of
dissipation.</p>

<p class = "heading"><a name = "britain_naval_academy" id =
"britain_naval_academy" href = "#britain_naval_officer"><i>Royal Naval
Academy.</i></a></p>

<p>The first attempt to educate lads for the naval service of England
was in 1729, when the Royal Naval Academy was instituted in Portsmouth
Dockyard. The course of instruction included the elements of a general
education, as well as mathematics, navigation, drawing, fortification,
gunnery, and small arm exercises, together with the French language, the
principles of ship-building and practical seamanship in all its
branches, for which latter a small vessel was set apart. The number was
limited to forty cadets, the sons of the nobility and gentry, and
attendance was voluntary. Small as the corps was, it was never full,
probably because there was an easier way of gaining admission to the
service through official favoritism, by appointment direct to some ship,
on board of which during a six years’ midshipman’s berth, he acquired a
small stock of navigation and a larger knowledge of seamanship and
gunnery practice. In these ships where the captains were educated men,
and took a special interest in the midshipmen, and competent instructors
were provided and sustained in their authority and rank, this system of
ship instruction and training worked well, as under the same conditions
it did with us. In 1773 a new stimulus was given to the Academy by
extending a gratuitous education to fifteen boys out of the forty, who
were sons of commissioned officers. In 1806, under the increased demand
for well educated officers, the whole number of cadets was increased to
seventy, of whom forty were the sons of officers and were educated at
the expense of the government. From this date to 1837 the institution
was designated the Royal Naval College, but without any essential
extension of its studies. In 1816 a Central School of Mathematics and
Naval Architecture was added to the establishment, and in 1828 the free
list was discontinued, and the sons of military officers were allowed to
share the privileges of the school with the sons of naval officers, at a
reduced rate in proportion to their rank. To keep up the number of
students who would go through the four years course, it became necessary
to extend special privileges, such as made promotion certain and rapid
over those who entered the navy direct. This produced inconveniences and
jealousies, and in 1837 the Naval College was discontinued.</p>

Ship and Naval College.</i></a></p>

<p>In 1857 the Admiralty adopted the plan of a Training Ship for naval
cadets. The candidate was to be from thirteen to fifteen years of age,
and to pass an examination in Latin or French, Geography, Arithmetic,
including Proportion and Fractions, Algebra, to Simple Equations, the
First Book of Euclid, and the Elements of Plane Trigonometry. At the end
of twelve or six months, according to age, spent in study and practice
on the Training Ship, the cadet was examined in the studies before
enumerated
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page629" id = "page629">629</a></span>
with the addition of Involution and Evolution, Simple Equations, the
Elements of Geometry, and of Plane and Spherical Trigonometry, the
simple rules of Navigation, the use of Nautical Instruments, Surveying,
Constructing Charts, and the French language, besides an elaborate
course of Seamanship, and attendance on lectures on Chemistry, Physics,
Hydrostatics, &amp;c. If this examination was satisfactory, the cadet
was appointed to a sea-going ship, and at the expiration of fifteen
months’ service he was eligible for the rating of midshipman upon
passing a further examination. The course in the Training Ship (first
the “Illustrious,” and subsequently changed to the “Britannia,” first in
Portsmouth harbor and more recently at Dartmouth,) proved too extensive
for mastery in one year; and in 1861 the conditions for admission were
lowered, the examinations in the school were made quarterly, and
competitive, and if passed creditably at the end of a year, according to
a fixed standard, (3,000 being the number of marks attainable, and 2,100
giving a first class certificate,) the cadet is rated at once as
midshipman, and credited a year’s sea-time. If he receives a second
class certificate (1,500 marks,) he must serve six months at sea, and
pass another examination before he can be rated midshipman. The cadet
with a third-rate certificate (1,200 marks,) must serve twelve months at
sea, and pass another examination for his midshipman’s rating. Prizes
and badges are also given, and the stimulus of competitive examination
is applied as shown in the grading of certificates.</p>

Instruction.</i></a></p>

<p>In 1832 a uniform and comprehensive system of gunnery instruction was
provided on the “Excellent,” under command of Captain (now Sir Thomas)
Hastings. To give such officers who were found deficient in the
scientific knowledge requisite for a full understanding of the theory of
gunnery, the Naval College was re-opened in 1839, under the general
superintendence of the Captain of the Excellent, with Professors of
Mathematics, Navigation and Nautical Astronomy, Steam Machinery,
Chemistry and Marine Artillery. Accommodations were provided for
twenty-five half-pay officers, (captains, commanders, and lieutenants,)
and a certain number of mates on full pay, for whom a special course of
study was instituted. The time allowed at the College was a clear year’s
study, exclusive of vacations, and those who have completed the course
rank among the most distinguished officers of the profession.</p>

Steam and the Steam-Engine.</i></a></p>

<p>When steam vessels came into use in the Navy, to qualify officers for
special service in them they were encouraged to resort to Woolwich
Dockyard, and afterward to the Portsmouth yard, where an instructor was
appointed and facilities for observation, study, and experiments were
provided. Many officers repaired to private factories, and worked at the
lathe, in stoke-hole and the engine-room, and thus acquired a practical
knowledge of this department of their profession. When the Naval College
was established
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page630" id = "page630">630</a></span>
on its present footing, a small steamer, the “Bee,” was built and
attached under the charge of the instructor in steam-machinery. And now
the greater part of the captains and commanders on the active list have
obtained certificates of having passed the course in Steam and the
Steam-engine.</p>

<p class = "heading"><i>Admiralty Order respecting Naval Cadets and
Midshipmen, dated April 1, 1860.</i></p>

<p class = "heading smallcaps">Cadets.</p>

<p>“I. No person will be nominated to a Cadetship in the Royal Navy who
shall be under 12, or above 14 years of age, at the time of his first
examination.</p>

<p>“II. Every candidate, on obtaining a nomination, will be required to
pass an examination at the Royal Naval College at Portsmouth, within
three months of nomination.<a class = "tag" name = "tag8_3" id =
"tag8_3" href = "#note8_3">3</a> In the special cases of nomination
granted to the sons of natives of the colonies a candidate will be
allowed to pass a preliminary examination on board the flag or senior
Officer’s ship on the Station. But such an examination must be passed in
strict accordance with these regulations, and should the candidate be
found qualified, it will still be necessary that he should be sent to
England, to be entered on board a training ship, where he will be
subject to the same regulations as other Cadets.</p>

<p>“III. The candidate must produce a certificate of birth, or a
declaration thereof made before a magistrate.</p>

<p>“IV. Must be in good health and fit for the Service&mdash;that is
free from impediment of speech, defect of speech, rupture, or other
physical inefficiency.</p>

<p>“Candidates will be required&mdash;1. To write English correctly from
dictation, and in a legible hand. 2.&nbsp;To read, translate, and parse
an easy passage from Latin, or from some foreign living
language&mdash;the aid of a dictionary will be allowed for these
translations.</p>

<p>“And to have a satisfactory knowledge of&mdash;3. The leading facts
of Scripture and English history. 4.&nbsp;Modern geography, in so far as
relates to a knowledge of the principal countries, capitals, mountains
and rivers. To be able to point out the position of a place on a map,
when its latitude and longitude are given. 5.&nbsp;Arithmetic, including
proportion, and a fair knowledge of vulgar and decimal fractions.
6.&nbsp;A&nbsp;knowledge of the definitions and axioms of the First Book
of Euclid.</p>

<p>“As drawing will prove a most useful qualification for Naval
Officers, it is recommended that candidates for the Service should be
instructed therein.</p>

<p>“V. Candidates will be allowed a second trial at the next quarterly
examination. Should he not pass this second examination he will be
finally rejected.</p>

<p>“VI. If the candidate succeeds in passing the required examination he
will be at once appointed to a training ship, for the purpose of
instruction in the subjects contained in Sheet No. 1,<a class = "tag"
name = "tag8_4" id = "tag8_4" href = "#note8_4">4</a> as well as in the
rigging of ships, seamanship, the use of nautical instruments,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>“VII. Quarterly examinations will be held on board the training ship,
when any candidate may be examined in the subjects contained in Sheet
No. 1, and also, in the course of instruction, in the rigging of ships,
seamanship, &amp;c.</p>

<p>“VIII. If a candidate be found at the quarterly examinations, not to
have made sufficient progress, or if, by indifferent conduct or idle
habits on board the training ship, he shall show his unfitness for the
Service; it will be the duty of the Captain to make a special report
thereof to the Admiralty, in order that the Cadet may be at once removed
from the Navy.</p>

<p>“IX. When the candidate shall have completed twelve months’
instruction, exclusive of vacations, in the harbor training ship, he
will be examined, and
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page631" id = "page631">631</a></span>
should he obtain a certificate of proficiency, he will be discharged
into the sea-going training ship. A&nbsp;first-class certificate will
entitle him to count twelve months’ sea time; a second-class, will
entitle him to count six months’ sea time; a third-class, will entitle
him to count six months’ sea time. But should he not obtain a
certificate, he will be discharged as unfit for the Service.</p>

<p>“X. On leaving the harbor training ship, it is intended that the
Cadet shall pass three months in a sea-going training ship, for
practical instruction in seamanship and navigation, which period will
count for sea time, and at the end of this period, if his conduct has
been satisfactory, he will be appointed to a ship with the rating of a
Midshipman.</p>


<p class = "heading smallcaps"><a name = "britain_naval_midshipmen" id =

"#britain_naval_officer">Midshipmen.</a></p>

<p>“To qualify a Midshipman for a Lieutenant’s Commission he must have
attained the full age of 19 years, and have completed 5½ years’ actual
service in Her Majesty’s Navy, including the time awarded to him on
leaving the training ship.</p>

<p>“XI. All Midshipmen, until they have passed their examinations for
Lieutenants, are to keep a book in which the ship’s reckoning is to be
worked out and noted; at sea, this book is to be sent in every day to
the Captain, instead of the slip of paper containing a day’s work. It is
also to be produced at their examinations; and during the last six
months of their service as Midshipmen, it must contain the working of
the observations.</p>

<p>“XII. A Midshipman when he shall have served two years and a half in
that rank will be required to pass the following
examination:&mdash;1.&nbsp;In practical navigation, showing that he
understands the principle of navigating a ship from one distant port to
another, by dead reckoning and by his own observations; and that he can
explain the principles of the same; and that he can also take and work a
double altitude and azimuth. 2.&nbsp;A&nbsp;sufficient knowledge of a
chart to enable him to place thereon the position of the ship by
observation as well as by cross bearings; and to lay off the true and
compass courses. 3.&nbsp;Such knowledge of nautical surveying as may
enable him to measure a base line and determine positions by angles, and
the manner of ascertaining heights and distances. 4.&nbsp;If he has
served in a steam vessel, an acquaintance with the different parts and
working of the steam engine. 5.&nbsp;A&nbsp;proficiency in French to be
attained if he has had an opportunity. 6.&nbsp;He must be a good
practical observer, and his sextant must be produced in good order.
7.&nbsp;He must produce log-books kept by himself from the time of his
entering into a sea-going ship, and certificates of good conduct.</p>

<p>“8. He will likewise be examined as to his progress in the knowledge
of rigging masts, bowsprits, &amp;c. He must also know the great gun and
small arm exercise, the use of tangent sights, the charges for the guns
of the ship, and be able to exercise the men at his quarters.
A&nbsp;report of the progress he has made in each of the above subjects
is to be made to the Secretary of the Admiralty in the half-yearly
return.</p>

<p>“This examination is to be conducted by the Officer in command, not
below the rank of Commander, and the next senior Officer in the ship,
and the examinations in navigation in the presence of a Captain or
Commander, by two Naval Instructors, when it may be practicable, or by a
Naval Instructor and a Master, or, where there is no Naval Instructor,
by two Masters; that in gunnery, by a gunner, or other competent
Officer; and the candidate is to be made to take and work out his own
observations for latitude, longitude, variation, &amp;c., as the case
may be. First or second class certificates are to be given according to
the merit of the candidate, in the form A, page 8, or he is to be
rejected if found incompetent.</p>

<p>“XIII. A Midshipman, having completed his term of service, and being
19 years of age, may be provisionally examined by the Captain or
Commander of such ship or vessel with the aid of other competent
Officers, Lieutenant, Master, or second Master, when no other ships are
present; and if they find him to be duly qualified they are to give him
a certificate to that effect, dated on the day of such examination, and
the Captain may forthwith give him an acting order as Mate; but he must
be re-examined, on the first opportunity that shall afterwards offer, by
three Captains or Commanders, and if he passes successfully he
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page632" id = "page632">632</a></span>
will receive from the Commander-in-Chief, or senior Officer, an acting
order as Mate, to take rank according to the first certificate.</p>

<p>“The examining Officers are to be most strict in their investigation
of the qualifications of Officers, and they are to see that everything
required by these Regulations has been complied with by the candidates,
and that he produces certificates of good conduct from Captains he has
served under from the time of his discharge from the training ship.</p>

<p>“XIV. All Acting Mates and Midshipmen will be required to undergo the
following final examinations,&mdash;1.&nbsp;In Seamanship&mdash;On board
the training ship at Portsmouth. 2.&nbsp;In Gunnery&mdash;On board the
<i>Excellent</i>. 3.&nbsp;In Navigation and the Steam Engine&mdash;At
the Royal Naval College.</p>

<p>“Acting Mates, who have already passed abroad, are to present
themselves for examination, on board the training ship at Portsmouth, at
the first examination day after their arrival in England, or after being
paid off, and having passed in gunnery they are then at liberty to
select either the first, second, or third examination day at the Royal
Naval College.</p>

<p>“XV. Any Officer rejected on his first examination at the College
will incur the forfeiture of three months’ seniority in his rank as
Mate. He may present himself on the next examination day, but a second
rejection will incur the forfeiture of three months’ more seniority; he
may again present himself on the next examination day, but a third
rejection will cause his name to be removed from the list of the
Navy.</p>

<p>“XVI. Officers, when they have passed their final examination at the
Royal Naval College, as provided for in these Regulations, will be
confirmed from the date of their first certificate. The non-appearance
of an Officer for examination at the Royal Naval College at the times
required by these Regulations will be considered as an acknowledgment of
his not being qualified, and he will be dealt with in the same manner as
if he had been actually rejected, on each day on which he may have
omitted to appear, unless under certified ill-health, to be duly
reported at the time.</p>

<p>“XVII. Naval Instructors are to keep a school journal, or register,
which is to be produced when required by the Captain of the ship or the
examining Officers, and the Captain is to allow them reasonable access
to the charts and chronometers, for the purpose of instructing the
Officers in their use.</p>

<p>“XVIII. The Captains of Her Majesty’s ships are to take care that a
convenient place is set apart and proper hours are fixed for instruction
by the Naval Instructor; and all Acting Mates and Acting Second Masters,
as well as all executive Officers under that rank, are to attend; and
care is also to be taken that they are regularly instructed in practical
seamanship, rigging, and the steam-engine, and a monthly examination day
is to be established.</p>
</div>

<p>The subject of Education for Officers has been recently under
discussion in Parliament, and some modifications of the existing system
is now under the consideration of the Admiralty, looking to greater
maturity of age and preparation for admission, a more extended and
thorough course of scientific training in cadets, and continued
opportunities of study with accompanying examinations for officers up to
the grade of commanders.</p>


<h4 class = "smallcaps"><a name = "britain_naval_artillery" id =
"britain_naval_artillery" href = "#britain_naval">II. The Royal Marine
Artillery</a>.</h4>

<p>In 1804 an artillery company was attached to each of the three
divisions of the Royal Marine Corps, to supply the service of the
bomb-vessels, and in time of peace, to drill the whole of the marines in
gunnery. But they were soon made available for other purposes, and on
the outbreak of the American war in 1812, a large body of the Marine
Artillery, with a field battery and rocket equipment, accompanied the
battalions of marines then formed for service in America. In 1817 this
force was augmented to eight companies, and Sir Howard Douglass, while
advocating the establishment
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page633" id = "page633">633</a></span>
of “Naval Depots of Instruction,” for the purpose of converting officers
and men of the Royal Navy into efficient gunners, complimented the
Marine Artillery as being “either a corps of good infantry, of
scientific bombardiers, or expert field artillery men, well constituted,
thoroughly instructed, and ably commanded.” It was not until June, 1830,
that an Admiralty order directed that a school of gunnery should be
established at Portsmouth, on board the “Excellent,” and with the
intention of making this school the one means of instruction in this
department, it was farther ordered, in December, 1831, that the Marine
Artillery, as a distinct and separate corps, should be broken up,
retaining two companies as a nucleus of a larger force, should such
become necessary. And the necessity appeared; for the experience of a
few years proved that it would be impossible for the school to effect,
to any important extent, the results which were desired. In 1841,
therefore, a third company of the artillery was ordered; in 1845, two
more; and by subsequent additions, its strength was raised in 1859, to
sixteen companies, with a total of 3,000 officers and men, who were
formed into a separate division with its head quarters at Fort
Cumberland.</p>

<p>The officers of the Marine Artillery were at first appointed from the
marine corps, without any particular qualifications being required, but
afterwards their appointments were made probationary and conditional
upon the satisfactory completion of a prescribed mathematical course. In
1839 it was decided that a certain number of second lieutenants should
be allowed to prepare themselves for examination on board the Excellent,
and upon the re-opening of the Royal Naval College as an educational
establishment for mates, it was arranged that the students for the
artillery should be transferred to it, and that their success or
failure, after a years’ further study, should decide upon their
appointment to the artillery. Another and final modification took place
upon the introduction of preliminary examinations for the marines, and
the subsequent formation of a cadet establishment on board the
Excellent. In case of vacancies in the artillery, those who had passed
the best examinations upon first entering the corps, were selected for
the College, and no officers were allowed to become candidates on any
other terms, their final success depending as before, upon the progress
they might make as students at the College.</p>

<p>The cadets have their periods of study limited to two years; it may
be less, but can not be more. They have to acquire a competent knowledge
in Arithmetic, Algebra, Euclid, including the first four books and part
of the sixth, Plane Trigonometry, the use of the Sextant, Fortification,
English History, and French. To this may be added a practical course of
Naval Gunnery. Their studies are carried on under the direction of a
mathematical instructor, and an instructor of fortification.
A&nbsp;French master attends twice a week. If on obtaining his
commission, the young marine officer is selected to qualify for the
artillery at College, he must be prepared at the end of a year to pass
an examination in Analytical Trigonometry, Differential and Integral
Calculus, Conic Sections, Statics and Dynamics,
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page634" id = "page634">634</a></span>
Hydrostatics, and “Steam,” besides being required to have an increased
knowledge of Arithmetic, Algebra, and Fortification. In a year little
more than a superficial knowledge of these studies can possibly be
attained, yet insufficient as this period clearly is, it has sometimes
been the case that, when a large number of subalterns were required for
the artillery, young officers have been appointed who have completed
only half their term at College. Having thus gained his appointment to
the artillery, his remaining in it depends upon there being a vacancy or
not at the time when his seniority on the general list of the corps
advances him to each successive grade of rank.</p>

<p>The men are volunteers from the light infantry divisions, possessing
certain specified qualifications as to age, height, intelligence and
character.</p>

<p>The course of training, which is with a few exceptions, common to
both officers and men, is very comprehensive; it includes&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The usual infantry drills and musketry instruction.</p>

<p>2. The exercise of field guns and rockets, with such field battery
movements as are of real practical importance.</p>

<p>3. The service of heavy ordnance, including guns, howitzers, and sea
and land service mortars.</p>

<p>4. The naval great gun exercise.</p>

<p>5. Mounting and dismounting ordnance, with or without machines.</p>

<p>6. The various methods of slinging and transporting ordnance.</p>

<p>7. Knotting, splicing, and fitting gun gear, use of pulleys,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>8. A laboratory course, including:&mdash;use and preparation of
tubes, rockets, and fuzes; making up cartridges; manufacture of port
fires, Valenciennes stars, signal rockets, blue lights, &amp;c., with
instruction in the manufacture and effects of gunpowder and other
explosive compounds.</p>

<p>9. A course of practical gunnery, comprising&mdash;instruction in the
nature and uses of the various kinds of guns, howitzers, and mortars; in
the natures, employment, and effects of the various projectiles;
disparting and sighting ordnance; heating and firing red-hot shot; and
such matters connected with the theory of projectiles as may have a
practical application.</p>

<p>10. Practice from different natures of ordnance, with every
description of projectile.</p>

<p>The system of instruction is so arranged that every officer and
noncommissioned officer is qualified, as far as practicable, as an
instructor, a registry being kept of each man’s progress and
capabilities. A&nbsp;spirit of emulation has been created, attended with
the happiest results, and the whole course is now gone through in less
than twelve months, without the men being wearied or overworked.</p>

<i>Seamen’s Schoolmasters.</i></a></p>

<p>Schoolmasters for seamen are allowed on all ships having a complement
of not less than three hundred men, and an allowance of £5 per annum is
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page635" id = "page635">635</a></span>
granted, in addition to the pay of any rating he may hold, to a
qualified person doing this duty of the captain’s orders, in ships not
having a seamen’s schoolmaster. An allowance is made for books, slates,
&amp;c. to all ships having schools. The success of the school to the
boys and the men depends mainly on the interest shown in it by the
captain and second officer in command, and especially on the character
of the schoolmaster employed. The situation is too often filled by an
old quartermaster, or sergeant of marines, who obtains the berth as a
kind of retirement, or by some person who has a fancy for sea life, but
who is fit for nothing on shore, much less for teaching under the
difficulties of a ship at sea. It is found that when the schoolmaster is
qualified for this special service, and is entered for continuous
service, and being placed in regard to pay, pension, and good conduct
badges on an equality with other chief petty officers, and when a log or
register of attendance is kept, and frequent reports are made to
superior authority, the result is highly conducive to discipline, and to
the elevation of the seamen’s habits and character. One of the
Commissioners recently appointed to examine into the state of popular
education among every class of British subjects, speaking of the effect
of this class of schools upon the men on board the ships, says: “After
visiting the “Cambridge,” at Plymouth, as I walked with the captain
through the lower deck, I&nbsp;found many, both boys and men, reading
books with the greatest attention. In the evening of the same day, on
the lower deck of the “Agincourt,” I&nbsp;found the same scene, while
others were engaged in draughts, chess, or writing letters to their
friends.” With the present scale of punishment on board of men of war,
the school is an indispensable element of discipline. The Commissioners
referred to, in their report to the Queen, recommend that schoolmasters
of higher qualification be appointed, with an increase of pay, and
promotion by merit, when their schools are reported favorably upon by
any authorized inspectors, and with the same retiring pension as
master-at-arms, and that in addition to an elementary general education,
a knowledge of navigation, physical geography, and natural history be
required of candidates.</p>


<p class = "heading"><a name = "britain_naval_harbor" id =

<p>A second class of naval schools consists of Harbor Ships, into which
boys entered for admission to the Navy, are received until they are
drafted into the various sea-going ships. Four of these ships, the
“Victory” and “Excellent,” at Portsmouth, the “Impregnable” and
“Cambridge,” at Plymouth, are specially devoted to instruction. Boys
remain in these ships for one year. The first part of this period is
generally spent on board the ship, the latter part in the practising
brig, in which during the summer months they are out at sea for five
days during the week. There is a school under a seamen’s schoolmaster on
board of each of these ships. The Commissioners report that the school
time is necessarily subject to great interruptions, but that much
valuable instruction might be given with better organization and
methods. They recommend that an educational
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page636" id = "page636">636</a></span>
test for admission to these training ships be introduced, which would at
once have a good effect upon the general education of the people
resident in the seaport towns, and elevate the intelligence, morality
and manners of the seamen.</p>


<p class = "heading"><a name = "britain_naval_marine" id =

Marine Schools.</i></a></p>

<p>There are four schools attached to the divisions of marines quartered
in barracks respectively at Woolwich, Chatham, Portsmouth and Plymouth,
and another to the division of marine artillery quartered at Portsmouth.
These five schools are attended by the marines and their children. The
attendance of the men is for the most part voluntary, with the exception
of the non-commissioned officers, who are obliged to attend the school
until they have passed a prescribed examination. In the marine artillery
every man is required to read and write, and if deficient in these
respects, he is obliged to attend the school until his requirements are
reported to be satisfactory. The Commissioners recommend that a better
class of schoolmasters be specially trained and employed, and that they
receive better rank and pay, and more efficient assistance in the
discharge of their duties, and that trained mistresses be employed as
assistants in the boys’ schools, and have the exclusive charge of the
girls’ schools, in all of which sewing should be taught and practised
daily.</p>


<p class = "heading"><a name = "britain_naval_dockyard" id =
"britain_naval_dockyard" href = "#britain_naval_warrant">4. <i>Dock-yard
Schools.</i></a></p>

<p>There are seven dock-yard schools, held in the respective dock-yards
of Deptford, Woolwich, Chatham, Sheerness, Portsmouth, Devenport, and
Pembroke. They were founded in 1840, and are designed for the
instruction of the apprentices employed in these establishments. The
masters of them were originally foremen of the yard, men of good
attainments, who had for the most part received their education in the
School of Naval Architecture; but in 1847 a special class of
schoolmasters was established, ranking as foremen of the yard. The
object of these schools is to advance the education of the young men,
since none are admitted as apprentices to become shipwrights until they
have passed an examination.</p>

<p>Examinations for admission as apprentices to the dock-yards are held
half-yearly, and about one-half are given to the lads who pass the best
examinations, and the other half to nominees of the superintendent.
These latter, however, are required to come up to a prescribed
intellectual standard. The examinations are held under the Civil Service
Commissioners, in the following subjects:&mdash;1.&nbsp;Dictation
exercises to test Hand-writing and Orthography. 2.&nbsp;Reading.
3.&nbsp;Arithmetic. 4.&nbsp;Grammar. 5.&nbsp;English Composition.
6.&nbsp;Geography. 7.&nbsp;Mathematics, (Euclid, first three books,
Algebra including Quadratic Equations, Arithmetical and Geometrical
Progression.) The master shipwright and the schoolmaster are of opinion
that the boys entered by competition are the best, and among the working
shipwrights themselves the opinion is unanimous that the system of
entering at least one-half by competition ought not to be done away.
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page637" id = "page637">637</a></span>
The effect in inducing parents to keep their children at school in order
to fit their sons for examination is very manifest, and the justice of
promotion by personal merit is felt and acknowledged by all.</p>

<p>For the first three years all the apprentices are compelled to
attend, while those in the fourth year may volunteer to attend with
others if they show an aptitude for study, and a disposition to profit
by the opportunities afforded them. The fifth-year apprentices may
attend after the hours of labor. So long as admission to the Central
School of Mathematics and Naval Construction at Portsmouth, and an
immediate appointment and regular advancement to the higher offices in
the yard, after leaving the latter establishment, stimulated young men
to the acquisition of knowledge, the attendance for the fourth year was
numerous and regular. But the abolition of the School of Mathematics,
and with it the consequent promotion of its graduates, operated very
unfavorably both on attendance and habits of private study.</p>

<p>In 1859 the Admiralty adopted a supplementary course of study for
such apprentices as have been diligent in their work, exemplary in
conduct, and made satisfactory progress in acquiring a knowledge of
their trade. This course, extending over two years for three hours a
day, embraces Descriptive Geometry, Elementary Mechanics, and
Hydrostatics, Logarithms, Calculations of displacement, Stability of
ships, &amp;c., Plane Trigonometry, Differential Calculus, with
Analytical Geometry, Advanced Mechanics, Hydrostatics, and Dynamics.
This class of apprentices perform the duty ordinarily devolved on mould
loft apprentices, under the superintendence of the draughtsmen in the
mould loft. Scholarships of twenty pounds per annum are granted to such
members of the class as show superior ability, attainments, and good
conduct.</p>

<p>In the year 1859 there were 1,060 pupils in the five Dock-yard
Schools, viz.: 461 apprentices, and 599 factory boys, the latter
attending mainly in the evening.</p>

<p>The Commissioners pronounce these schools valuable institutions, both
to the state and to the individuals, and they have demonstrated,
according to the testimony of one of the master shipwrights, that the
educated boy makes the superior workman, and the most moral and
temperate man. They recommend that a better class of teachers be
employed, and that their pay should be increased by half the amount of
the scholarship accorded to the most proficient pupils of the advanced
class, and that the intellectual part of the examinations for promotion
should be conducted by the Civil Service Commissioners. To make this
class of schools what they should be, much must be done to improve the
education of the laboring classes, outside of the dock-yards.</p>

Hospital Schools.</i></a></p>

<p>The Greenwich Hospital School for 200 pupils, the orphans and sons of
disabled seamen, and known as the Upper School, was founded in 1715. In
1805 the Royal Naval Asylum (founded in 1798,) consisting of 600 boys
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page638" id = "page638">638</a></span>
and 200 girls, was removed to Greenwich, and in 1821, was united to the
former, and was designated the Lower School, making in that year (1821)
a total of 1,000 children. In 1828, the number of boys in the Lower
School was reduced to 400, and the Upper to 600, one-third of the latter
being the sons of commissioned and ward-room officers. In 1841, the
girls’ school was abolished, leaving 400 in the Upper, and 400 in the
Lower School.</p>

<p>The schools are supported partly by the income of a special endowment
(£136,000,) and partly by the general funds of the Hospital. The total
expenditure for the two schools in 1859 was £20,234, for an average
attendance of 774 boys.</p>

<p>Boys are admitted to the Lower School solely upon the claims of their
fathers’ services. Until quite recently admissions to the Upper School
were by patronage, but by recent regulations all exclusive privileges of
nomination have been discontinued, and all claims for admission into the
school (the distinction of Upper and Lower School having been done
away,) are decided by a Committee of Selection, according to a scale
laid down. The 110 boys found to be best in the last examination of
1860, were constituted the Nautical School, admission to which is now
gained by competitive examination among the other boys of the school.
The instruction of this school (for a Nautical School had always
existed, composed of the two first classes of the Upper School,) is
confined to Mathematics and Navigation, and qualifies its recipients to
rise in their profession as masters’ assistants in the Royal Navy, and
as midshipmen and apprentices in the merchant service. A&nbsp;system of
pupil teachers, selected on account of aptitude for teaching, and a
willingness to adopt the profession of schoolmaster as their career in
life, has been recently introduced.</p>

<p>The Commissioners referred to, recommend that a Normal School for the
Navy be established at Greenwich, similar to that for the Army at
Chelsea, that the present pupil-teachers who are above the age of
eighteen form the nucleus of this school, and that others to the number
of ten at first, be admitted after examination; that the course of their
education be adapted to their future calling, and that at the close of
their career they be examined, and receive a certificate of
qualification. These teachers thus educated and trained, would be fitted
to take charge of the Navigation Schools, under the Board of Trade;
would enter the Dock-yard Schools, as assistants at first, and they
would be appointed to masterships on board the Training Ships, both in
the royal and commercial ports.</p>

<p>They also recommend that boys from the second class in the Ship
Schools be selected to serve as pupil-teachers under the schoolmasters,
and that a small allowance be made them, in addition to their pay, if
they pass a satisfactory examination at the end of the year, and their
conduct is reported to be satisfactory, and at the end of three years
they be admitted, if found competent, to the Normal School at Greenwich,
or that they be entered for continuous service as assistant
schoolmasters, with rank and pay and pension of first class petty
officers. At the end of two years
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page639" id = "page639">639</a></span>
this last class of assistants, if found competent, will be admitted to
the practising school at Greenwich, for six months at the least, during
which residence they will devote their time to the art of teaching, and
to the study of Navigation, Physical Geography, and Natural History. On
the completion of their training they will go out as Royal Navy
Schoolmasters, and will be divided into three classes, viz.: 3d class,
who shall have the rank and pay of chief petty officers, (continuous
service,) and shall be entitled to the same pension. 2d class, who shall
rank above master-at-arms, and shall receive the same pay and pension.
1st class, shall rank with third class warrant officers, with same pay
and pension, and after long and approved service, masters of this class
shall be eligible for further promotion to rank and pay of second and
first class warrant officers. Schoolmasters in each of these classes
shall be entitled to £10 per annum in addition to their pay, if they are
recommended by the captain and chaplain, and their schools are certified
to be in an efficient state when examined.</p>

SCHOOLS.</a></p>

<p>In 1853 the English Government constituted the Department of Science
and Art, to extend a system of encouragement to local institutions of
Practical Science, similar to that commenced a few years before in the
Department of Practical Art, the two Departments being united in the
course of the same year, and the united Department being administered at
first by the Board of Trade, and in 1856, by the Education Department.
To this Department of Science and Art, was assigned in 1853 the general
management of a class of schools which had been instituted or aided by
the Mercantile Marine Department of the Board of Trade, for the benefit
of the navigation interests of the country. Instruction in navigation
was given in the seaports by private teachers, without system, and to a
very small number of those who should be well grounded in the principles
of the art before being entrusted with the responsibilities of command,
involving the lives and property of others. To introduce system, to give
permanent employment to a larger number of well-qualified teachers of
navigation, to elevate and improve the attainments and character of
British masters, mates and seamen, and indirectly but largely increase
the supply for the Royal Navy in time of war, the Government had
determined to encourage local effort in establishing Nautical Schools.
With this view the Marine Department of the Board of Trade had
established two schools prior to 1853, one in London, and the other in
Liverpool; and an arrangement had been made with the Admiralty, by which
it was believed five or six pupil-teachers, who had completed their term
of instruction at the Royal Naval School at Greenwich, would be able to
attend the scientific courses in the Metropolitan Schools of Science and
Art, and be instructed in those sciences which would better fit them to
become masters of schools of navigation in the
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page640" id = "page640">640</a></span>
seaport towns. In 1854, the Trinity House<a class = "tag" name =
"tag8_5" id = "tag8_5" href = "#note8_5">5</a> of Hull reorganized its
old school of navigation, after the plan of the Royal Naval School at
Greenwich, with two divisions, the lower for a class of boys who need
elementary instruction, and the upper, for boys in the technical studies
of a seafaring life. With the latter was opened an evening school for
adult seamen. Similar schools, with a junior or lower division to revise
and complete the general and preparatory studies, and a senior or upper
school for special scientific and practical instruction in navigation
and seamanship, were established at Yarmouth, Leith, Glasgow, Aberdeen,
Belfast, Dublin, Waterford, and other ports, fifteen in all up to 1862,
giving instruction to over 3,000 persons, and all of them enlisting
local co-operation and individual payment with governmental aid. As an
example of this class of schools we cite a brief description of one of
the earliest established, from a Report of the Inspector, Edward Hughes,
one of the masters of the Greenwich Hospital Schools.</p>

Navigation School.</i></a></p>

<p><i>The London Navigation School</i> is held on the upper floor of the
Sailors’ Home Institution, situated in Well Street, London Dock, and
consists of two separate apartments, occupied by the Upper and Lower
sections.</p>

<p>The upper section is for the instruction of masters and mates of the
merchant service in the following subjects, viz.:</p>

<p>Sextant Observing. Chart Drawing. Geometry. Algebra. Trigonometry.
The Sailings. Use of the Nautical Almanac and Mathematical Tables.
Principle and Construction of Chronometers. Methods of determining the
Latitude and Longitude. Nautical Surveying. Compasses and Magnetism of
Ships. Theory of Winds, Tides, and Currents. Methods of taking and
recording Meteorological Observations. Principle and Construction of the
Steam Engine as applied to the Paddle Wheel and Screw Propeller.</p>

<p>The Lower section is for the education of seamen and apprentices. The
course embraces the following subjects:&mdash;</p>

<p>Reading. Writing. Dictation and Letter Writing. Arithmetic.
Geography. The Sailings. Sextant Observing. Method of Keeping Ships’
Books.</p>

<p>The hours of attendance are from 9 to 12 a.m., 2 to 4 p.m., and 6 to
9 p.m. on the first five days of the working week, and from 9 to 12 a.m.
on Saturdays.</p>

<p>The fees are six shillings per week for masters and mates, sixpence
for seamen, and apprentices are admitted free.</p>

<p>The instruction of both sections is conducted by teachers who have
been educated and trained in the Greenwich Hospital Schools, and who
hold certificates of competency for teaching Navigation and Nautical
Astronomy, from Mr. Riddle, the Head Master of the Nautical School.</p>

<p>As regards the students who at present attend the school, it is
manifest that the masters and mates taught in the senior section come
for the express purpose of learning to solve certain problems in
Navigation and Nautical Astronomy, required for passing the examination
of the Local Marine Board, and they are unwilling to devote any portion
of their time to the other subjects that enter into the course of
instruction. These, though essential to the education of every master
mariner, are unfortunately not at present required of a candidate to
pass an examination which proclaims him competent to take command of a
vessel.</p>

<p>The lower section is composed of seamen and apprentices, who are for
the most part employed during the day at their ships in the docks, and
have acquired
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page641" id = "page641">641</a></span>
the rudiments of an English education before entering the school. They
attend during their short stay in port from 6 to 9 in the evenings, and
their chief object seems to be to acquire a knowledge of the sailings
and the methods of keeping the books of a ship.</p>

<p>Both sections are taught the use of nautical instruments, and for
this important purpose the Board of Trade has granted a liberal supply
of requisites to carry out an efficient system of instruction, as will
be seen by the list appended to this Report.</p>

<p>Those students who are sufficiently educated are accustomed to work
out their own observations. None of them have been allowed to leave the
school without receiving as great an amount as was possible of general
information, in addition to the special instruction in the subjects for
which they attended. Lectures have been delivered in the evenings upon
the Steam Engine, Electricity, and Magnetism, with other branches of
Natural Philosophy; and the Physical Geography of the Ocean has received
particular attention.</p>

<p class = "heading"><i>School Ships.</i></p>

<p>There is another class of nautical schools for destitute and
endangered boys, which are aided by the government through the Ragged
School Society, and are kept on board of ships, the practical seamanship
of which might advantageously be incorporated into the navigation
schools. The expense of these ships per day is thus given by Capt.
Ryder, in his Report on Navigation Schools in 1858.</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>I have collected some statistics showing the expense of school ships.
The Akbar, a frigate at Liverpool, is a reformatory, and has about a 100
boys. The Venus, also a frigate, is in charge of the Marine Society, and
anchored near Woolwich; she is a school ship for destitute lads, and has
about 140 boys. In the Akbar, supported, partly by local contributions
and partly by the Government grant of one shilling a day for each boy,
the expense of the establishment is probably reduced to as low a scale
as possible. The Marine Society is a
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page642" id = "page642">642</a></span>
corporation which can afford to be more liberal in its arrangements. The
Akbar was fitted out at an expense of 1,800<i>l.</i> but about
1,000<i>l.</i> is considered to be sufficient for a fit out, if the hull
is in good repair. The Marine Society’s ships are always fitted out by
the Admiralty without charge. The Akbar costs about 250<i>l.</i> a year
for repairs, &amp;c.</p>

<p class = "heading"><i>Outline of Aims and Management of Navigation
Schools.</i></p>

<p>In 1858, Captain Alfred P. Ryder, of the Royal Navy, was appointed to
inspect the Navigation Schools connected with the Department of Science
and Art, and report on their condition and future management. The
statements and suggestions of this report harmonize so fully with the
conclusions which we have reached respecting the need and mode of
establishing and managing this class of schools in our own country, that
we can not better express our own views than by making liberal
extracts.</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>The Government is very anxious to raise the tone of the Commercial
Marine for the following reasons:&mdash;</p>

<p>(<i>a.</i>) Because the Commercial Marine supplies even in time of
peace a considerable number of men to the Royal Navy, and because in
time of war we should have to rely upon it almost entirely to enable us
to man our ships when our reserves were exhausted, which would soon be
the case in a naval war.</p>

<p>(<i>b.</i>) Because on the efficiency of our commercial marine
depends to a great extent our position as a commercial country, and on
our position as the greatest commercial country rests our supremacy
among European nations.</p>

<p>(<i>c.</i>) Because to the commercial marine is entrusted every year
an immense amount of valuable property. Want of skill, intelligence, and
readiness of resource largely increases the yearly loss of this
property.</p>

<p>(<i>d.</i>) Because to the commercial marine every year are entrusted
the lives of a large and increasing number of Her Majesty’s subjects.
Want of skill, intelligence, and readiness of resource largely increase
the yearly loss of life at sea.</p>

<p>(<i>e.</i>) Because the commercial marine consists of more than
200,000 persons, and is, therefore, an important portion of the nation,
considering it numerically.</p>

<p>(<i>f.</i>) Because the commercial marine represents England, its
religion, laws, customs, and habits, in every foreign country, and it is
desirable that our representatives should cease to exhibit (as&nbsp;is
now frequently the case,) the worst side of the national character.
Large numbers of the sailors in our commercial marine are at present
neither good men nor good sailors, but are disorderly, addicted to
drink, inefficient at sea and all but useless in harbor. Many of them
who reach the rank of mate and master compare disadvantageously in
general knowledge with the mates and masters of foreign vessels. There
are of course numerous brilliant exceptions. They are to be found
chiefly in the service of the large ship-owners. In knowledge of
seamanship English masters and mates need not fear a comparison with
those of any other nation.</p>

<p>The Government, anxious to raise the tone of the Commercial Marine,
has endeavored to purify the stream at its source, by the creation or
support of Navigation Schools, in order that as soon as possible, by the
introduction of well educated lads, its character may be elevated and
improved. The Navigation Schools referred to are supported by fees, by
local subscriptions, and by aid from the Department of Science and Art.
Their object is to offer instruction in
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page643" id = "page643">643</a></span>
the scientific branches of an Education specially adapted to the
Nautical Profession.</p>

<p>In commencing an investigation into the present position and
prospects of the Navigation schools, it is evidently advisable to
ascertain the number of vacancies that occur annually in the commercial
marine; these vacancies are occasioned by death, desertion, and change
of profession. It is much to be desired that these vacancies should all
be filled by well educated English, Scotch, and Irish lads, for in time
of war we could only recruit from the Commercial Marine those sailors
who are British subjects.<a class = "tag" name = "tag8_6" id = "tag8_6"
href = "#note8_6">6</a></p>
</div>

<p>Capt. Ryder estimates the number of lads required to supply the
annual vacancies by death in the British Commercial Marine at over
5,000, and by desertion and change of profession, by at least 1,000
more, or a total of over 6,000; and that schools for seamen and officers
should be sufficient to give an annual supply of at least that number,
and so accommodate 18,000 students. According to the Report of the
Registrar General of Seamen, there were bound and registered at the
several ports of the United Kingdom, in the year 1856, 7,410
apprentices. The 176,387 men (not including masters,) employed in the
Home and Foreign Trade, were classified as follows: 21,204 mates, 13,232
petty officers, 83,682 seamen, 23,974 apprentices and boys, 12,640 other
persons, 1,612 engineers, 4,896 firemen. Of this number 14,375 were
foreigners, and 7,712 lascars. During the year 1856, examinations were
passed for extra masters, 22; for ordinary masters, 1,223; for first
mates, 689; for only mates, 12,223; for second mates, 940&mdash;a total
of 4,097. Capt. Ryder calculates that the total number required every
year to fill up the vacancies and meet the demands of an expanding
commerce as follows:</p>

<table class = "plaintext numbers">
<tr>
<td>Of those who leave the service,</td>
<td>6,690</td>

<tr>

<td>1,300</td>

<td>2,660</td>

<td>The average annual increase by expansion of commerce,</td>
<td>3,365</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class = "total">Total supply required,</td>
<td class = "sum">14,015</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Capt. Ryder remarks that the system of nautical education should be
broad enough and attractive enough to bring in all the boys of all
classes who wish to go to sea, or may be required to meet the demands of
the national and commercial marine. The education given should make
athletic, intelligent, handy seamen, and impart such an amount of
scientific knowledge of navigation and seamanship as will qualify a due
proportion for a lower grade of officers.</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>The first point to be aimed at would apparently be the establishment
of an adequate number of schools, so as to offer scientific instruction
on the lowest terms to a sufficient number of boys, to supply the demand
for educated young men to fill the vacancies in the ranks of masters and
mates. Their knowledge of seamanship must of course be gained before the
mast.</p>

<p>A commercial navy, fed by a supply of lads that had for three years
attended
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page644" id = "page644">644</a></span>
the classes at a Navigation school would challenge comparison for
general knowledge and information with any profession in England, and
would soon cease to be the last resort of those idle, troublesome
fellows, expelled from the agricultural class and the various trades,
who are too old, too ignorant, or too profligate ever to make even
indifferent sailors.</p>

<p>Having stated what appears to me to be the ground that may be
beneficially covered by a network of navigation schools, I&nbsp;will
proceed to state what, in my opinion, are the means by which a
Navigation School may be rendered most attractive and efficient.</p>

<p class = "inhead">I. <i>A Navigation School assisted by the Government
should offer sound Instruction especially adapted to the Nautical
Profession.</i></p>

<p>Although at first sight the number of subjects named hereafter may
appear large, and the education of too high an order, these objections
will vanish when it is remembered that lads are not acceptable on board
merchant ships until they are 15-16, because they are of little use, and
give trouble; and yet, as has been already stated, if not attracted to
the Navigation schools at the age of 12-13, and induced to remain in
attendance on the classes until they are 15-16, they will be drawn into
some other profession.</p>

<p>The course of instruction which is adopted must necessarily therefore
be sufficiently comprehensive to extend over <i>three</i> years, and at
the same time continue to the last to be specialty adapted to conduce
towards the boy’s success in his profession.</p>

<p>The subjects which appear to be suitable for boys destined for the
nautical profession and retained under instruction from 12-13 to 15-16
are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>&nbsp; * (1.) Reading and writing from dictation.</p>
<p>&nbsp; * (2.) First four rules of arithmetic.</p>
<p>&nbsp; * (3.) Grammar.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; (4.) A complete course of arithmetic.</p>

propositions in Book IV.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; (7.) Trigonometry, plane and spherical.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; (8.) Navigation.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; (9.) Nautical astronomy, including lunar double alt.
and Sumner’s method.</p>
<p>&nbsp; (10.) Practical use of the instruments used at sea.</p>
<p><span class = "linegroup">&nbsp; (11.) Geography, descriptive,<br>

<p>&nbsp; (13.) Chart drawing; surveying.</p>
<p>&nbsp; (14.) Free-hand drawing.</p>
<p>* (15.) History, particularly Scripture History and English
History.</p>
<p>* (16.) Letter writing; book-keeping.</p>
<p>&nbsp; (17.) Mechanics and steam-engine.</p>
<p>&nbsp; (18.) Magnetism and electricity in relation to ships.</p>
<p>&nbsp; (19.) Laws of storms and tides.</p>
<p>&nbsp; (20.) Knowledge of the code of signals.</p>
<p>&nbsp; (21.) Mercantile laws and usages, as far as is necessary for
the master of a merchant ship.</p>
<p>&nbsp; (22.) Gymnastics.</p>

<p class = "tablefoot">
* The boys are expected to be proficient in these subjects before entry,
and they need only be taken up in the way of review.</p>
</div>

<p>The above subjects are taught in the Navigation School at Hull.</p>

<p class = "inhead">II. <i>A Navigation School should provide a good
supply of apparatus, viz., instruments, books, maps, slates, &amp;c.
without any charge to the pupils.</i></p>

<p>In Ireland, where a class of Navigation Schools has been established
as part of the system of National Education, a very liberal supply of
sextants, books, maps, &amp;c., is given to each school by the Board of
Education.</p>

<p class = "inhead">III. <i>A Navigation School aided by Government
should offer valuable prizes in the shape of exhibitions, instruments,
books, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>The great difficulty we have to contend with is the reluctance on the

their children during the three years’ course.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page645" id = "page645">645</a></span>
<div class = "in-one">
<p>Exhibitions and prize-schemes should therefore be established on the
most liberal footing.</p>

<p>Prizes had been awarded by the Department in only two or three
instances before my tour of visits.</p>

<p>(<i>a.</i>) I beg to suggest that <i>prizes</i> be awarded, when
deserved, at all the schools every half year.</p>

<p>The prizes to consist of sextants, watches, instruments, books,
&amp;c. The future prizes to be placed at the commencement of the
half-year under the charge of the local committee, to be exposed in the
schoolroom in a case with a glass lid or cover. (The half-yearly value
of the prizes to be about 15<i>l.</i>); the prizes to be fairly and
openly competed for.</p>

<p>A very limited number of sextants should be given away, not more than
one each half-year among all the schools. The prizes not to be awarded
except on the most satisfactory proof of the lad’s sufficient
proficiency.</p>

<p>(<i>b.</i>) I beg to suggest that <i>exhibitions</i> be established
on the following scale, viz., at the rate of twelve for a school giving
instruction to 100 boys, or one to every eight boys, and be awarded at
all the schools every half-year.</p>

<p>The boys after the examination to be divided in the following
manner:&mdash;</p>

<p>The First Division to consist of all the boys who had attended the
Classes for a period under 6 months.</p>

<p>The Second Division to consist of all the boys who had attended the
Classes for 6, and under 12 months.</p>

<p>The Third Division to consist of all the boys who had attended the
Classes for 12, and under 18 months.</p>

<p>The Fourth Division to consist of all the boys who had attended the
Classes for 18, and under 24 months.</p>

<p>The Fifth Division to consist of all the boys who had attended the
Classes for 24, and under 30 months.</p>

<p>The Sixth Division to consist of all the boys who had attended the
Classes for 30, and under 36 months.</p>

<p>Exhibitions at the rate of one in eight boys to be given to the most
successful boys in each group.</p>

<p>The exhibitions for the 1st and 2nd Divisions to consist of remission
of fee and a donation of 6<i>d.</i> a week for ensuing half-year.</p>

<p>The exhibitions for the 3rd and 4th Divisions to consist of remission
of fee, and a donation of 1<i>s.</i> a week for ensuing half-year.</p>

<p>The exhibitions for the 5th and 6th Divisions to consist of remission
of fee, and a donation of 2<i>s.</i> a week for ensuing half-year.</p>

<p>This part of my proposal is elastic, the value of the exhibitions can
be increased if the principle is approved of, and the number may be
extended even to offering an exhibition to every boy attaining a certain
degree of proficiency in the studies of the school.</p>

<p>The chief merits of this plan are (1.) that as all the exhibitions
are thrown open for competition every half-year, the spirit of emulation
is constantly kept alive; it is notorious that the attainment of an
exhibition or scholarship which will be held throughout a student’s
career is often the prelude to idleness. (2.) That exhibitions are
placed within the reach of the youngest boys.</p>

<p>The examination to decide on the exhibitions and prizes should take
place at the end of the half-year. The questions to be sent from the
Department, and the answers to be sealed up in the presence of the boys,
and sent to the Department on the evening of the examination day. The
prizes and exhibitions should be awarded at the commencement of the next
half-year. As the examination should not, if possible, extend over more
than one day, the Department might make a selection from among the
subjects taught. As the inspector can not be present, one or more of the
local committee should remain in the school during each examination.</p>

<p>The result of each examination should be allowed to be published in
the local papers; competition will then be created among the various
schools at the seaport, who will view with great interest the position
of their boys on the examination list.</p>
</div>

<p>Capt. Ryder suggests (1.) that each boy who holds an exhibition or
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page646" id = "page646">646</a></span>
gains prizes, have the fact engrossed on a <i>vellum certificate</i>,
and receive a <i>medal</i> or <i>badge</i>. (2.) That all graduates of
the school who bring a good character from their captain or shipowner,
for one year after leaving the school, receive one pound from the funds
of the school. (3.) That shipowners and the Admiralty be induced to look
first to the Navigation schools for their apprentices, and that they
open to competition among the prize boys of the schools, any choice
places in their gift. (4.) That officers and masters of ships, and
public men interested in nautical matters be invited to visit the
schools.</p>

<p class = "inhead">IV. <i>A Navigation School should provide an ample
Educational Staff, whose income should be sufficient, and a certain
portion of it fixed, and whose energies should be mainly directed to the
Education of the Boys.</i></p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>The educational staff, as a general rule, is very insufficient, owing
to a school for adults having been generally established in connexion
with the school for boys.<a class = "tag" name = "tag8_7" id = "tag8_7"
href = "#note8_7">7</a> This course was adopted chiefly for economical
reasons, it being intended that the large fees from the adult class
should pay the greater proportion of the expense of the school; but it
has resulted in the boys’ school being most seriously injured, as
follows, without any compensating advantages.</p>

<p>The boys who pay fees, from 6<i>d.</i> to 1<i>s.</i> a week, are
constantly and unavoidably neglected by the head master, whose interest
it is to attend to the adults who pay from 5<i>s.</i> to 7<i>s.</i> a
week; and even if superior to that motive, the head master can not leave
the adults for more than a few minutes at a time, because, and not
unnaturally, they insist on his remaining with them.</p>
</div>

<p>A peculiarity in the mode of paying masters of Navigation Schools is
in increasing his compensation from all other sources by the payment by
the Department of an amount represented by the certificate he may hold
of his success in passing examination in certain group of subjects. The
scheme is as follows:</p>

<table class = "plaintext numbers">
<tr>
<td>Group I. Mathematics necessary to the study of navigation,</td>
<td>£5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Group II. General navigation and nautical astronomy,</td>
<td>15</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Group III. Adjustment and skillful handling of instruments,</td>
<td>5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Group IV. Physical geography,</td>
<td>10</td>

<td>Group V. Physics, mechanics, marine steam engine,</td>

<td>5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Group VIII. Chart, freehand, and mechanical drawing,</td>
<td>5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td class = "sum">£50</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>This group payment is a well devised scheme to induce masters to
improve themselves, and is applicable to teachers of every grade, and if
rightly applied, will operate as a constant stimulus to professional
improvement. But in the case of this class of schools, where there are
pupils on a varying scale of direct payment to the teacher, the teacher
will be tempted to give his particular attention to the pupils who pay
best. This can be counteracted by making the masters’ payment depend on
the proficiency of the scholars.</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>To obtain and keep the services of the zealous, intelligent, and very
superior men who alone are fit to take charge of navigation schools,
I&nbsp;believe a superannuation allowance would be at the same time the
greatest and most economical inducement.</p>

<p>I beg to suggest that at 60 years of age a navigation master be
allowed to
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page647" id = "page647">647</a></span>
retire with his group money as an allowance. This would be a great
inducement to remain in connection with the Department, and to pass in
as many groups as possible.</p>

<p>The direct inducement which I propose to give to the educational
staff to bring their schools up to the highest state of efficiency is a
payment in money, and I have been induced to propose this from the sense
of the paramount advantage derived in any undertaking from making it the
direct pecuniary interest of agents to act up to their instructions.</p>

<p>I propose that every head master, every assistant master and every
pupil-teacher employed in teaching the boys shall receive a sum of money
in addition to his fixed salary and his group money to depend on and
vary with the success of the school at the half-yearly examinations. The
mode by which I propose to estimate the amount of this payment will be
detailed further on, when I speak of inspections.</p>

<p>It consists of a sliding scale of payment, so contrived that it is
the direct pecuniary interest of the head master to bring all his boys
up to the highest state of proficiency, and also the direct pecuniary
interest of all the educational staff to refrain from forcing on the
clever boys, if by so doing they neglect the duller boys, and also to
refrain from drawing the boys into the upper and more showy subjects to
the neglect of the lower, more elementary, but more important subjects,
errors commonly and but too justly ascribed to schoolmasters in their
endeavors to give to their schools the appearance of high
efficiency.</p>

<p>I am aware that the sliding scale of payment which I propose has the
demerit of novelty.</p>

<p>The Committee of Council, fully alive to the advantage of a sliding
scale, have provided that, in the primary schools, the master’s pay
shall depend on and vary with the school pence and the capitation grant
(a&nbsp;grant which is made to depend upon the attendance of the
children,) in the art schools it is made to depend on and vary with the
number of prizes won by the students.</p>

<p>The disadvantage of the former plan is that the sliding scale, being
made to depend upon mere numerical attendance, both particular
proficiency and general proficiency are ignored.</p>

<p>The disadvantage of the latter is that it is made the master’s direct
pecuniary interest to force on the clever boys to the neglect of the
dull boys, while general proficiency and numerical attendance are
ignored.</p>

<p>There are doubtless good reasons why these very different plans
should have been adopted in primary and art schools.</p>

<p>In the scheme of varying payment which I propose for navigation
schools, both the general proficiency of the school and the numerical
attendance of the scholars are made the measures of the masters’
emoluments, while the proficiency of individual boys is fostered by
prizes and exhibitions.</p>
</div>

<p class = "inhead">V. <i>The Masters of Navigation Schools should
display great intelligence and aptitude for teaching, should be
intimately acquainted with the best methods of instruction, and be
zealous in the performance of their duties.</i></p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>As a general rule I have found the masters intelligent and apt to
teach. The majority of them have enjoyed the privilege of an education
at Greenwich under Mr. Riddle.</p>

<p>It is important that the masters should be drawn from some normal
school; Greenwich school appears admirably adapted for such purpose. To
draw a large supply of masters from that school, and retain their
services, the position of the masters in a pecuniary point of view must
in my opinion be improved. But if this is done an engagement should be
entered into to remain as a navigation schoolmaster for a certain time,
and after that, not to leave without at least two months’ warning.</p>
</div>

<p>The position of assistants should be open to all persons whose
credentials previously received, as to good character, proficiency in
all the subjects taught in this class of schools, and required for the
place, are satisfactory. The examination should be public, and the
results published. The vacancies among the head masters should be open
to competition among the assistant masters.</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>Exercise at gymnastics is most beneficial to the boys’ health, and
confirms them in their choice of the naval profession. The lads when
they go to sea are much more useful aloft if they have acquired the
agility and daring which can alone be gained by gymnastic exercises.</p>

<p>One of the causes of the rapid deterioration in the physique of our
sailors is the diminution of work aloft consequent on the introduction
of steam.</p>
</div>

<p class = "inhead">VIII. <i>The Fees in a Navigation School should be
carefully adjusted.</i></p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>A carefully adjusted scheme of fees from 1<i>d.</i> to 1<i>s.</i> per
week will not exclude by their amount any poor boys whom we might wish
to admit, or to repel by their insignificance those parents who would
attach no value to that which cost them little.</p>

<p>The larger portion of the fees, after deducting a certain fixed sum,
or a certain definite proportion of them for local expenses, will stand
in the school accounts to the credit of the local committee, and will be
expended from time to time, with the consent of the Department, in
paying the masters’ salaries, the boys’ exhibition money, &amp;c.</p>

<p>In some seaports, where there is a pertinacious disinclination on the
part of the parents of the boys to their going to sea, I&nbsp;have
suggested to the committee the undertaking to return all or a portion of
the school fees of any boy who has passed above a certain mark, on proof
being received that the boy has sailed. This would in many cases act
both on parent and child as a great inducement to the boy to go to
sea.</p>
</div>

<p class = "inhead">IX. <i>Navigation Schools should be periodically
inspected and reported on.</i></p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>Inspection to be really valuable should be thorough. Now the subjects
in which it is proposed that the boys shall be taught at the Navigation
School are very numerous, and none of them should, if possible, be
allowed to escape the notice of the inspector and the test of
examination.</p>

<p>I propose that there shall be two examinations every half-year, (1)
the general examination, to measure the progress and proficiency of the
navigation classes, and the payment to be made to the educational staff;
(2) the special competitive examination for prizes and exhibitions. The
first will be held in the course of the half-year, in the presence of
the inspector and master, the answers, however, to be looked over and
valued in London. The second will be held at the close of the half-year,
in the presence of the master and of one or more of the local committee.
It will be entirely a written examination, the questions to be sent from
the Department. To prevent any suspicion of unfair treatment, the
examination books should, after each examination, be sealed up at the
close of the day, in the presence of the boys, and sent to London. The
prizes and prize studentships will be awarded when the school meets
again, at the commencement of the next half-year. The answers will be
valued in London, by a person appointed for that special purpose. The
practice I have adopted is to give full numbers for an accurate answer,
half numbers for an answer which, though inaccurate, shows
intelligence.</p>

<p>The inspector who conducts the general examination should have with
him various papers of questions of equal value on each subject, so as to
diminish the possibility of information as to the questions set at the
examination being communicated from one school to the other. The masters
have a direct pecuniary interest in preventing any information being
sent to the other schools.</p>

<p>I suggest that the general examination, to ascertain the amount of
examination money, be conducted in the following manner:</p>

<p>The school to be arranged previous to the arrival of the inspector,
in five classes, each class separated from the other as far as the
arrangements of the school will admit, and the five classes to be so
composed as to be about equal, both in average and collective
intelligence. No difficulty is experienced by the masters in doing
this.</p>

<p>The number won by the boys in a class in a particular subject will be
added together and divided by the number of boys in the class; the
result will be the mean number for that subject for that class, and the
classes being equal, that number will be a measure of the proficiency of
the school in that subject. The
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page649" id = "page649">649</a></span>
number of boys in the school multiplied by the sum of the mean numbers
will be the number which will determine the sum of money to be
apportioned to that school, and divided among the educational staff.</p>

<p>I propose that a sum of money, at the discretion of the Department,
be divided<a class = "tag" name = "tag8_8" id = "tag8_8" href =
"#note8_8">8</a> once a year among the schools, in the ratio of the
numbers obtained as above, and that notice be given to them to that
effect at the commencement of each year, naming the total sum.
I&nbsp;propose that the sum won by the school should be divided among
the educational staff in the following proportions:&mdash;</p>

<table class = "plaintext numbers">
<tr>
<td>Head Master 5 shares, but total not to exceed</td>
<td>£30</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Assistant Masters, each 2 shares, but total not to exceed</td>
<td>12</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Pupil-Teachers, each 1 share, but total not to exceed</td>
<td>6</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>As every progressive step made by the dullest boy who attends the
classes tells on the gross number, and through it on the pecuniary gain
of the whole staff, the staff will have no temptation to neglect, but on
the contrary, every inducement to push on the dull boys, and as
proficiency in the lower subjects counts as much as proficiency in the
highest the common fault of neglecting the low subjects would evidently
diminish very much the profits of the staff, and will therefore be
prevented.</p>

<p>I consider this sliding scale would be preferable to paying the
master a certain sum for every prize won in the school, which is a
direct temptation and inducement to him to select from time to time the
most promising boys, and put them under pressure to make prize boys of
them, neglecting the dull boys of the same standing who can not on that
system of reward be productive of any benefit. The collateral advantages
of this system.</p>

<p>(1.) It becomes the direct personal interest of the staff to retain
the boys as long as possible, in order that at each examination, there
shall be as many boys as possible well advanced in all the subjects.</p>

<p>(2.) That it becomes their direct personal interest, to select from
among the boys presenting them selves for entry, those that are most
advanced in the elementary subjects, so that their backwardness may
diminish the mean numbers as little as possible.</p>

<p>(3.) That it becomes their direct personal interest to work the
school with as few masters as possible, as thereby their individual
gains are larger.</p>

<p>(4.) Competition is created among the Navigation schools and their
educational staffs. The result of each examination should be allowed to
be published in the local papers, and the results of the examinations at
all the Navigation schools should be made known at each school.</p>

<p>(5.) The inspector and the Department can see at a glance whether any
Navigation school has neglected any subject. The masters could not evade
the rigor of this test by any artifice.</p>

<p>(6.) The boys will be induced generally to enter into the spirit of
the competition, which will have the best effect. A&nbsp;few only can
win the prizes and exhibitions, but all can contribute by their
exertions to the comparative success of their school.</p>

<p>(7.) The local committee and the neighborhood would enter into the
spirit of the struggle.</p>

<p>The Trinity Board at Hull gives to 80 boys in the Navigation school a

that it be made imperative that the register be strictly kept in all the
schools, and that the following practice be universal instead of
partial, viz., that any boy arriving late is expected to produce a
written authority from the master of his school or his parents for his
absence. Prizes for good attendance have been found very useful in
primary schools. I&nbsp;beg to suggest one prize of 10<i>s.</i>, three
of 5<i>s.</i>, and five of 1<i>s.</i> every half-year, or 3<i>l.</i> a

<p class = "heading"><i>Obstacles to the success of Navigation
Schools.</i></p>

<p>The principal obstacles in the way of success, in addition to the
inefficiency of the schools, the absence of prizes, &amp;c., are three
in number.</p>

<p>It is my firm belief that if the Department assist liberally the
establishment of navigation schools, placing them on a proper footing,
and stating that they are schools established for the sole purpose of
giving special instruction in scientific subjects to boys intended for
the Royal Navy and the Commercial Marine, these three obstacles will
gradually vanish. They are,&mdash;</p>

<p class = "heading">(I.) <i>A disinclination on the part of shipowners
to enter boys.</i></p>

<p>In reply to my inquiries the owners of steamers stated, “We don’t
want boys, who eat as much as men, are of very little use, and give a
great deal of trouble; we want <ins class = "correction"
title = "close quote missing">men.”</ins></p>

<p>Steam having superseded the use of sails to a great extent, boys, who
in sailing vessels are invaluable for light work aloft, are not valued
in steamers.</p>

<p>Many of the sailors, so-called, that we find in steamers differ very
little from landsmen, except that they are not sea-sick, they can take
the wheel and pull an oar. To all the valuable qualities of a true
sailor, which were developed by and almost entirely due to his work
aloft, viz., agility, readiness of resource, indifference to all danger
that may be escaped by bodily activity, as distinct from that solid
courage which all Englishmen possess, the steam sailor can lay slight
claim.</p>

<p>In the Royal Navy we want the superior class of sailors, and if
possible those alone. The partial substitution of steam for sails, while
it has injured our own sailors has, in the same way and for the same
reason, injured those in the commercial marine, on whose aid and support
we may at any time be thrown for a supply of seamen.</p>

<p>It is most important, therefore, that every impulse should be given
to keep up in the commercial navy both the quantity and quality of the
seamen; it is much to be regretted, therefore, that the same
disinclination to take boys, although fortunately in a less degree,
exists among the shipowners of sailing vessels.</p>

<p>Lads enter on board merchant ships, some as apprentices, some as
boys.</p>

<p>In the employment of the larger shipowners apprenticeships are highly
valued.<a class = "tag" name = "tag8_9" id = "tag8_9" href =
"#note8_9">9</a> The proportion of apprentices to tonnage at present is
about 1 to 200 tons. Before the repeal of the navigation laws, it was by
Act of Parliament 1 to every 100 tons.</p>

<p>The disinclination to enter boys will, I believe, gradually vanish
when the attention of the shipowners, as a body, is attracted to the
valuable class of boys who will attend the Navigation schools, for they
will be induced to reflect, that although at first sight it may appear
to be more economical to enter no boys or
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page651" id = "page651">651</a></span>
apprentices, or a very few only, and those at very low wages,<a class =
"tag" name = "tag8_10" id = "tag8_10" href = "#note8_10">10</a> yet that
by so doing they are contributing indirectly, but yet surely and
certainly, to the deterioration of the whole class of seamen, and to the
ultimate injury of the ship-owning interest.</p>

<p class = "heading">(II.) <i>A disinclination on the part of parents to
send their boys to sea.</i></p>

<p>While sailors are, what they frequently are at present, not the most
moral or respectable members of society, it is probable and natural that
many parents would regret their sons’ choice of the sea as a
profession.</p>

<p>But as sailors and masters improve by the aid of navigation schools,
where they will be instructed in their youth, and are received in
sailors’ homes at every port where their vessels touch, this class of
objections will gradually become obsolete; and the profession of the
sailor will take its proper place by that of the high skilled mechanic
as one of the noblest professions a working man’s son can adopt, being
also one of the highest paid; 3<i>l.</i> and 4<i>l.</i> a month besides
victuals and medical attendance being the not uncommon emoluments of a
merchant seaman. Moreover, the profession of a sailor, if he is a steady
man, may be rendered both healthy, improving, and entertaining, and acts
most beneficially on the character and temper. Steam and science are
rapidly diminishing the longest voyages, and long periods of absence,
one of the not unnatural objections of a parent, are becoming the
exception instead of the rule.</p>

<p>The wish to go to sea is implanted by Providence, doubtless for the
wisest purposes, in large numbers of the boys of these islands,
frequently in those who have never seen the sea. Those parents,
ministers, or schoolmasters who take upon themselves to thwart this
natural and laudable wish, going the length, as they frequently do, of
treating the boy’s desire, as an evidence of a vagabond and depraved
taste, may be fairly charged with the responsibility of the boy’s
immoral and depraved life, if such unfortunately is the result of his
going to sea, for his naval career is probably commenced by running away
from home, and he thus severs all those domestic ties which conduce so
much to the preservation of purity of life and manners.</p>

<p>This conduct on the part of parents should be deprecated by every one
who has the best interests of his country at heart.</p>

<p>Every respectable and well conducted boy who desires to go to sea
should be aided and assisted to do so, and this course should be
systematically adopted throughout the country. The Government, by the
support of navigation schools, show their opinion on this subject. It
only remains for the schools to be put on a proper and liberal footing,
worthy of the Government and of the object which they are intended to
serve. When this is done, the profession of the sailor will be rescued
in the minds of the lower classes from all the odium which at present
surrounds it.</p>

<p class = "heading">(III.) <i>A disinclination on the part of boys to
go to sea.</i></p>

<p>This disinclination exists in some ports and not in others; it will
decrease wherever it exists when Navigation schools, established on a
liberal footing, offering the inducements I have suggested, are placed
near the docks in every seaport town of any size or importance. It is
advisable that the schools should be so placed that the boys can when
out of the school play about among the shipping, witness and long to
imitate the evolutions of the sailors aloft, &amp;c.</p>
</div>

<span class = "pagenum">

<div class = "in-one">
<p>An attractive evening class will have to be established for the
instruction of boys who have to work for their livelihood during the
day, and for apprentices. I have proposed that half the fees be given to
the educational staff, to insure their taking a direct pecuniary
interest in the evening class.</p>

<p>In concluding this report, I wish to state, that I am fully impressed
with the great benefit that the establishment of good Navigation schools
would confer directly on the Royal Navy, the Commercial Marine, and the
country; and that I see every reason for believing, that if the schools
are placed on a proper footing, the classes will be largely attended,
and the schools will answer every purpose for which they are
established. The limited number of thirty Navigation schools, which I
have suggested, should be forthwith established, although only
professing to assist in providing a sufficient supply of educated young
men to fill up the vacancies among the masters and mates, yet can not
fail to tell with the best effect on the commercial marine generally.
For these well-educated lads, who, after leaving the Navigation schools,
have to struggle through that large body, the seamen of the commercial
marine, before they can win the prizes of their profession, must raise
the tone of the class through which they pass.</p>

<p>If the thirty schools are established, and after two or three years
are evidently working well, it will be worth considering whether more
schools of a simpler and less expensive character should not be
established to educate a sufficient number of lads fully to supply the
vacancies in the seamen class.</p>

<p>The alterations I have proposed in the mode of payment of the
educational staff are those upon which I desire to lay the most stress;
they have had but one object in view, the making it the personal
pecuniary interest of each member of the staff to devote himself
zealously to those duties, and to no other, which the Department wishes
him to perform. In individual cases, we might appeal to higher motives
than these, but in dealing with a body of men, however upright and
conscientious, I&nbsp;am firmly convinced that there is no safer course
than the appealing to the lower motive in aid of the higher.</p>
</div>

<p>The plan of payment of the teachers of navigation schools generally,
presented by Capt. Ryder, was substantially adopted by the Department
having charge of this, class of schools, in 1860, but was changed to the
following Minute in April, 1863, on the recommendation of Capt.
Donnelly, for the purpose of restricting the efforts of the teacher, and
the industry of the scholars, to the subject of Mathematics, Navigation,
Nautical Astronomy, and the Use of Instruments, leaving general

ARCHITECTURE AND ENGINEERING.</a></p>

<p>The course of instruction at the Royal College of Naval Architecture
and Marine Engineering at South Kensington was originally in subjects
the same as at Portsmouth, but after careful observation of what could
be accomplished in connection with practical instruction and observation
in the dock-yards, the subjects have been redistributed, and the number
of sessions increased.</p>

<p>The <i>first</i> year embraces mathematics, practical ship-building
(laying off work), chemistry and metals, machinery, steam and its
management, physics, drawing, and French.</p>

<p>The <i>second</i> year embraces the same subjects, with the addition
of heat, and strength of materials.</p>

<p>The <i>third</i> year includes the same subjects still further
pursued.</p>

<p>A <i>fourth</i> year was added to the course in 1868, and the whole
scheme in its details has not yet been fully tested.</p>

<p>A portion of each year is spent in the dock-yards in practical work,
under the superintendence of officers in charge of different departments
of the local service.</p>

<p>At the close of each session of theoretical study, a rigid
examination is instituted, and promotion from class to class, and final
graduation with the diploma of Associate or Fellow is awarded on the
results.</p>

<p>In 1869 there were 30 students (15 engineers and 15 shipwrights) sent
by the Admiralty, and receiving their instruction free; and 10 outside
or ordinary students (6&nbsp;engineers and 8 in naval construction), a
total of 40 students.</p>


<span class = "pagenum">

<p class = "smallhead">Schools and Practical Training for Naval
Engineers.</p>

<p>In addition to the higher theoretical instruction in Naval
Construction, Steam, and Marine Engineering, and kindred branches, at
South Kensington, and to the candidates for assistant engineers,
furnished by the numerous marine engine factories, and ocean steamers,
to which young men resort to acquire a practical knowledge of their
duties, the Admiralty have established in the dockyard schools at
Portsmouth, Devonport, and Sheerness, courses of study and practical
training, and a system of test examinations, for the express purpose of
securing a body of educated and skillful engineers, to meet the demands
of this department of the service.</p>

<p>Boys between the ages of 15 and 16, can enter their names as
applicants with the Superintendent of the dockyards, and if they can
pass the medical examination and give evidence of good character, they
are examined twice a year by the Civil Service Commissioners in
Arithmetic, including fractions, square and cube roots; Algebra,
including quadratic equations; Euclid (six books), spelling, writing,
and correct oral use of the English language, translations from the
French or Spanish language, and geography. A&nbsp;certain number,
according to the vacancies, who stand highest in the competitive
examination, are received for six years.</p>

<p>A portion of time is spent, by the boys, on their admission, in the
factories and drawing office, the foundries, the smitheries, and other
shops to acquire a general knowledge of the work done in them. They are
instructed in the parts, construction and working of marine engines and
boilers, and the practical use of the various instruments in the engine
room, including the indicator. They attend regularly for a portion of
the day the dockyard schools, and are examined twice a year by the
Director of Naval Education; and in the final examination they must gain
2,000 marks out of the 2,650 (the aggregate of the marks assigned to
each study), of which more than three-fourths must be in the properties
of steam, mechanics, hydrostatics, plain trigonometry, and good conduct
and industry, to obtain a first-class certificate of qualification. If
his knowledge of steam-machinery, and his good conduct and skill as a
workman, is certified to by the Chief Engineer, a first-class candidate
is fully qualified for the appointment of assistant engineer. The most
intelligent of this class are eligible for a four years’ additional
course in the Royal School in South Kensington, where they study seven
months in the year, the other five being spent in practical application
of principles in the drawing rooms and workshops of the dockyards.
Thirty-two students entered this school from the Dockyard Schools in
1870-71.</p>

<p>The Royal School of Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering issue
two grades of diplomas. To gain the lowest, that of <i>Associate</i>,
the candidate must obtain a certain minimum of marks in the aggregate of
all the subjects, in practical engineering; the proportions and
arrangements of engines, boilers, and propellers; strength of material;
heat and steam, as well as in arithmetic and mensuration, algebra, plane
trigonometry, elementary mechanics and hydrostatics, and engine drawing.
To obtain the second (the diploma of a <i>Fellow</i>) the candidate must
produce designs and estimates for building simple and compound engines;
calculate the power of engines and performance of vessels; strength of
material and principles of ship-construction, &amp;c., as well as pass a
satisfactory examination in higher mathematics, physics, and natural
philosophy.</p>

IN THE ROYAL NAVY.</a></h4>

<p><span class = "firstword">The</span> entrance to the Royal Navy is
now limited to boys between the ages of 15 and 17, who present
themselves at certain recruiting stations on board of Receiving ships
stationed in the principal ports of Great Britain, and who are found on
examination to be in sound health, not below a certain standard of
height, weight, and circumference of chest, of good character, and with
a rudimentary knowledge of reading, writing, and arithmetic. After
passing satisfactorily the required examination, with the written
consent of their parents and guardians they are entered and bound to Her
Majesty as sailors until they arrive at the age of twenty-eight, and
then sent to one of the five Training Ships at Devonport (<i>Impregnable
and Implacable</i>), Portsmouth (<i>St.&nbsp;Vincent</i>), Falmouth
(<i>Ganges</i>), and Portland (<i>Boscawen</i>).</p>

<p>In each Training Ship the boys are divided into two classes&mdash;the
First and Second. The First class is the upper division, into which
those pass who have been twelve months on board. Here they receive
7<i>d.</i> per day (instead of 6<i>d.</i> in the Second), and if they
have passed a satisfactory examination in seamanship, gunnery, and
school work, they wear a badge, and are called Badge Boys, and enjoy the
privileges of a Petty Officer,&mdash;extra liberty on shore and
exemption from dirty work, as well as increased pay.</p>

<p>The work on board of a Training Ship, consists of (1.) School duties,
and (2.) Instruction and training in the practical work of a sea-going
vessel.</p>

<p>(1.) The school work is conducted by the Head-master and his
assistants, under the general control of the Chaplain and Naval
Instructor. The boys are put into four divisions, irrespective of the
classification of First and Second, which has reference to the time they
have been on board. Having a knowledge of reading and writing when they
enter, they are taught arithmetic and geography, and become quite expert
in elementary studies. Each division is subjected to a searching
examination four times a year, by the Captain, and twice a year by the
Inspector of Navy Schools, who reports direct to the Admiralty.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page656" id = "page656">656</a></span>
<p>(2.) The Training work, includes all branches of the service required
of a sailor, and a familiarity with every part of the vessel and her
rigging; the names and uses of the masts and yards; knotting and
splicing; the use of the helm and needle; the compass; all the various
niceties of rigging; the way to reef and furl; to make, shorten, and
shift sails; and the meaning of the various words of command. To go
through with quickness and precision all these various subjects, the
boys are divided into sections, each under a regular teacher. The
lessons are short, but frequent, and the repetition is continued till
the right way becomes a habit. A&nbsp;portion of the boys are taught
flags, and the various systems of signaling. All are taught swimming,
and how to rescue a man overboard, before they go to sea. To perfect the
boys in rowing, sailing, and managing boats, a number of different
descriptions is attached to each Training Ship. A&nbsp;Brig is also
provided which is placed under the command of a lieutenant, to cruise
daily with a party of boys, who perform all the work, under an
experienced sailor. Those who have been at school for six months are
sent off for two or three weeks at a time to get accustomed to real sea
work. After an experience of two months in a Brig, the boys return to
the Training Ship for further drill as a preparation for sea service on
board of naval vessels.</p>

<p>Boys who show an aptitude for the use of tools are formed into a
special class to be trained for ship-carpentering. And to give the
practical knowledge, a small ship (the <i>Circe</i>) is fitted up as a
workshop, and is attached to the <i>Impregnable</i>, at Devonport.</p>

<p>The training of the British sailor is not limited to seamanship, but
each boy is now conducted with great attention through a complete course
of gunnery instruction. This course is divided into four sections.</p>

<div class = "inlist">
<p>1. The Handspike drill, and manning boats’ sides.</p>
<p>2. Pointing, sponging and loading. Rifle drill.</p>
<p>3. Pointing, dismounting and mounting. Sword Exercise.</p>
<p>4. Independent firing; quick and broadside firing; shifting,
breechings, trucks, and trigger lines, bow and quarter firing; and
securing a lower deck gun.</p>
</div>

<p>On leaving a Training Ship about half the boys go through a course of
Practical Gunnery, to enable them to aim and accustom them to firing
shot and shell, on board of a ship specially fitted up for their
use.</p>

<p>In few schools of any grade is the occupation of the pupils more
incessant, but the routine is so diversified, that the lads are in high
health and spirits during their entire training.</p>

DESTITUTE CHILDREN IN SEAPORTS</a></h4>

<p><span class = "firstword">In</span> 1856 the frigate <i>Akbar</i> was
handed over by the Admiralty to a Board of Managers in Liverpool, and in
1858, the frigate <i>Venus</i>, to the Marine Society in London, to be
fitted up and occupied by a class of boys, who were found hanging about
the docks, and were fit candidates for police and reformatory treatment.
In these ships successive classes of lads&mdash;in the former an average
of 70, and in the latter, of 140, each year have received the ordinary
elementary school instruction, and in addition, have been trained to the
ordinary routine of a seaman’s life. In due time a majority of them,
rescued from bad influences, and lifted on to a higher plane of
intelligence, have been put on board of merchant vessels, to work their
way up into positions of good pay and responsibility.</p>

<p>In 1870 the Admiralty turned over to a Board of Management (charged
by the Poor Law with providing schooling for destitute and pauper
children) in the Forest Gate District, composed of three of the eastern
parishes of London, a fine wooden man-of-war, the <i>Goliath</i>, of 84
guns, rendered powerless for the service, by the progress of modern
naval construction. The ship was fitted up as a nautical and industrial
school, at a cost trifling compared with that of a new building, site,
and equipment for the same number, and, with its complement of 400 lads
born to poverty and almost predestined to vice and crime, anchored off
Gravesend. Fortunate in its superintendent, Captain Bourchier, of the
Royal Navy, and his staff of industrial and book instruction, these lads
(increased during the year to 450) have been subjected to a daily
nautical drill and school course, which give great satisfaction.</p>

<p>From an official statement published in the London Times (Oct. 11,
1871), it appears that out of 449 boys received on board since the
<i>Goliath</i> took up her station, 16 have gone into the Royal Navy,
and in a few weeks 40 others will be in readiness; 13 have gone to sea
in merchant ships, and more berths are promised shortly; 25 have found
desirable situations on shore or been discharged to their friends.
Besides the regular elementary school studies in which all engage for
four hours, and seamanship which
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page658" id = "page658">658</a></span>
is taught to all, 115 are under instruction in the bands, of which there
are four on board, in addition to a drum and fife band. There are 160
treble and second singers; and concerts, vocal and instrumental, are
given by the young performers. For young musicians there is a demand in
the army, and a list of 30 adepts have been sent to the Horse Guards.
There is a swimming bath attached, and 185 have been taught to swim. Out
of a fund raised by subscription, prizes are given, the first
distribution of which is thus described:</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>The prizes, of which about 100 were given away&mdash;and Captain
Bourchier said he wished heartily that he had a prize for every boy, for
“there was not one black sheep among them”&mdash;were awarded according
to a system calculated to stimulate the better feelings as well as the
intelligence of the boys. Thus, while there were prizes for seamanship,
for smartness aloft, for the best sail-makers, best coxswains of boats,
best tailors, shoemakers, carpenters, painters, buglers, &amp;c., there
were also prizes for the best swimmers, the best captain of messes, for
the boys who kept their clothes or band instruments in the best order,
one for the boy who had attended most carefully to the sick, and two for
the most popular boys in the ship. The latter prizes had been awarded
according to a species of informal and unconscious <i>plébiscite</i> on
the part of the boys themselves. There were five “popular boys”
nominated; for one of these&mdash;a small, dark, round-faced
urchin&mdash;every boy in the ship voted; the next on the list had a
little over 50 per cent. of the crew in his favor; and if names be any
guide to nationality both these boys ought to hail from the sister
island. To five of the boys silver medals were given for special good
conduct, and these enjoyed the distinction of standing in the front row
and having their honors fastened on by Miss Bourchier, daughter of the
Captain Superintendent, the general distribution of books being made by
Mr. Brushfield, chairman of the Board of Managers. As the little fellows
came up to the table it was impossible not to remark what a difference
existed between recent arrivals in the school and those who had been a
few months or even a few weeks on board the <i>Goliath</i>. The school
records show that, though commonly feeble and stunted in growth when
they embark, numbers of them have since grown two and three inches in
height, and as much as two inches round the chest. At Gravesend mariners
know that the salt water mingles with the fresh; the process is silent,
but not the less real. And in the <i>Goliath</i>, as in the tide itself,
a change may be traced, working quietly but just as surely, in the
<i>physique</i> and characters of the boys on board. The constraint,
depression, and helplessness lurking in all pauper boys lifts and melts
away by little and little. In its place come the frankness, courage, and
love of adventure natural to English boys who live near the sea. Every
thing on board encourages a cheerful, self-reliant tone: the music, good
food, good air, alternate hours of work and play, care, and strict
discipline&mdash;these are the elements in the midst of which they live.
The boys make every thing for themselves. Even the neat Hussar uniform
in which band No. 1 plays on the quarter-deck has been cut out and made
on board. The form of punishment held in most awe is to be forbidden to
row in the boats. Moreover, they one and all feel that they have a
future. Taking into account the advantages, physical and educational,
which the boys receive, it would not be placing too high a value upon
the training in the <i>Goliath</i> to estimate it in the case of each
boy at 50<i>l.</i> a year. Yet the actual charge made to other unions is
6s. 6d. a week.</p>
</div>

<p>The editorial notice of this enterprise concludes as follows:</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>Thus, beside the regular supply of trained sailor boys who may be
expected to take to the navy&mdash;we are told the punishment most
dreaded on board the <i>Goliath</i> is being forbidden to row in the
boats&mdash;there will be a considerable residue brought up to steady
work on shore, to skilled labor and occupations which ought to secure
them in after life a decent subsistence, and a position far above the
slough of hopeless and helpless poverty in which they were born.</p>

<p class = "smallhead">INTRODUCTION.</p>

<p><span class = "firstword">The</span> necessities of the maritime
service in France, public and private, military and commercial, have
created a system, or at least a series of special schools for children
whose parents are occupied on the sea, or youths preparing for the
exigencies of naval affairs, several of which we will proceed to
describe, with the aid of official documents,<a class = "tag" name =
"tag8_11" id = "tag8_11" href = "#note8_11">11</a> without reference to
the chronological order in which they have been instituted. The system
includes</p>

<p>&nbsp; 1. Nautical School for the Orphans of Sailors.</p>
<p>&nbsp; 2. The Inflexible and other School-ships.</p>
<p>&nbsp; 3. Naval Apprentice Schools at the government naval

<p>&nbsp; 6. Naval Drawing School.</p>

<p>10. School of Marine Artillery.</p>
<p>11. School of Hydrography.</p>
<p>12. Naval School of Medicine and Pharmacy.</p>

<p>In addition to the schools above enumerated, several of which will be
described in detail, the French government has now under consideration
the establishment at Paris of a Central School of Commerce and
Navigation. The instruction, while it will be special, will not be
technical, and will be designed for young persons who propose to enter
either the military or mercantile marine, leaving the practical details
of the particular branch of the service to be acquired elsewhere.</p>

<p>A system of maritime conscription for recruiting the navy, and strict
regulations requiring special instruction in masters and mates of all
mercantile vessels, are in force in France.</p>

<p>Formerly, when the children of sailors were obliged at the age of
seven to leave the asylums (<i>salles d’asile</i>,) which are open to
them with such liberality, they had to stay for six years in the primary
schools before, they were admitted to the “school for young sailors”
(<i>école des mousses</i>,) where their professional education
commenced. This state of things, entirely satisfactory when the child
belongs to a family, is different when it is an orphan. Then there is a
void to be filled.</p>

<p>An imperial decree, published Nov. 15th, 1862, at the suggestion of
the Marquis of Chasseloup Laubat, provides for this want by furnishing
at Brest an institution for the orphans of the navy, and placing it
under the especial protection of Her Majesty, the Empress. Vice-Admiral,
Count de Gueydon, gave all his care to the organization of this especial
school, which was intended to gather the orphans of seamen, to place
them under the protection of the navy, to educate and instruct them that
they might follow in the steps of their fathers. They were placed under
the supervision of lieutenant Picard of the navy. Their general
instruction was confided to the <i>Brothers of the Christian
Schools</i>, and the “Daughters of Wisdom” (<i>filles de la sagesse</i>)
were intrusted with all the cares which such young children require.</p>

<p>We have nothing to say in this place of the excellent primary
instruction given in this school, and will only notice briefly the
special or professional instruction, which is imparted in a military
style by divisions, subdivisions, companies, sections, squads commanded
by masters, second masters, quarter-masters, and naval instructors.
There are three sizes (the low, middle, and high,) each of which is
commanded by a pupil.</p>

<p>The lessons which they receive consist of instruction in the
management of sails, sailor’s practice, (<i>école de matelotage</i>,)the
whistle, fife and drum, rowing, swimming, military practice,
gun-practice, bayonet-practice, bats, <i>eillon</i>-drill, principles of
music, gymnastics, and boxing. There is likewise given to them a
physical and military education, which <ins class = "correction" title =
"spelling unchanged">developes</ins> their strength and gives them the
ability to study more closely.</p>

<p>On the 1st of January, 1867, there were in the school 415 pupils.
Most of them are sent to the Seamen’s School (<i>école des mousses</i>,)
when they have attained the thirteenth year of their age; those who are
not considered fit to serve in the navy are struck off the lists and
returned to their families.</p>

<p>For a long time the children of sailors were placed on board the
vessels of the fleet, where they lived in a state of servitude, and
frequently arrived at a mature age without being able to read or write,
while the gasket of the sailor formed characters which would not yield
to any moral suasion. It is only since 1822 that they received, before
being placed on board the vessels, an elementary and professional
instruction, and since that time the school-ship has
<span class = "pagenum">

become the principal seminary for naval officers. The children must be
at least twelve years old and their parents pledge themselves not to
take them away from the school till they have reached the age of
eighteen.</p>

<p>The school-ship, first established at Brest in 1823, was transferred
to a corvette in 1836, to a frigate in 1851, and finally, in 1861, to
the man-of-war, “<i>l’Inflexible</i>,” where it numbers at present 900
pupils from the age of 13 to 15.&nbsp;They remain here at least one and
not more than two years, and receive a primary and professional
instruction. After leaving the school they are placed on vessels of the
fleet, where they continue to be under the special superintendence of
the naval department. Even here they go through a regular course of
instruction, given by one of the officers, and have thus an opportunity
to continue the studies commenced on board the school-ship.</p>

<p>It would lead us too far here to enumerate in detail all the
exercises performed on board the <i>Inflexible</i>. It will suffice to
say that besides school instruction, the pupils are progressively
accustomed to the practice of their profession, and learn everything
which a sailor can be taught on board a vessel; the washing and cleaning
of the vessel and of their linen, the rigging of the mast, the
maneuvering of sail-boats and row-boats, which occupations fill the
morning hours. After dinner, which takes place at 11 o’clock, they go on
board two brigs, where they study and execute alone all that constitutes
the practical art of the sailor.</p>

<p>It is not to be wondered at that these young sailors on board the
<i>Inflexible</i> get a liking for their occupation. Always in the open
air, with good clothes, varied bodily exercises and abundant food, they
acquire robust health and a thorough knowledge of their profession.
Whilst two companies tack, two others go through military, exercises
with rifles or guns, taking them to pieces, lashing the pieces, and in
various ways maneuvering with the mountain howitzer, bayonet-fencing,
&amp;c. Some go to the sail-maker’s room and make hammocks. In 1857
there were selected 16 sail-makers and 20 steersmen from those in each
company who showed most aptitude and taste for these specialties. This
classification of the young sailors according to their professional
ability, has produced very excellent results.</p>

<p>More recently still (by an imperial edict of Aug. 11, 1868,) a
special section of sailor apprentices has been formed on board the
“<i>Inflexible</i>” for children, who have not the required size and
strength, (<i>taille</i>;) they are received into the school as
apprentice sail-makers,
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page663" id = "page663">663</a></span>
carpenters and calkers. Pupils, after having reached the age of sixteen,
are transferred to the school-ship <i>La Bretagne</i>.</p>

<p class = "smallhead"><a name = "france_apprentice" id =
"france_apprentice" href = "#navy_france">NAVAL APPRENTICE
SCHOOLS.</a></p>

<p>There have been since 1824, in every one of the five naval stations
of France, elementary schools, intended to give to the apprentices in
the various workshops a degree of elementary knowledge, on the system of
monitorial or mutual instruction. After some years of prosperity they
were abandoned, in consequence of the great aversion then generally
manifested against this method. The only one that remained was the
school at Rochefort, which was under the superintendence of the Brothers
of the Christian Schools. But in 1828 and 1829, under the ministry of
Martignac, the Baronet Hyde de Neuville ordered their reëstablishment.
Every one of these schools organized itself in its own way, and it was
only in 1851 that a decree of April 7th prescribes uniform
regulations.</p>

<p>We have nothing to say here on these apprentice-schools, which are
simply primary schools for adults, to which are added special schools
for rowing. Their professional instruction is given in the various
workshops of the port, to which they have been assigned; the apprentice
school has had during the year 1866, 954 pupils.</p>


<p class = "smallhead"><a name = "france_boatswain" id =
"france_boatswain" href = "#navy_france">SCHOOLS OF BOATSWAINS.</a></p>

<p>The navy maintains schools called “<i>école de maistrance</i>”
(<i>maistrance</i> corps of under-officers of a ship,) where a certain
number
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page664" id = "page664">664</a></span>
of workmen from the arsenals, chosen by open competition, receive the
special theoretical instruction required for the boatswain and foremen
of the various workshops.</p>

<p>The origin of these establishments goes back as far as 1819.
A&nbsp;circular from the Secretary of the Navy, the Baronet Portal, of
Aug. 17th, decreed the establishment, at the ports of Brest, Rochefort
and Toulon, of special schools, in which a certain number of young
workmen, destined for the “board of shipmasters” (<i>maistrance</i>) and
chosen from among the most intelligent ones, should go through a
theoretical and practical course of ship-building. The same circular
contained a provisional regulation, giving the rules to be observed in
these schools. The number of pupils in each was limited to 12, of which
8 should be carpenters, 1 pulley-maker, 1 blacksmith, 1 locksmith, 1
cooper, &amp;c. These pupils should be chosen from among the most
intelligent and best-behaved apprentices and young workingmen. They must
know reading and writing, have served two years in one of the ports, and
be at least eighteen and not more than twenty years old. The supervision
of these schools was confided to a naval engineer.</p>

<p>We have just given an outline of the programme of admission required
in 1819, because it is an official indication of the state of primary
instruction at this period; but the same regulation proves that it was
too high yet, for the minister allowed, for the first two years, the
limit of age to be extended to 25 years.</p>

<p>The course of instruction which was to be given, comprised the first
elements of mathematics, elementary geometry, the first elements of
rectilinear trigonometry and the first elements of statics, &amp;c. This
course of studies was to last two years, and a system of examination and
prizes was organized.</p>

<p>It was generally supposed that such an organization would obtain
great success, and that the advantages which it presented would attract
many pupils. But such was not the <ins class = "correction" title =
"text has ‘csse’">case</ins>. The working classes at that time were very
much neglected, and there were very few who could read or write.
Moreover the working men did not receive any pay whilst attending the
school, and thirdly, there was no opportunity for these young men to
perfect themselves in the practical exercises of their profession during
the two years they studied the theory. The necessity of making some
modification became clearer every day, and this was done by a royal
decree of Feb. 9th, 1833.</p>

<p>Instead of choosing the pupils, competition was substituted, and as
the primary instruction had advanced, candidates were required
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page665" id = "page665">665</a></span>
to be able to read fluently, to write neatly and correctly, and to be
acquainted with the rudiments of arithmetic; they must be workingmen of
the first or second class, must be 21 years old and have served for
three years in some port; finally, they must furnish a certificate of
their professional capacity, given by the foreman of their workshop, and
countersigned by the director.</p>

<p>The course of instruction was to last two years, but the theoretical
studies were confined to the first year; the second year was exclusively
devoted to the practical application of the various professions of the
pupils, the number of whom was increased, the recruits coming to a great
extent from the naval ports. Brest was to receive 24, Rochefort 14, and
Toulon 14; 52 in all, instead of 36.</p>

<p>In spite of the abolition of the limit of higher age, which gave a
larger number of pupils access to the school, the recruiting of pupils
still presented great difficulties. These were partly obviated by
admitting assistant boatswains, and even boatswains, who were paid by
the day. This measure was productive of very happy results; the number
of pupils was soon increased and the studies were <ins class =
"correction" title = "text has ‘persued’">pursued</ins> with greater
vigor.</p>

<p>The republican government, likewise, devoted its attention to these
schools. A&nbsp;decree ordering a reörganization, was published April
23, 1856, and is to the present day in force. The conditions of
admission were retained and extended to workingmen of the third class;
the number of pupils assigned to each post was somewhat changed; the
course of instruction was to last two years; during the first, the
pupils spent the whole morning at the school, and during the second,
only three mornings per week. Finally, it was agreed that the pupils
were to be paid for the time which they devoted to the school, just as
if they had worked in the dockyard.</p>


<p class = "smallhead">PROGRAMME OF INSTRUCTION.</p>

<p>In order to make the scientific instruction of more practical use,
the following programme was fixed for each year.</p>

<p><i>First year.</i>&mdash;Arithmetic, logarithms, square cube roots;
2, geometry; 3, elements of descriptive geometry; 4, elements of algebra
up to equations of the second degree; 5, linear drawing; the course of
arithmetic and algebra lasted a month and a half, from 10 o’clock till
noon, instruction in drawing from 8 till 10.&nbsp;The two last months of
the year were employed in reviewing all that had been taught during the
year, and in preparing for the examination.</p>

<p><i>Second year.</i>&mdash;1, Common mechanics; 2, workshop accounts;
3, drawing. The course of mechanics and workshop accounts lasts
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page666" id = "page666">666</a></span>
two months. The half-day spent at the school is divided into three
parts; the first is occupied in drawing, and lasts two hours; the second
(either mechanics or workshop accounts) also two hours; the remainder of
the time is devoted to optional studies. When the course of mechanics
and workshop accounts is finished, the pupils are divided into two
sections; the first comprises the carpenters, and workmen of similar
rank; the second the mechanicians and workers in metal. During two
months and a half the professor of mathematics teaches the section that
works in wood the application of geometry to the drawing of working
plans, explains to them all the details of the drawing of the frame, the
stern, the bow and pieces, &amp;c. He teaches them to calculate the
<i>deplacements</i> from the centre of the keel, or metre-centre.
Finally, the pupils are taken to the molding-loft, in order to trace
there a vessel in its true dimensions under the directions of a
drawing-master. The metal-workers receive instructions from the
professors of mathematics, on the property and application of steam; the
functions of the various parts of a steam-engine; the applications of
descriptive geometry to the drawing of the different parts of the
steam-engine, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The instruction in drawing receives in these schools all the
attention which the development of naval construction demands. During
the first year the pupils learn successively shading strokes of
different thickness, simple and dotted; the construction and use of
ladders. After this preparation, which applies to all, they execute
professional drawings; the carpenters, plans of vessels after a copy;
the mechanicians, plans of steam-engines and steam-boilers, &amp;c. The
time devoted to drawing during the second year is employed by the
carpenters in drawing a fair copy of the complete furnishing material of
a vessel, the details of the masting, the capstan, the helm, &amp;c.; by
the metal-workers in drawing a fair copy of the various machines. All
these courses of instruction have been attended with satisfactory
results; most of the pupils who have not been able to draw a straight
line before entering the school, on leaving can draw in a creditable
manner the working-plan of a vessel as well as of the most complicated
machines.</p>

<p>From its foundation in 1819 till the end of 1862, the <i>Echo de
maistrance</i> at Brest has been attended by 429 pupils, viz.:</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>275 pupils actually in the service, viz.: 34 pupils; 60 workingmen;
57 assistant boatswains; 100 boatswains; 24 paid boatswains.</p>

<p>59 pupils died in the service, viz.: 5 pupils, 15 workingmen, 7
assistant boatswains, 22 boatswains; 7 paid boatswains; 1 naval
storehouse-keeper.</p>

<p>95 pupils left or were discharged.</p>
</div>

<p>To get an idea of the manner in which the pupils pass the examination
on leaving, it will be seen from the following table, which shows the
results in the school at Brest during the last five years, that the
instruction given has not been lost. The same is the case at Rochefort
and Toulon.</p>

<p class = "smallhead"><a name = "france_eng" id = "france_eng" href =
"#navy_france">SCHOOL FOR NAVAL ENGINEERS, STOKERS, etc.</a></p>

<p>Since the introduction of steam into navigation, it is indispensable
to have well-trained stokers and mechanicians, men who enjoy robust
health, great presence of mind, prudence and an inventive genius when
facing difficulties, skill in working metals, a knowledge of elementary
mathematics and its application to their labor. In order to prepare such
men, two special schools have been established by an imperial edict of
Sept. 24, 1860, one at Brest, on board the <i>Urania</i>, and another at
Toulon, on board the <i>Jena</i>. To be admitted to these schools, the
conditions must be fulfilled which are required for the various grades
in the <i>personnel</i> of a steam vessel.</p>

<p>In order to recruit these schools, all the blacksmiths, braziers and
weighers, (<i>ajusteurs</i>) who belong to the annual contingent of the
army, may be sent officially, or at their own request, to the ports of
Toulon and Brest, to be incorporated in the companies of mechanics of
the navy. Civilians are admitted by contracting a voluntary engagement
as stokers. All, however, must undergo an examination in manual labor,
to show their physical capacity.</p>

<p>The course of instruction for stokers who are candidates for the
grade of quartermaster, comprises, 1, arithmetic up to and including the
rule of three, and square roots; 2, common geometry up to and including
spherical bodies; 3, a concise knowledge of mechanics, and physics; 4,
description and classification of steam-engines for vessels; the
adjusting of their various parts, a concise knowledge of the property of
metals and their use; 5, the practical management of machines and
steam-boilers; 6, the repairing of machines.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page668" id = "page668">668</a></span>
<p>It is evident that this instruction attracts to the service of the
navy many intelligent and industrious young mechanics who would not
enter it, because, not possessing the special knowledge required, they
would not run the chance of remaining for a long time in the lowest
grade, viz.: that of working stoker, the only one to which their
attainments would allow them to aspire. In following this instruction,
however, attentively and passing their examination successfully, they
obtain the rank of pupil mechanicians, and even of quartermasters. In
continuing their studies, they can rise still higher; their schools
furnish them with the means, if they wish to become second boatswains.
To the knowledge already acquired are added: 1, arithmetical
progression; 2, the whole of planimetry; 3, theoretical mechanics and
physics; 4, theory, description, regulation, and construction of
steam-engines and steam-boilers; 5, the working and repairing of
machines. By further pursuing their studies and working diligently, they
can rise from second to first boatswain, and may ultimately obtain the
position of principal mechanician, with the rank of lieutenant on
men-of-war, and even of captain on corvettes, if they became chief
mechanicians. The following table, giving the statistics of the school
at Toulon, will show the success with which these schools have been
attended.</p>

<p class = "smallhead"><a name = "france_drawing" id = "france_drawing"
href = "#navy_france">NAVAL DRAWING SCHOOL.</a></p>

<p>An edict issued by Napoleon I, Sept. 27th, 1810, established at Brest
and Toulon, on board the <i>Duquesne</i> and the <i>Tourville</i>,
drawing-schools for those who wished to enter the naval service, where
theoretical and practical instruction was given. At the foundation
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page669" id = "page669">669</a></span>
of the naval school at Augoulême in 1816, these drawing-schools were
transferred to the shore, became less exclusive, and admitted to their
gratuitous course all young men from these two great naval stations who
wished to adopt the naval profession. They have always been very largely
attended.</p>


<p class = "smallhead"><a name = "france_navigation" id =
"france_navigation" href = "#navy_france">SCHOOLS OF NAVIGATION AND
HYDROGRAPHY.</a></p>

<p>Long before the navy had acquired any importance, maritime commerce
had been immensely developed. The coasting and ocean trade required
experienced and well-informed sailors. There were therefore in the
principal seaports, gratuitous schools of navigation, whose aim was to
disseminate theoretical knowledge. These schools were well conducted
from the year 1584, when Henry III issued the first ordinance on the
subject, by which boatswains and captains of merchant vessels had to
undergo an examination of qualifications; but opportunities of
instruction were wanting at that time, and it was reserved for Louis
XIII to fill this void.</p>

<p>During the memorable siege of La Rochelle, Cardinal Richelieu became
convinced that the knowledge of a captain, to whom the State intrusts a
merchant-vessel, ought not to be confined to the most simple rules of
the art of navigation. He consequently, in January, 1629, published a
decree, ordering the establishment of schools of hydrography, open to
all who intended to study navigation theoretically. The king himself
engaged to maintain, at his own expense, a certain number of such
schools, and encouragements were held out to all cities which would
found such schools. The professors of hydrography were detained to
assist at the examinations of captains, boatswains and coxswains.</p>

<p>Such was the origin of the first professional instruction in
navigation. Here, as in all institutions of learning, the instruction of
manhood succeeded that of youth. If the orders of Louis XIII were not as
generally executed as they deserved, they were instrumental in producing
a certain number of learned hydrographers, some of whom became the
authors of the first treatises on navigation ever published in the
French language.</p>

<p>A decree of Louis XIV, (August, 1681,) another by Louis XV,
(September 14, 1764,) and third by Louis XVI, (January 1, 1786,) show
that the ancient monarchy did not lose sight of this branch of
instruction. In the last mentioned decree, the Marquis of Castries,
Secretary of the Navy, united under one common law all these
establishments, whose organization was far from uniform. The professors
were in future chosen by competition. Two chairs of
<span class = "pagenum">

“hydrographic examiners” were created, charged with the superintendance
of the instruction, to assist at the examinations.</p>

<p>A decree of the National Assembly, which became a law, August 16th,
1791, decided that gratuitous schools of hydrography should be
established at the expense of the State, in thirty-four different
places. This decree was supplanted by others published a few years
later, further regulating the course of instruction.</p>

<p>During the wars of the first Empire, Napoleon I never forgot to
extend the benefits of French institutions wherever his armies were
victorious. To this circumstance several foreign seaports owe their
excellent schools of navigation.</p>

<p>The hydrographic instruction was completely reorganized by a royal
edict of August 7, 1825, under the ministry of Count de Chabrol. This is
still in force with but few modifications. One professor is charged with
giving instruction in each of the 42 schools of the Empire; two
examiners have charge of the general supervision of these schools, and
hold the annual examinations.</p>

<p>Instruction is gratuitous, and sailors can enter from the age of 13
upwards, but they rarely attend them before they are 22 or 23 years old.
The professors, on five days of the week, impart instruction for four
hours a day. There are two different courses; one superior and the other
elementary; the first theoretical and practical, the other essentially
practical. Wherever there is an observatory, the pupils are practiced in
observations.</p>

<p>The programme of the theoretical instruction comprises: for ocean
voyages, elements of arithmetic, algebra, geometry, trigonometry,
elements of astronomy, navigation, use of instruments and nautical
tables, elementary knowledge of steam-engines, as applied to navigation,
French composition; for the coasting-trade, elements of practical
arithmetic, geometry, practical navigation, elementary knowledge of
steam-engines, nautical calculations. The examinations are annual, and
no one is admitted to the practical examination, unless he has reached
the age of 24, and has served five years on a French vessel. It
comprises rigging, management of sails, a knowledge of coasts, currents,
tides, and gunnery. After the practical examination has been
successfully passed, the pupil must undergo the theoretical one.</p>

<p>For the results produced by these establishments, the average
attendance of the schools of navigation, and the number of sailors, who
have become captains or boatswains, we refer to the following

href = "#navy_france">THE NAVAL SCHOOL AT BREST.</a></p>

<p><span class = "firstword">Napoleon</span>, in 1810-11, established
the first naval school-ships in France, the <i>Tourville</i> being
chosen for that purpose at Brest, and the <i>Duquesne</i> at Toulon.
These schools were placed under the orders of the maritime prefects of
the two ports. In 1816, these two schools were abolished by decree, and
a royal marine college was established at Angoulême. Several other
changes took place, and in 1830 the college was replaced by a naval
school on board the <i>Orion</i>, an old 74; this vessel was succeeded
by several others, all of which have received the name of the second
school-ship, the <i>Borda</i>, named after Captain Borda, a naval
officer of great scientific and practical ability. The present ship is a
noble three-decker, pierced for 120 guns, was launched in 1847, and took
part in the Crimean war.</p>

<p>The <i>Borda</i> is stationed at Brest, and its rigging has been
reduced to that of a frigate. The forepart of the second gun-deck of the
vessel still retains something of its old character, and is provided
with six guns on each side for practice. The other parts of the vessel
have been completely altered; the decks have been cut away, so as to
form two large lecture-rooms and two school-rooms. Not only the pupils
but also their professors and most of the officers are lodged on board
the vessel. On deck are specimens of various kinds of guns in use in the
French navy, and a gymnasium. The quarter-deck, which is continued to
the mainmast, is divided, the forepart being appropriated to the pupils,
and the aft to officers.</p>

<p>Candidates are admitted to this school after a public examination,
which occurs annually. For admission to the examination the applicant
must prove his French birth&mdash;his being at least fourteen years of
age and not over seventeen years, and his having no infirmity that
disables him for marine duty.</p>

<p>The requirements for admission are a <ins class = "correction" title
= "text has ‘knowlege’">knowledge</ins> of arithmetic, algebra,
geometry, plane trigonometry, applied mathematics, natural philosophy,
chemistry, geography, the English language, drawing. The candidates must
prepare a composition in French, a translation from Latin, an exercise
in English, a numeral calculation in trigonometry, a geometrical
drawing, and an off-hand sketch of a head. There are two oral
examinations on the above studies, the second of which is not attempted
if the first, which is elementary, is unsatisfactory.</p>

<p>The commander of the <i>Borda</i> is a full captain, and the
instruction, which is practical as well as theoretical, is confided to
eleven
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page673" id = "page673">673</a></span>
professors, of whom five belong to the hydrographic department, eight
are full lieutenants, and one a principal engineer. The duties of the
five hydrographic professors are thus divided:&mdash;Two teach astronomy
and navigation, two analytical and mechanical science, and the last
natural philosophy and chemistry. The duties of the other professors are
thus arranged:&mdash;Two for literature, history and geography; two for
the English language; and two for drawing. The lieutenants direct four
courses of instruction, namely, naval architecture, the theory and
practice of managing a ship, gunnery and small arms, with practice, and
nautical calculations. The engineer professor teaches the theory and
management of steam-engines and mechanics. The other officers are a
captain of a frigate, (second in command,) a chaplain, a financial and
an administrative officer, and two medical men. Besides these, there is
a captain of gunnery and several under-officers of the marine and
artillery.</p>

<p>The school sessions commence on the first of October, and on that day
promotions of the pupils are made in the various classes. Those who have
passed two years of study in the ship are called <i>grand ancients</i>,
rank with naval aspirants of the second class, and are eligible to make
a voyage of circumnavigation in another vessel appropriated to that
purpose; pupils who have been one full year in the <i>Borda</i> are
called ancients, and the rest new boys, or in French naval language,
<i>fistots</i>. The boys have each a number, and in all the ordinary
routine of the school-ship, this takes the place of a name.</p>

<p>The elder pupils are employed as monitors over the younger, and each
of the former has one or more allotted to him, not as a fag, but as a
scholar, whom it is his duty to teach all he himself knows. It is said
that the system succeeds admirably, and that for the first few months
the instruction of the new comer is left almost entirely to his
<i>ancient</i>; the new pupil thus escapes without difficulty many
errors of discipline into which he would otherwise inevitably fall.</p>

<p>The discipline of the school is severe; the boys rise every morning,
all the year round, at five o’clock, stow away the hammocks in which
they sleep, attend prayers, and then commence their morning’s work.</p>

<p>They are well fed, having coffee or chocolate in the morning, dinner
(old style) at 12 o’clock, a lunch of bread (<i>goûter</i>) at 4.30, and
supper at 7.45, with bread <i>à discrétion</i>, and about four-tenths of
a pint of wine at each of the two principal meals.</p>

<p>The morning studies are devoted to science; those of noon to practice
with guns, or practical study, marine machinery, or drawing;
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page674" id = "page674">674</a></span>
and the evening to literature, the English language, or naval
architecture. All the studies are pursued on board, with the exception
of natural philosophy and chemistry, the professor of which has at his
command in the town the collection of instruments and chemicals, as well
as the lecture-room and laboratory of the central pharmaceutical
establishment. At times, also, the pupils are taken to visit the vessels
in process of construction, and the workshops in the arsenal, and to
practice with small arms on shore.</p>

<p>There are eight boats attached to the <i>Borda</i>, and the pupils
are practiced almost every day, and in all weathers, in rowing and
sailing, under the eye of an officer, who watches the exercises from on
board a small steam-gunboat attached to the school. The ordinary studies
of the school end between six and seven in the evening, and the pupils
turn in at nine o’clock for their eight hours’ rest.</p>

<p>Thursday and Sunday, as usual in France, are exceptional days, when,
after nautical calculations, (which are never omitted,) the elder pupils
or ancients practice with small arms on shore, and the juniors are
drilled in the use of the sword, musket, and bayonet. After this they
have six hours’ hard work in maneuvering two small corvettes, provided
for the purpose, that belonging to the ancients being a
screw-steamer.</p>

<p>The boys, as a rule, are at liberty on alternate Sundays, and the
most advanced every Sunday afternoon. This is a recent innovation; the
pupils used to be free scarcely more than once a month; but this gave
rise to much discontent and some disturbance, and the rule has,
therefore, been made less severe. In addition to this liberty, however,
all the lads are allowed to see their friends for a short period during
the exercises on shore on Sunday and Thursday mornings, and those who
are not free on Sunday are taken on shore for a change in the afternoon.
During the summer months the boys bathe in the sea.</p>

<p>A peculiar custom exists in the school&mdash;the boys are allowed to
smoke during the hour of recreation after dinner, and at certain other
times; and for this reason, that as it was found utterly impossible to
stop the practice entirely, it was deemed better to recognize it in
moderation, and thus stop its secret indulgence and the attendant danger
of fire.</p>

<p>The punishments inflicted in the school are extra drill and
confinement, either in a small cell or in a dark hole, with a regimen of
bread and water; for very grave offences, boys are dismissed or
expelled. On the other hand, the marks for good conduct are numerous;
there are several examinations in the various classes during
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page675" id = "page675">675</a></span>
the nine months of the school year, and those pupils who gain the
greatest number of marks are called <i>élèves d’élite</i>, and wear a
gold anchor on their collars, or, in the case of the first twelve, two
anchors; the pupil who has gained the largest number of marks bears the
high but merely nominal rank of first brigadier, and he who enters the
school with the greatest success at the examination is called major.
A&nbsp;general examination takes place at the end of the year, when the
ancients who pass become aspirants in the navy, and the juniors are
raised to the upper class in the school; those who fail in the
examination are either sent back to their class, or rejected as unfit
for the naval career. The first and second prizemen, on quitting the
school, receive each a quadrant in the name of the Emperor, and the
third a telescope.</p>

<p>The elder pupils have nearly three months’ holiday, but the junior
pass a month on board another vessel, the <i>Bougainville</i>, for what
is called the summer campaign. This vessel, which was constructed
specially for the school, is a screw dispatch-boat with engines of 120
horse power; the summer voyage is settled by the Minister of Marine, and
includes a visit and examination of the ports of L’Orient and Cherbourg,
touching at some remarkable points of the French coast, sometimes
casting anchor off the English coast, and sometimes running as far as
Ferrol in Galicia.</p>

<p>The <i>grand ancients</i>, when their holidays are over, that is to
say on the first of October, join the <i>Jean Bart</i>, which makes an
annual voyage of several months’ duration. This boat was built in 1852
and made its first voyage of this kind in 1864-5.&nbsp;She is an 80-gun
ship, of the mixed class, having engines of 450 nominal horse-power. In
August of the present year she will have completed her fourth and last
voyage of circumnavigation, another vessel, the <i>Donawert</i>, now
being prepared to succeed her. The upper gun-deck of the <i>Jean
Bart</i> is disarmed, and converted for the use of a part of the
officers and the pupils, who number about a hundred, and occupy eight
cabins, each with two portholes; here the young men eat, and drink, and
sleep, as well as pursue their studies.</p>

<p>The officers of the <i>Jean Bart</i> consist of a full captain in
command, a second captain, a chaplain, ten lieutenants, one having
charge of each pupil’s cabin, or <i>poste</i>, as it is called, and two
giving instruction in sailing and gunnery; a surgeon-major, who gives
instructions respecting the means of keeping a crew in health; two
assistant-surgeons, an engineer, a drawing-master, and some others.</p>

<p>The Minister, as in the case of the summer cruise of junior pupils,
settles the course to be taken by the <i>Jean Bart</i>. Generally
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page676" id = "page676">676</a></span>
the West India islands are visited in the months of March and April,
when the pupils are principally exercised in hydrographical works off
St. Pierre and Fort de France; in gunnery on board, and small-arms on
shore; in the daily management of boats for embarkation and
disembarkation; and in the management of sails in the intricate channels
of the archipelago. They are shown, moreover, how to perform difficult
operations, such as the unshipping of the rudder and bringing it on deck
for examination, lifting a mast, &amp;c. The pupils are required to keep
written records of all such operations, and to illustrate the narrative
when necessary with drawings. When they visit foreign yards and
arsenals, they are expected to give minute accounts of what they have
seen there, and besides a daily journal, to write critical notices of
all the different machines, methods of rigging, and maneuvers, which
they have witnessed.</p>

<p>The difficult channel of the Isle St. Sebastian, off the coast of
Brazil, that of the Bermudas, the river Hudson, and the coast of
Newfoundland, are among the places selected to initiate the pupils in
the difficulties of navigation. At Annapolis, in the Chesapeake, a visit
is paid to the National Naval School of the United States at the season
when the general examinations take place in that establishment. The
voyage usually terminates with a visit to Cape Breton and some points of
Newfoundland; the fisheries and drying-houses of St. Pierre and Miquelon
are generally visited, and the <i>Jean Bart</i> returns to Brest between
the 1st and 5th of August, having been absent ten months. A&nbsp;sailing
brig named the <i>Obligado</i> has lately been attached to the <i>Jean
Bart</i> as a supplementary vessel.</p>


<p class = "smallhead"><a name = "france_arch" id = "france_arch" href =
"#navy_france">SCHOOL OF NAVAL ARCHITECTURE AT PARIS.</a></p>

<p>The construction of ships and engines in the French naval service is
intrusted to the Corps of Marine Engineering, (<i>Corps du Génie
Maritime</i>,) consisting of 121 officers, viz., 1 inspector-general, 10
directors of naval construction, 40 marine engineers, and 70 assistant
engineers.</p>

<p>This corps is recruited from the graduates of the Polytechnic, and
having passed satisfactorily the required examination for the public
service, are sent to the School of Application of Naval Engineering at
Paris, and to the dockyards, to learn their special business. The usual
number in attendance is 30, and the annual cost of the school is about
100,000 francs.</p>

<p>The course occupies two years and a-half&mdash;three winters in Paris
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page677" id = "page677">677</a></span>
and two summers in the dockyards. The pupils having a good general
education and a complete special knowledge of mathematics and
geometrical drawing, the courses are from the start eminently
practical.</p>

<p>The instruction in Paris during the first session consists of: 1, a
course on construction; 2, on displacement and stability; 3, on strength
of materials; 4, English; 5, free-hand drawing; 6, plan-drawing of
vessels. During the second session it consists of: 1, a practical course
on steam-engines; 2, a theoretical course on steam; 3, applied
mechanics, machines in general; 4, English; 5, accounts; 6,
plan-drawing, ships and engines; 7, pictorial drawing. During the third
session: 1, course on stability, (2d&nbsp;part;) 2, on naval
architecture; 3, naval artillery; 4, technology of workshops, special to
the navy; 5, accounts; 6, English; 7, plan-drawing, projects for ships;
8, free-hand drawing.</p>

<p>In the first year ship-building is taken up; in the second, the
steam-engine, and in the third the two are combined and completed. When
in the dockyards, the pupils are placed under the order of the engineer
in charge of works in execution, who sees that they are attentive to
their duty, and have proper instruction. He also examines and certifies
the journals which the pupils have to keep. The director of the school
gives each pupil detailed instruction to guide him in the choice of the
practical work he shall attend to. The first summer is devoted to the
construction of ships, the second to that of engines. The pupils select
the ports to which they will go, according to their standing in their
class.</p>

<p>At the end of two years and a half, the pupils are examined by a
board, and if found qualified, they are appointed assistant engineers of
the third class. If they fail to pass, they may be allowed another
year&mdash;but failing in that, they are definitely rejected.</p>

<p>The private pupils, natives or foreigners, who to the number of eight
are allowed to attend the course in Paris, may obtain permission to go
through the whole practical course in one of the imperial dockyards, but
are not subjected to the same discipline as the regular pupils. On
leaving, they receive from the director a certificate of the course gone
through, their talent and diligence.</p>

<p>The school is under the immediate orders of a Director of Naval
Construction, who is also one of the professors, and is assisted in the
several branches taught by other professors, who are marine engineers,
and a special teacher of drawing, and another of the English
language.</p>

<p>The progress of the French Navy is represented in the following
statistics taken from the Statesman’s Year Book for 1871: In 1780 the
war fleet consisted of 60 first-class ships, 24 second class, and 182
smaller vessels,&mdash;total 266 ships, with 13,300 guns, and 78,000
sailors. In 1805, the number was reduced by casualties and neglect to 18
men-of-war, with 1,352 guns. In 1844 the whole force amounted to 226
sailing vessels, and 47 steamers, with 8,639 guns and 24,513 sailors. In
1855 the navy was reorganized, by the introduction of every new
appliance of naval architecture, construction, and ordnance, with the
following results, in 1869-70:</p>

<p>The iron-clads <i>Magenta, Solferino, Couronne, Normandie,
Invincible</i>, and the cupola ship <i>Taureau</i>, are plated, with
rifle breech-loading guns, and are not surpassed in strength and
destructive armament by the ships of any other navy.</p>

<p>Eleven of the smaller iron-clads, besides the ordinary floating
batteries, are so constructed that when out of service they can be taken
to pieces, packed up and stored away at the arsenal of Toulon.</p>

<p>The navy is manned by a marine conscription, which dates back to
1683. For this purpose the maritime population is divided into five
grand divisions, the centres of which are the five great Naval stations,
with 12 subdivisions, including all the great seaports. Within these
divisions all men and youths from the 18th to 50th year of age, devoted
to a sea-going life, are enrolled, to the number of about 170,000.
Except in a national emergency the government dispenses with the
services of all under 20, and over 40, as well as pilots, captains,
fathers of large families, and seamen ready for long voyages in merchant
ships.</p>

<p>The navy was officered in 1869 by two admirals, 16 vice admirals
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page680" id = "page680">680</a></span>
in active service, and 10 on the reserve list; 30 rear admirals in
active, and 19 on reserve list; 130 captains of first class; 286
captains of frigates; 825 lieutenants; 600 ensigns; and 300 midshipmen,
or aspirants;&mdash;total, 2,218 officers, and 39,346 sailors, who,
together with engineers, dockyard laborers, surgeons, chaplains, brought
up the number in actual service in 1869 to 74,403, which did not include
28,623 marines.</p>

<p>The commercial marine of France embraced in 1867, 15,259 vessels,
with a tonnage of 1,042,811, ranging from 30 tons to 800 tons each, and
employing over 150,000 seamen, including 40,000 officers, whose duties
required special professional training. Of these, 607 were steamers,
with an aggregate of 129,777 tons and 55,160 horse power. The value of
the commerce of France for 1867-8 was 7,500 millions of francs.</p>


<p class = "smallhead">II. NAVAL AND NAVIGATION SCHOOLS.</p>

<p>The French government was among the earliest to provide special
schools for the officers of its merchant service as well as for its
war-vessels. Prior even to the establishment, under an ordinance issued
by Cardinal Richelieu, of schools for the study of navigation in 1629,
Henry III., in 1584, had instituted examinations for boatswains and
captains of merchant vessels, for which preparation had to be made with
private teachers. In 1791 free schools of hydrography were authorized in
thirty-four sea-ports; out of 24,000 pupils of these schools, from 1850
to 1866, 3,731 qualified themselves as captains of vessels in the
foreign trade, and 5,118 for service in the coasting trade. Prior to
1800, in fitness of design and skill in construction, French naval
architecture was superior to that of other countries.</p>

<p>The system of education for the mercantile and military marine
embraced in 1866 the following schools:</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>&nbsp; 1. Nautical School for the Orphans of Sailors.</p>
<p>&nbsp; 2. The Inflexible and other School-ships.</p>
<p>&nbsp; 3. Naval Apprentice Schools at the government naval
stations.</p>
<p>&nbsp; 4. School for Boatswains and Shipmasters.</p>
<p>&nbsp; 5. School for Naval Engineers and Stokers.</p>
<p>&nbsp; 6. Naval Drawing School.</p>
<p>&nbsp; 7. Schools of Navigation and Hydrography.</p>

<p class = "smallhead">INTRODUCTION.</p>

<p><span class = "firstword">The</span> organization of the North German
Confederation, and more recently of the German Empire, and the
necessities of its position, have already led to the rapid development
of a military marine, and the unity of the commercial interests of the
different States will soon expand its navigation as well as its naval
armament.</p>


<h5><a name = "navy_germany_prussia" id = "navy_germany_prussia" href =
"#navy_germany">1. KINGDOM OF PRUSSIA.</a></h5>

<p>Long before Prussia was largely interested in either a military or
commercial marine, the government had provided for the systematic
training of all concerned in the construction, equipment, and running of
ships, whether destined for the defense of the country or to its
commercial interests. After enjoying opportunities of studying the
theory of their business, as well as the practical application of its
principles, they must pass an examination to test their knowledge both
of the theory and practice&mdash;with a provision that no one shall
assume the responsibility of the life and property of others without
holding a certificate of proficiency.</p>


<p class = "smallhead">NAVIGATION SCHOOLS.</p>

<p>There are six schools, situated at Memul, Dantzic, Pollan, Grabow
(near Stettin), and Stralsund, devoted to the education of young men who
propose to become mariners and masters of merchant vessels.
A&nbsp;single director, residing at Dantzic, has the superintendence of
all these schools, which have each two professors, each in charge of a
division of the school, and an assistant who devotes himself to drawing
in connection with the construction of vessels, and of charts. The
principal has charge of the higher division, in which navigation and
geography, both of the sea, and of the natural productions and
commercial facilities of different countries are taught. The lower
division deals with subjects which concern pilots&mdash;their
professional and legal duties.</p>

<p>Candidates must have mastered the subjects of elementary instruction,
and are examined as to their ability to read, write, and compose in
their native language, and to go through ordinary arithmetical problems
with facility and accuracy. An examination of
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page682" id = "page682">682</a></span>
candidates takes place every year at each school, which is conducted by
the head professor, in the presence of the director of this class of
schools.</p>

<p>To be admitted to the examination the candidate must bring a
certificate of good character, that he is over 14 and under 40 years of
age. The school fee is ten thalers per quarter for the highest or
navigation class, and six thalers for the lower or pilot’s class. There
are 32 lessons per week in both divisions.</p>

<p>The subjects taught in the lowest division are:&mdash;arithmetic,
plane geometry, carpentry, plane and spherical trigonometry, navigation,
territorial and astronomical observations, drawing of sea charts and
astronomical maps, and the English language.</p>

<p>In the highest division, in addition to the studies of the lower, in
which the pupils are carried further on, rigging and other points of
practical seamanship, drawing the different parts of a vessel, the
commercial requirements respecting a ship’s papers, and the course of
exchange at the principal commercial ports, are taught.</p>

<p>A final examination is held in which diplomas are awarded to those
who have completed the whole course, and of proficiency in certain
studies, either of which are of practical service in obtaining
situations, and without which certain positions can not be obtained.</p>


<p class = "smallhead">NAVAL ARCHITECTURE.</p>

<p>In the Trade or Polytechnic School in Berlin, provision is made for
instruction in naval construction:</p>

<p><i>First</i>&mdash;In the mathematical foundation of the most
important physical laws; in physics, drawing, modeling, and the general
principles of construction; in practical hydraulics; the theory of
machinery, and the steam-engine.</p>

<p><i>Second</i>&mdash;In the application of these principles to the
business of ship-designing and construction, and particularly to designs
for vessels, and the different parts of a ship in detail; to the art of
ship-building; the general displacement of water and stability;
hydrostatic calculations; general principles with regard to the form of
vessels, and the theory of sailing and steam-ships; details of
construction of wooden and iron vessels; practice; and planning and
calculating the cost and capacity of vessels.</p>

<p>There are reviews of the ground gone over at the close of each term,
which is obligatory only on those who enjoy free places, and each
student receives a certificate at the end of his course, setting forth
all his lectures and practical exercises, with an opinion as to his
practical judgment.</p>

<p>Under the new army organization of 1869, the military forces of the
whole empire are divided into the Standing Army, under the control of
the Imperial Minister of War; the Landwehr, whose duties are limited to
the respective divisions from which it is drawn, under the control of
the Austrian and Hungarian war ministers; and the Landstrum, or general
levy, which is compulsory in the Tyrol and Military Frontier, and
voluntary in the rest of the empire. The Emperor is supreme chief of the
military and naval forces, and from him must emanate all concentrating
movements of troops. In 1871 the Standing Army consisted of 278,470 men
on the peace footing, and 838,700 on the war footing.</p>

<p>The naval forces of Austria consisted in 1871, of 46 steamers and 10

<p>The navy is officered and manned by 2 vice-admirals, 4 rear-admirals,
24 captains of steamers and frigates, 14 captains of corvettes, 106
lieutenants, 343 ensigns and cadets, and 3,803 sailors, besides 875
officers and men in the marine corps. On the war footing the sailors
number 3,743, and the marines 1,410. The men are recruited by
conscription from the seafaring population, although the voluntary
enlistments in the province of Dalmatia renders its enforcement
unnecessary.</p>

<p>The total commerce of Austria, comprising imports and exports,
exceeded $400,000,000. The commercial marine includes 7,830 vessels, of
324,415 tonnage, and 27,979 seamen. The Austrian Lloyd, a trading
society established in Trieste in 1833, owns a fleet of 70 steamers, of
12,500 horse-power.</p>

<p>To provide officials, well instructed and trained in the
administration of each department of the public service, military and
civil&mdash;war by land and sea&mdash;both for military and commercial
purposes, the government establishes schools, with studies and practical
exercises adapted to each branch.</p>

<p class = "smallhead">SCHOOLS FOR THE MILITARY AND COMMERCIAL
MARINE.</p>

<p class = "heading">1. <i>Military Marine.</i></p>

<p>There are in Austria several kinds of naval schools, as follows: One
each for sailor boys, for marines, for quartermasters, for naval pupils
of the first class, for naval pupils of the second class, a theoretical
school for naval cadets, and a superior establishment for naval
officers.</p>

<p>1. The school for sailor boys is intended to train, as petty officers
for the navy, young men from the Slave and German provinces, admitted
between 12 and 14 years of age into the naval service. The instruction
lasts until the pupil has attained the age for the conscription; he is
then entered as a sailor and becomes a petty officer as soon as he gets
sufficiently used to the sea. The highest post he can attain is that of
upper boatswain (<i>Hochbootsmann</i>.)</p>

<p>2. The schools for marines (<i>Zeugscorps</i>) receive men drawn from
different corps of the army. They are trained as petty officers, and a
part receive the uniform. Those who are fit to become officers receive
their promotion when they leave their corps to enter the school.</p>

<p>3. The school for naval cadets of the first class is kept on board a
war vessel selected for the purpose. The object is to prepare for the
naval service youths of 16 or 18 years of age, who, on entering the
school have already received a complete civil technical education. The
teaching here consists, therefore, chiefly of practical seamanship, and
also of the application of previously acquired scientific knowledge to
navigation and nautical astronomy. The course occupies a year; on
leaving, the pupil is received as a naval cadet. After passing two or
three years at sea these cadets enter the theoretical school for naval
cadets.</p>

<p>4. The school for naval cadets of the second class is intended solely
to prepare them to become officers. In this school, beside the pupils
placed there at the cost of the State, there are others maintained by
endowments, and also others who pay for their instruction. The sons of
officers and State functionaries are entitled to enter this school at
the public expense, and any Austrian subject who has the necessary
qualifications is admitted on payment. Foreigners are also admissible as
paying pupils, provided they can obtain authorization from their own
government to enter the Austrian service. To be admitted, candidates
must be between 12 and 14 years of age, of sound health without bodily
defect, and able to pass a previous examination. The instruction is
given in accordance with a determined plan, on board a vessel prepared
expressly to receive the pupils. After three years’ instruction the
pupils leave the school as naval cadets and are sent to sea. At the end
of two or three years’ active service the cadets are admitted to the
theoretical school. This school receives from 40 to 50 pupils. The
chaplain on board is charged with the religious instruction; the other
teaching is given by professors from the hydrographic schools. The naval
officers of the school-ship give the instruction in practical
seamanship.</p>

<p>5. The theoretical school for naval cadets is on shore, and its
course occupies a year, after which the pupil undergoes the examination
prescribed for his commission as an officer. On leaving this theoretical
school the pupils are still naval cadets, but become officers when
appointed to a ship.</p>

<p>6. The superior school for naval officers is intended for the further
improvement in mathematical and hydrographic studies, of such young men
as have shown decided talent and taste for those sciences.</p>

protection of German navigation.</p>

<p>The war-fleet of the Empire, which embraces all that had been

<p>The system of professional training for officers of the Imperial Navy
is not yet matured. The Naval School at Kiel is still recognized.
Aspirants enter as naval cadets after passing an examination equivalent
to the requirements of a gymnasial maturity certificate, which in
general education is superior to the requirements of graduation of
either our Naval or Military Academy. Before entering on their
professional studies, the cadet is first sent on a cruise to test his
aptitude for sea-service. He then studies eight months at school and one
year at sea, to pass as midshipman; and one year more at school, and
three years at sea, to become sub-lieutenant.</p>

<p class = "smallhead">MARINE ACADEMY AT KIEL.</p>

<p>The German Marine Academy established in 1872, at Kiel, is designed
not for the education of cadets, but for the professional training and
improvement of officers already in the naval service of the
empire&mdash;and is of the same character as the Staff School of Berlin
for officers of the army. Those only will be received as pupils, whose
conduct and talents seem to qualify them for superior scientific
attainments, and, hereafter, for the filling of the most important
posts. These officer-pupils will be required to give proofs of their
diligence and progress by the production, from time to time, of theses
and dissertations on scientific subjects given to them by the
professors. At the same time, all naval officers will be permitted to
attend the courses of instruction when their professional duties do not
call them away.</p>

<p>The course of study is to occupy two terms, each of twelve months’
duration, with a vacation of three months for practical exercises.</p>

<p>The subjects for the first term are:&mdash;Mathematics, natural
philosophy, chemistry, the theory of naval war in all its branches,
military tactics in as far as disembarkations are concerned, coast
surveying, the theory of the formation of coasts, coastal defenses,
field fortification, the constitution of military courts, the principles
of international, military, and naval law, the system of administration,
sanitary science, especially with reference to life aboard ship and in
different climates, the elements of logic, ethics, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The following subjects will be included in the second
term:&mdash;Nautical astronomy, geodesy, theory of maps and charts, the
history of war, with especial reference to naval war, artillery,
ship-building, the construction of steam-engines (with practical
exercises), the position and construction of naval ports, physical
geography, the elements of geology, marine botany and zoölogy, and the
general history of modern literature and civilization, &amp;c.</p>
