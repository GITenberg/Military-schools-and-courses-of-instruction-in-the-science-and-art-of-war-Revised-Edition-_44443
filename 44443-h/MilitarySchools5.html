<p><span class = "firstword">The</span> Constitution of the United
States grants to Congress the power “to raise and support armies,” “to
provide and maintain a navy,” “to make rules for the government of the
land and naval forces; and to provide for calling forth the militia,” as
well as “for organizing, arming and disciplining” the same, and for
governing such parts of them as may be employed in the service of the
United States&mdash;reserving to the States, respectively, the
appointment of the officers, and the authority of training the militia
according to the discipline prescribed by Congress. By the same
instrument the President is made commander-in-chief of the army and navy
of the United States, and of the militia of the several States when
called into actual service of the United States “to execute the laws of
the Union, suppress insurrections, and repel invasions.”</p>

<p>By law of August, 1789, a department of war, and in 1798, a secretary
of the navy is provided to aid the President in the administration of
military and naval affairs; and the original rules and articles of war
enacted by the Congress of 1776, were continued in force, and in 1806
made the basis of the military code which has since governed all troops
mustered into the service of the United States.</p>

<p>In 1790 the rank and file of the regular army was fixed at 1,216 men.
In 1796 this force was organized into one corps of artillerists and
engineers, whose head-quarters was at West Point, two companies of light
dragoons, and four regiments of infantry of eight companies each. This
force was increased by additional regiments in the war of 1812, the
Indian war in Florida, and the war with Mexico, till in 1861, the army
consisted of 14,000 men, stationed in the different forts and garrisons,
and mainly on the Indian frontier. In the war of the Rebellion the
regular army was increased to 50,000 men.</p>

<p>By act of July 15,1870, the number of enlisted men was reduced
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page716" id = "page716">716</a></span>
to 30,000 by or before July 1, 1871. On the 20th of October, 1871, the
army was composed as follows:</p>

<p>When the insurrectionary movements and combinations of the Southern
States in 1861, proved too powerful to be suppressed by ordinary civil
powers, the President, April 15, called for 75,000 volunteers for three
months, to defend the capital, and May 3, 42,000 to serve for three
years or during the war. On the 22d of July he was authorized to accept
the services of 500,000, which, within six months afterwards was
increased to 1,000,000. This force proving inadequate, a levy of 300,000
men was ordered in 1863, and in 1864, another call for 500,000
men&mdash;making an aggregate of 2,653,062 mustered into the service of
the United States, or nearly one fourth of the entire male population of
the Northern States. This entire force was disbanded within one year
from the close of the war.</p>

<p>The development of the naval resources of the country was quite as
marvelous. In 1861 the entire navy consisted of 94 war vessels of all
classes and in all conditions, capable when in service of carrying 2,415
guns. Only 43 of these ships were in commission, and the seamen and
mariners numbered 7,000. In less than three years 200 war vessels were
constructed and 418 merchant vessels were converted to military service,
and over 50,000 men enlisted in the naval service.</p>

<p>The Southern States in rebellion put into the field over 500,000 men,
and exhausted their pecuniary resources, with the loss of 300,000
soldiers on the field or in hospital.</p>

<p>The debt of the United States contracted in the prosecution of the
war, stood in 1866 at the enormous sum of $2,783,425,879.</p>

<p>These extraordinary efforts were made under circumstances which are
not likely to exist again, and such expenditures could not be repeated
without national bankruptcy.</p>

<p>The Militia of the United States, by act of Congress of 1792,
consists of all white male citizens between the ages of 18 and 45, who
must be enrolled and arranged into brigades, regiments, and companies,
as the legislature of each State may direct. Of the militia, as
organized by state legislation, the governor is commander-in-chief,
except when called into the service of the United States. To provide
arms and equipments for the whole body of militia, arsenals and armories
are provided by Congress, in different parts of the country, at an
annual charge of $200,000 (since 1808).</p>

condition of the Militia of the several States,<a class = "tag" name =

<p>The above statement of the legal condition of the militia of the
several States, which together constitute the army of Reserve of the
United States, is not very creditable to all concerned&mdash;to the
cities and local communities, whose exemption from riots and illegal
combinations of bad men may depend on the fact of an organized force,
which the voice of authority could in an hour summon to the protection
of the threatened houses and workshops of the citizens;&mdash;to the
States, whose quota to any national call can not now be depended upon
except at the cost of extravagant bounties, and whose raw recruits thus
furnished would be worthless till after months of drill and field
manœuvres;&mdash;to the nation, whose strength should be its weakness
for purposes of foreign aggression, and its ability to summon millions
of willing men, familiar with military organization and duties, to the
defense of their hearths and free institutions.</p>

<p>The Volunteer Soldiery in time of peace, does not hold the same
distinct recognition in the armed forces of the United States, apart
from the Militia of the several States, as in Great Britain; and yet the
most efficient military organizations of the several States, and
especially in our larger cities, are of this character; and in most of
the States where uniform companies exist, they constitute a permanent
and important force, whose services have proved highly valuable in
quelling riots and protecting public property. Of the number of
regiments or companies&mdash;their officers and men, distinct from the
enrolled and organized State Militia, we have no official
statistics.</p>


<p class = "smallhead"><a name = "us_officers" id = "us_officers" href =
"#us">MODE OF OFFICERING THE ARMY.</a></p>

<p>The commissioned officers of the United States army are drawn from
three sources:&mdash;<i>First</i>, from the cadets of the Military
Academy at West Point; <i>Second</i>, from civil life; <i>Third</i>,
from the rank and file.</p>

<p>1. The appointment to the grade of lieutenant in either corps,
follows regularly to any cadet on graduation, after having completed the
course of instruction at West Point. From 1815 to 1832, the army was
officered almost exclusively from the Military Academy.</p>

<p>2. The expansion of the military force consequent on the Indian war
in Florida, from 1832 to 1837, and the Mexican war from 1845 to 1848,
and of the Civil war from 1861 to 1865, was followed by the <ins class =
"correction" title = "text has ‘apointment’">appointment</ins> of many
persons from civil life, who had received no military training, and
without any special qualifications beyond personal and political
considerations.</p>

<p>As a stimulus and reward to special service, promotions are
occasionally made from the rank and file, after a mere formal
examination in the elementary branches of a common school education, and
without the provision for professional training except such as can be
got from observation and private reading.</p>


<p class = "smallhead"><a name = "us_training" id = "us_training" href =
"#us">PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION AND TRAINING OF OFFICERS.</a></p>

<p>In the organization and movements of the armed forces of the
Colonies, the officers were trained in the military service of the
mother country.</p>

<p>In the War of Independence, the general spirit of the people supplied
for a time the want of trained soldiers and officers, beyond the small
force which had been schooled in the French and Indian Wars; but the
necessities of the service compelled Congress to authorize its
accredited agents abroad to offer commissions, especially to engineer
and artillery officers; and at the close of the war we find nearly all
the prominent officers in the artillery and engineer

departments had been trained abroad. Nearly all the fortifications were
planned by them and erected under their supervision. The names of
Steuben, Kosciusko, Du Portail, Radière, Romans, Vincent, Rochefontaine,
Toussard, Revardi, L’Enfant, Villefranche, and others of later date,
will suggest to any reader of the military history of the country, the
extent of our obligations to foreign military schools.</p>

<p>The sources of systematic professional instruction and training for
officers of the armed forces of the United States, are&mdash;</p>

<div class = "inlist">
<p>I. The National Military Academy at West Point, for the general
scientific instruction of officers of all arms.</p>

<p><span class = "firstword">The</span> influence of the United States
Military Academy upon education, as well as its wide reputation as a
school of science, render an inquiry into its rise and progress, a
subject both of interest and profit. Since it is mind, rather than any
system of forms and studies, which gives power to such institutions, a
mere statement of dates and facts is insufficient to give us a just view
of its character. We must, if possible, trace the spirit of the men who
guided, and the principles impressed upon it. To do this, we shall
resort, not merely to the record of events, but to our memory of men and
acts, with which we were for years familiar.</p>

<p>It was not to be expected, that schools of refined, scientific art
should be founded by small colonies in the wilderness of the new world.
When even their clergymen must resort to Europe for education, and their
lawyers for license, it was in vain to expect their soldiers to be
accomplished engineers. When the revolutionary war came on, this fact
became a painful experience. No man felt it more than Washington. With a
people, whose patriotism was unquenchable; with soldiers, who rivaled
the warriors of Leonidas, he found the best and truest of men, with the
smallest possible share of military science. He was obliged to depend on
European engineers for a skill which his countrymen did not possess;
while their European ideas, and artificial habits were displeasing to
his American principles.<a class = "tag" name = "tag10_2" id = "tag10_2"
href = "#note10_2">2</a> He felt military instruction to be a primary
want in the country. Accordingly, he was the real founder of the
Military Academy; that is, he put forth the <i>germinal idea</i>. What
the plan of it was to be, and what shape it should ultimately take, he
did not state, and probably had not thought of; for Washington in the
office of president, seldom meddled with the details of public affairs.
What he meant to obtain, however, he distinctly stated, in his message,
dated December 3rd, 1793; in referring to measures of national defense,
he says an inquiry may be made: “whether
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page722" id = "page722">722</a></span>
your own experience, in the several states has not detected some
imperfection in the scheme; and whether a material feature in the
improvement of it ought not to be to afford an opportunity for the
<i>study of those branches of the military art which can scarcely ever
be obtained by practice alone</i>.”</p>

<p>In his message of December 7th, 1796, he said: “Whatever, argument
may be drawn, from particular examples, superficially viewed, a thorough
examination of the subject will evince that the art of war is at once
comprehensive and complicated; that it demands much previous study, and
that the profession of it in its most improved and perfect state, is
always of great moment to the security of a nation. This, therefore,
ought to be a serious care of every government; <i>and for this purpose
an academy, where a regular course of instruction is given</i>, is an
obvious expedient, which different nations have employed.”<a class =
"tag" name = "tag10_3" id = "tag10_3" href = "#note10_3">3</a></p>

<p>The views, always entertained, and repeatedly expressed by General
Washington, were adopted by Mr. Adams, and Mr. McHenry, secretary of
war, in his administration, made an elaborate report on this subject,
which was transmitted to congress, on 10th of December, 1800. It is due
to Mr. McHenry, to say that his ideas of what ought to be a course of
military instruction, were far in advance of what were actually
provided, till after the war of <ins class = "correction" title =
"printed with long dash">1812&ndash;’15</ins> proved his ideas to be
correct. In 1794, prior to the last message of Washington, congress
attempted to supply the want of a military academy, by attaching cadets
to the corps of artillerists, and engineers. This corps consisted of
four battalions, to each of which eight cadets were to be attached. This
made the whole number of cadets thirty-two; and for this corps of
artillerists, engineers and cadets, the secretary of war was directed to
procure books, instruments and apparatus. The term <i>cadet</i>
signifying in French, the youngest brother of a family, and in Spanish,
a young volunteer officer, became naturally applied to young men, who
were junior, volunteer officers. In England, the <i>cadet</i> of a
family was a young son, who volunteered for the India service; and in
the United States has been properly applied to the youth, who enter the
military academy.</p>

<p>It seems from the message of Washington, in 1796, that the attempt at
military instruction, was a failure. No place, no teachers, no studies,
were appointed. It was on the 16th of March, 1802, in
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page723" id = "page723">723</a></span>
the early administration of Mr. Jefferson, that congress established, by
that name, the <i>Military Academy</i>. It was still made part of an
army corps; the idea of making a separate institution for scientific
studies not being yet matured. The artillerists and engineers were made
two distinct corps, of which there were forty cadets of artillery and
ten of engineers. The corps of engineers consisted of a major, two
captains, four lieutenants, and ten cadets, making seventeen in all.
<i>The corps constituted the military academy</i>, established at West
Point, in the State of New York. So little idea was then entertained of
the true objects and mode of scientific instruction, that the law
required the cadet, as well as officer, to do duty in any part of the
United States. In other words, the only idea of the military academy, at
that time, was <i>a place appointed where the officers of engineers
might give or receive instruction, when not on other duty</i>. The
actual academy, such as it was, conformed to that idea. The major of
engineers was the commander, or superintendent. The two captains were
instructors, and the cadets were pupils. It was, as a school, an
inchoate existence, without regular teachers, or limited studies, or
proper discipline. Yet, even in this imperfect condition, it did, as we
shall see, some service which ought to be gratefully remembered.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, let us turn for a moment, to the <i>place</i> which
is so memorable in the annals of this country, and is now so intimately
associated with science. If Dr. Beattie is correct in saying that the
character of the mind is much associated with natural scenery, no place
in America could have been more wisely selected, as the site of a
national institution. World renowned, as West Point justly is, there is
that in its scenery and associations, more interesting to a poetic or a
patriotic mind, than its famed Academy. Its green plain, hidden amidst
its mountains; its craggy summits; its rocky barriers; its dark
evergreens; its darker waters, flowing on forever; that beautiful view
of town and country, seen through the frowning brows of Crow Nest and
the Beacon; that quiet vale, where Washington oft bent his steps; those
lonely little mounds, where the soldiers of the Revolution repose; these
forts and ramparts now indistinctly seen, which once guarded these
mountain passes; yon ledge of rocks, where Kosciusko once made his
little garden; all these and other memorable things, call up whatever is
sublime in nature, or noble in history. It is impossible to forget them.
It is impossible for the dullest mind, not to have its sensibilities
excited, or its character elevated by the contemplation of such sublime
scenes, or such interesting events. When such a spot
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page724" id = "page724">724</a></span>
becomes the place of our education, its memories become poetic; its
associations mingle with the flow of life, and the structure of our
minds.</p>

<p>To return. The law having authorized this ideal Academy, it was
immediately instituted, by the appointment of officers. The Academy, it
is seen, was on quite a small scale. In fact, so far as teaching was
concerned, the Academy consisted of two captains of engineers and ten
cadets. The two captains were <span class = "smallcaps">William H.
Barron</span> and <span class = "smallcaps">Jared Mansfield</span>. Mr.
Mansfield had been a teacher of mathematics, navigation, and the
classics, first at New Haven, (Conn.,) and then at Philadelphia. He had
written a volume of “Essays” on mathematics and physics, quite original,
and distinguishing him at that time, as the first mathematician of his
country. This was brought to the notice of Mr. Jefferson, who with no
great love of military affairs, was a warm friend of science. When the
act was passed authorizing the Military Academy, Mr. Jefferson wrote to
Mr. Mansfield, that he would appoint him a captain of engineers, for the
<i>very purpose of becoming a teacher at West Point</i>. Accordingly he
was appointed, on May 3rd, 1802; Captain Barron had been appointed in
April. Then, in May 1802, the actual Military Academy was constituted,
Captains Barron and Mansfield being teachers of mathematics and
philosophy, to some half dozen or more cadets and lieutenants. No
professor of engineering or of any other department was appointed before
1812. In pursuing the course and growth of instruction at West Point,
during this period of ten years, we can only refer to the services of
the instructors and graduates. In fact, there were no graduates prior to
1815; but there were <i>appointments</i> made from the cadets of the
Military Academy, after more or less study at West Point. To understand
what was done, we must refer to the actions of teachers and cadets,
rather than to history. Its teachers were few and its annals brief.
Captain Mansfield, after a year’s teaching at West Point, was in 1808,
appointed by Mr. Jefferson, to a more responsible position. It was
necessary to the correctness of our public surveys, that the meridian
lines and the base lines (which are co-ordinates,) should be established
with astronomical accuracy. For this purpose, Captain Mansfield was
appointed surveyor general of the north-western territory; furnished
with astronomical instruments, and taking his residence in Ohio,
proceeded to establish and perfect that beautiful system of surveys, by
which the north-western states are distinguished. Retaining his military
bent, with a view to his original destination at West Point, he actually
returned there in 1814, to
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page725" id = "page725">725</a></span>
recommence, as we shall see hereafter, his career as an instructor in
the national institution. Of Captain Barron, his co-teacher, we only
know that he was relieved in February, 1807. At the same time, his
successor, <span class = "smallcaps">Ferdinand R. Hassler</span>, was
appointed, and remained till he resigned in 1810. Mr. Hassler was, we
believe, a Swiss by birth. He wrote a small treatise on mathematics, and
had quite an extensive reputation, as a mathematician, but was said to
be too analytical and refined in the character of his mind, for American
practical habits. He was intended for the coast survey, and, we believe,
actually commenced it.</p>

<p>In November, 1806, <span class = "smallcaps">Alden Partridge</span>,
superintendent of engineers, was appointed <i>acting assistant</i>
professor of mathematics, and retained that position till April,
1812.</p>

<p>The “Teacherships” of French and drawing were created, by the act of
February, 1803, being a very important addition to the original scheme
of the Academy. To the teachership of French, <span class =
"smallcaps">Francis De Masson</span> was appointed, March, 1804, and
resigned in March, 1812. To the teachership of drawing, <span class =
"smallcaps">Christian E. Zoeller</span> was appointed, September, 1808,
and resigned in April, 1810. Mr. Masson was a Frenchman by birth; Mr.
Zoeller, a Swiss. Mr. Masson was highly spoken of by Colonel Williams, a
good judge of what constitutes a scholar. Mr. Zoeller was an amiable
man, of no high attainments, whose instruction in drawing was wholly
confined to the military part, fortifications and bridges.</p>

<p>From this brief history, it appears, that there were but six teachers
at West Point, between 1802 and 1812. Of these, no more than four were
ever present at one time, and that only between 1808 and 1810. The
teachers present, each year, were as follows:</p>

<p>This glance at the actual teachers of West Point enables us to
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page726" id = "page726">726</a></span>
see at a glance, what was done. No continuous study was pursued at all,
except mathematics. For the eight years, between 1804 and 1812, French
was taught by an able professor, Mr. Masson, and from 1808 to 1810,
drawing. In 1812, this inchoate existence of the Academy was ended by
the act of congress, reorganizing the institution, and placing it on a
permanent and extensive foundation. The next period of five years, from
1812 to 1817, was the <i>forming</i> period of the Academy. In some
respects, its elements were chaotic. In others, its <i>personnel</i> was
inefficient and inharmonious. In others, again, its materials of
instruction were inadequate. From this condition it finally emerged, and
attained its present high character and usefulness. The history of this
change is important, if not interesting to those who would understand
what are the true foundations of a great school of education. In the
meanwhile, let us return to what the <span class =
"smallcaps">Cadets</span> of the Academy had done. If they were few, and
with small means of instruction, they may nevertheless have shown that
the Academy was not altogether fruitless. How many cadets were appointed
between 1802 and 1812, we do not exactly know, but we have the number
appointed <i>from the Academy</i>. The number of cadets promoted from
the Academy during that period were for each year, thus:</p>

<p>This makes eighty-nine in ten years. Let us look at their career, as
stated in the brief annals of the army; or, as they are retained in
memory. Of this number, comprising ten cadets of more than half a
century ago, this is the result:</p>

<p>This is no bad roll. If we were to search our college rolls for those
who had been really useful, those who died in battle, or served to the
end, or entered other fields of usefulness, or now live in the
performance of duty, we should find a less grateful exhibition than
this. The number of those who had been “dropped,” or “dismissed,” for
incompetence, or vice, would be far greater. Alas! if we could read the
secret history of the college roll, how sad would be that account! We
know, that in times past, many of the officers of the army were addicted
to dissipation. Happily, we can say, many less now. But since we would
estimate the value of the Military Academy, even in its most imperfect
condition, let us see <i>who</i> some of these men were.</p>

<p>The first cadet appointed was General <span class =
"smallcaps">Joseph G. Swift</span>,<a class = "tag" name = "tag10_4" id
= "tag10_4" href = "#note10_4">4</a> who having risen to the rank of
general of engineers and inspector of the Military Academy, resigned,
became surveyor of the port of New York, and is now a venerable and
respected citizen of Geneva. Of those who were killed in battle,
<i>Eleazer D. Wood</i>, (whose monument stands at West Point,) was
killed while loading a cannon, in the sortie from Fort Erie. Five others
were killed on the Canada frontier, and four in battle with the Indians.
Of those who died in service, <i>two</i> reached the rank of general,
and <i>eight</i> that of field officers. Of those who are now in
service, (7,) one is General <span class = "smallcaps">Joseph G.
Totten</span>, chief of the corps of engineers, who served on the Canada
frontier in the war of 1812, and at the siege of Vera Cruz. One is Col.
<span class = "smallcaps">Sylvanus Thayer</span>, who served in the war
of 1812-’15; who was superintendent of the Military Academy from 1817 to
1833, and to whom it is indebted for a large part of its usefulness. Of
these gentlemen, we shall have more to say, when we refer to the forming
period of the institution. Another is Colonel <span class =
"smallcaps">Rene De Russy</span>, who was distinguished in the battle of
Plattsburg, and became superintendent of the Academy on the retirement
of Col. Thayer. Of those who resigned or were disbanded, many died
young; one became a member of congress and politician; and another, Col.
<span class = "smallcaps">William McRee</span>, was a remarkable man,
distinguished for gallant conduct in the battle of Niagara and Fort
Erie, a member of the board of engineers, and of cultivated mind; he
resigned from the army and became surveyor general for Missouri and
Arkansas, and finally died of cholera at St. Louis. Of the whole
eighty-nine, who were commissioned prior to 1813, but twenty-one were
alive in 1850, and several others have died since. The few
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page728" id = "page728">728</a></span>
who now remain have seen more than half a century’s service in useful
employments. Perhaps it should be mentioned to the advantage of the
Military Academy, as a school of physical education, that at the end of
half a century, twenty of its pupils out of eighty-nine, should be yet
alive. In twenty years of civil life, as appears from the United States
census of 1830 and 1850, more than the same proportion of youth between
ten and twenty years of age perished. The general strength and health of
the pupils of West Point are beyond a doubt greater than that of the
same number of young men brought up in the ordinary methods of
education. This is not wholly due to physical exercises, but also to
moral education, and to the care and comforts of their mode of life.
Will any one deny that <i>discipline</i> is a part of moral education?
Is not self-restraint, the regularity of habits, and the art of using
the mind in intellectual pursuits, the most important elements of a
moral education? It is to all these, and not merely the training and
exercise of arms, that the eléves of the Academy owe so large a share of
the health and strength of life.</p>

<p>In the period of its history which we have now examined, the Military
Academy was really only in the germ of its existence. Like most other
useful or remarkable enterprises, it was first thought of as a thing
needed; then began without any clear idea of what it would become, and
was then improved upon, till it grew to be of magnitude and
importance.</p>


<h4><a name = "westpoint_history_II" id = "westpoint_history_II" href =
"#westpoint">PERIOD II.&mdash;1812&ndash;1825.</a></h4>

<p>The Academy, in its germinal existence, whose history we have briefly
traced, was obviously inadequate to supply the army and country with
young men instructed in the art of war. Congress authorized the
appointment of a large number of cadets. But the President did not act
upon it, because there were neither professors, nor books, nor quarters,
nor material at West Point for their training. In 1808, Mr. Jefferson
recommended an enlargement of the Academy. In 1810, Mr. Madison did the
same. In vain, however, were these recommendations, till the nation was
roused from its indolent repose by the sudden shock of war. In 1811, the
battle of Tippecanoe electrified the people. The war-whoop sounded on
the north-western frontier, and the aggressive conduct of Great Britain
became insufferable. War was an imperious necessity. Then it was that
the use if not necessity of an institution for military training became
obvious to all reflecting minds. In April, 1812, the act was passed
which erected the frame-work of the present
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page729" id = "page729">729</a></span>
Military Academy. As this legal outline has been little changed since,
it is necessary that we should look to its provisions, for correct ideas
of what the law intended, and what has been substantially carried out in
its growth and development.</p>

<p>1st. It was provided, that the number of cadets might be increased to
two hundred and fifty, and attached at the discretion of the President
as students to the Military Academy at West Point, and be subject to the
regulations thereof.</p>

<p>2d. That these cadets should be between the ages of fourteen and
twenty-one, and previous to his appointment should be well versed in
reading, writing, and arithmetic.</p>

<p>3d. That the Military Academy should consist of the Corps of
Engineers, the Professors of Philosophy, of Mathematics, of Engineering,
with their assistants, and the teachers of French and Drawing.</p>

<p>4th. That when any cadet shall receive a regular degree from the
Academical Staff, he shall be considered a candidate for a commission in
any corps for which he shall be deemed competent.</p>

<p>In addition to these provisions for education, money was appropriated
for buildings and books, and for a band of music. The expenditure
provided for was very small, compared with the need of the Academy; but
it was enough for a beginning. It was far easier, as we shall see, to
provide for all its material wants, than to bring it into that state of
moral and intellectual discipline, which was essential to the attainment
of great results. The institution, in its former period, was in an
inchoate condition. A&nbsp;few young officers, raised up partly as
teachers, and partly as pupils, without a course of studies, without
regulations, and without discipline, could furnish no just ideas, from
experience, of what a highly intellectual, well-ordered school of
science should be; and accordingly the want of just ideas of education
was precisely what first stood in the way of making West Point what it
subsequently became.</p>

<p>For more than five years there was a wrestling between old and new
ideas. There was a positive ignorance of what high education should be.
In fact, the country had no models for it. Then there were old habits to
overcome. Lastly, there was a willfulness on the part of some in
authority, opposed as long as opposition was possible, to any new idea
of things. For people are aware, in this day of change and novelty, how
strongly the <i>vis inertiæ</i> of intellectual habits opposes
intellectual improvement. This very <i>vis inertiæ</i>, at first, almost
nullified the power of law itself to improve and enlarge the studies at
West Point. How it acted we shall see. The first
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page730" id = "page730">730</a></span>
difficulty at West Point was, (after preparing the accommodations and
material) in complying with the spirit of the law, and placing the
<i>academic instruction on the high ground really intended</i>. To
understand this we must here advert to some provisions of the law which
were either overlooked or neglected. First, the law expressly recognized
an <i>Academic Staff</i>, who should confer <i>degrees</i>. Secondly,
that the cadets of West Point should be <i>students</i>, subject to the
<i>regulations of the Academy</i>. All this evidently meant that these
two hundred and fifty young men should be placed, like students in
college, under regular academic instruction, and that the professors and
teachers should constitute an academic faculty, with power to regulate
the education of the cadets, and confer degrees according to merit.
Ultimately this was accomplished; but it took much effort on the part of
the Professors to bring the military authorities into a just conception
of this scheme. During the years 1812 and 1813, little was done except
in commencing buildings, buying apparatus, appointing the cadets, and
getting ready for the real business of the institution. Here we must
record the first academic faculty organized at West Point. The
professorship of Natural and Experimental Philosophy, which was higher
in rank and emoluments than the others, was instituted expressly for
Col. <span class = "smallcaps">Jared Mansfield</span>, who, having
retained his commission in the corps of engineers, while he was
surveyor-general in the north-western states, was now (October, 1812,)
appointed to the same professorship which he held ten years before.
<span class = "smallcaps">Andrew Ellicott</span>, who had been
astronomer of the United States, and had a wide reputation for
mathematical knowledge, was appointed professor of Mathematics, in
September, 1813, at which time, also, <span class = "smallcaps">Alden
Partridge</span> was appointed professor of Engineering. The teacher of
drawing was <span class = "smallcaps">Christian E. Zoeller</span>,
reappointed; and of French, <span class = "smallcaps">Florimond De
Masson</span>. This was the first academic faculty. Subsequently, the
principal professors were allowed assistants, and other teachers were at
still later periods provided in the departments of Ethics, Tactics,
Artillery, Chemistry, &amp;c., as the institution was enlarged, and its
wants were better known. The gentlemen above named were, however, the
first professors and the first faculty. They had the real <i>labor</i>
and responsibility of taking the initial steps, and to a large extent,
of forming the Military Academy. At the very first step a difficulty
occurred, which could not have been anticipated. Captain <span class =
"smallcaps">Alden Partridge</span>, (who was professor of Engineering)
was superintendent of West Point, from January, 1815, to November,
1816&mdash;nearly two years. He was a man of strong will; of
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page731" id = "page731">731</a></span>
independent and rather eccentric ideas, who quite naturally as a
military man, long resident at the Point, wished to forget that the law
required the education of the institution to be decided by an academic
faculty, and governed by regulations. He chose rather to remember that
it was a military post, governed by a military commandant, and sought to
gratify his own ambition by grasping its sole direction. Professors
Mansfield and Ellicott, who held no command in the army, took a
different view of the subject. They justly thought, that the object of
the institution was to give a thorough <i>scientific education</i>,
especially adapted to the art of war; that this required discipline, and
a course of studies systematic and complete; and that all this was
evidently contemplated by the law, which said that the Academy should be
governed by regulations, and hence an academic faculty. This difference
of opinion was vital. It led to a controversy of two years, which
belongs to the private rather than the public history of the Academy.
Little of it was known to the public, and we are now concerned only in
the issue. Had the views of Captain Partridge prevailed, the institution
never could have become what it is.<a class = "tag" name = "tag10_5" id
= "tag10_5" href = "#note10_5">5</a> Fortunately, the Professors had the
law on their side, and also the good opinion of the administration, and
eventually gave to the scientific college the cast and features which it
now has. For three years, between 1814 and 1817, this internal
controversy continued, gradually tending to give the Academy a
systematic organization. General <span class = "smallcaps">Joseph G.
Swift</span>, (head of the corps of engineers,) who was officially
inspector of the Academy, took up his residence at West Point, in
November, 1816, but remained only two months. While there, there could
be no controversy, as to the government of the Academy, since the
commander of engineers was legally its chief. After the removal of
General Swift, Captain Partridge, as senior officer, again took command.
It was determined, however, to remove him; and the Government most
fortunately hit upon an officer, whose character, education, and
accomplishments, most eminently fitted him for the post of governing,
and disciplining the young men, who were in turn to become the
<i>savans</i> as well as the ornaments of their country. This officer
was <span class = "smallcaps">Sylvanus Thayer</span>, a native of
Massachusetts, commissioner in 1808 from West Point to the engineer
corps, and who had recently traveled in Europe, examining the military
schools of France and Germany. The arrival of Colonel Thayer constitutes
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page732" id = "page732">732</a></span>
the most important epoch in the history of West Point. Why it is so will
appear evident when we trace out the <i>scientific culture</i> of the
Academy, and the discipline which it furnishes. Up to 1813, we have seen
that the Military Academy was merely a small company of officers and
cadets, who, being stationed at one post, were required while there to
pursue certain mathematical and military studies. It had no one element
of organization. From 1814 to 1817, professors Mansfield and Ellicott
were struggling with no more than partial success, to give it
organization and systematic instruction. But, in 1817, Colonel Thayer,
who had seen in France what such institutions required, and whose
enlightened mind realized the necessity of adopting better methods, at
once coöperated with the Professors, in making a permanent and
successful reform.</p>

<p>At this point we should notice the additions made to the academic
staff, between 1816 and 1819, and the steps taken by the war department
toward carrying out the views of the Professors, and Colonel Thayer.
<span class = "smallcaps">Claude Crozet</span> was appointed professor
of Engineering, in March, 1817; <span class = "smallcaps">David B.
Douglas</span> was appointed assistant professor of Natural Philosophy,
in January, 1815; <span class = "smallcaps">Charles Davies</span> was
appointed assistant professor of Mathematics in December, 1816. Rev.
<span class = "smallcaps">Thomas Picton</span> was appointed Chaplain,
and professor of Ethics, in July, 1818. <span class = "smallcaps">Thomas
Gimbrede</span> was appointed teacher of Drawing, in January, 1819.
Major <span class = "smallcaps">John Bliss</span>, instructor of
Tactics, in April, 1818; Lieut. <span class = "smallcaps">George W.
Gardiner</span>, instructor of Artillery, in September, 1817. <span
class = "smallcaps">Claudius Berard</span> succeeded Francis Masson, as
teacher of French, in January, 1815; <span class = "smallcaps">Joseph Du
Commun</span> was appointed second teacher of French, in March, 1818. Of
the old professors, Captain Partridge and Francis Masson were gone; all
the others remain. Thus, in 1817, when Colonel Thayer took charge of the
Academy, the corps of teachers was composed of professors Mansfield,
Ellicott, and Crozet; teachers Zoeller and Berard; and assistant
professors Douglas and Davies, exclusive of the military teachers and of
those appointed in 1818 and 1819. This was properly the Academic Staff,
and Colonel Thayer was willing and pleased to have them take their
proper part in organizing the institution, and raising it to that high
standard of discipline and excellence to which it has since attained. In
the meanwhile, the war department, under the enlightened administration
of Mr. Crawford, had endeavored to supply some of the obvious defects of
the Academy, by new regulations.</p>

<p>So far we have pursued the history of the Academy, as it progressed
from a germinal idea to actual being and life. It is now
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page733" id = "page733">733</a></span>
necessary to trace that system of <i>scientific culture</i> which is its
essential element and peculiar character. In this the student of
education may be more interested, and as we trace it still further, in
its <i>fruits</i>, the education and services of more than two thousand
young men, who have held the most important positions in all the
departments of life, we shall be better able to pronounce a just
judgment upon its merits and services.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class = "smallcaps">Crawford</span>, one of the most
enlightened men who have appeared in public affairs, was, we believe,
the first to understand and attempt to remedy the defects and
irregularities which Professors Mansfield and Ellicott had pointed
out.<a class = "tag" name = "tag10_6" id = "tag10_6" href =
"#note10_6">6</a> In March, 1816, “Rules and Regulations” were drawn up
by Mr. Crawford. The main points in them were&mdash;</p>

<p>1. There shall be a Board of Visitors, to consist of five suitable
gentlemen, who shall attend each annual examination.</p>

<p>2. There shall be a General Examination twice in each year; in July
and December, and an annual vacation in July and August.</p>

<p>3. Cadets shall be admitted in September, and examined in spelling,
reading, writing, and arithmetic.</p>

<p>4. A course of studies, embracing definitely all branches of science
and instruction to be procured, and rules for classification shall be
drawn up, and comprise a complete course of education at the
institution.</p>

<p>According to the last regulation, a course of studies was drawn up by
the Academic Faculty, and approved by Mr. Crawford, in July, 1816. This
course comprised four years, and was substantially the same (although
largely increased,) which has been pursued since.</p>

<p>The <i>first year</i> studies were English Grammar, French, Algebra,
Geometry, and Logarithms.</p>

<p>The <i>second year</i> comprised French, Geometrical Construction,
Application of Algebra, Mensuration, Plain and Spheric Trigonometry, the
Conic Sections, and Drawing.</p>

<p>The <i>third year</i>, Natural and Experimental Philosophy,
Astronomy, and Drawing.</p>

<p>The <i>fourth year</i>, Engineering, Geography, History, and
Ethics.</p>

<p>In the first draft, Engineering was put in the third year; but since
1817, has been placed in the fourth. In a year or two afterwards was
added the Calculus; and in a few years, Chemistry, Mineralogy,
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page734" id = "page734">734</a></span>
and Natural Law. This course of studies is exclusive of the purely
military part, which under the heads of Tactics, Practical Artillery and
Gunnery, occupied several hours each day.</p>

<p>Thus, in July, 1816, the Academy had for the first time arrived at a
course of studies, and a preparation for discipline. In the fall and
winter of 1816, began an attempt to carry this course of studies into
practical effect. We do not say there had been no studies and no attempt
at classification before that, for there were, but that nothing had
really been perfected in either, till after the “regulations” of 1816.
If we could carry the reader back to the year 1815, and see the
difficulties under which the professor of that day labored, the small
material provided, and the undisciplined condition of the young men
under their charge, we should give better views of the merits and
services of its pioneer teachers. One or two reminiscences may possibly
throw some light on the subject. Colonel Mansfield arrived at West Point
in 1814, and immediately sought for his pupils. He was not like the
professors of whom Gibbon speaks, remembering that he had a salary to
receive, but forgetting he had duties to perform. On the contrary, he
immediately asked for pupils to teach. What was he to teach? Philosophy
and Astronomy. But these required prior training, and it was not till
the winter of 1814-’15, that he could find any pupils. Then he found
<i>five</i> young men who thought that they could go on in such studies.
For want of any recitation rooms at the Point, he taught them in the
parlor of his own house. As we shall refer specifically to the subject
of text-books, we merely add, that the only work to be found at all
suitable, was <i>Enfield’s Philosophy</i>. There was no classification,
and in a few months these five cadets were commissioned. They made the
first class in Philosophy, taught at West Point.</p>

<p>Again, there are some who will recollect Professor Ellicott, sitting
at his desk at the end of a long room, in the second story of what was
called the Mess Hall, teaching Geometry or Algebra, looking and acting
precisely like the old-fashioned schoolmaster, of whom it was
written,</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>“And still they gazed, and still the wonder grew,</p>
<p>&nbsp; That one small head could carry all he knew.”</p>
</div>

<p>The cadets were all “boys” to him, and his kind face was long
remembered. In the other end of this room, or in the next, was seen his
acting assistant, Stephen H. Long, then a young lieutenant of engineers;
since distinguished as a traveler, an engineer, and a man of science.
The text-book used was “Hutton’s Mathematics,” and
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page735" id = "page735">735</a></span>
at that time the best to be had. Mr. Hutton had been a professor at
Woolwich, England, and his treatises were plain, simple, easily
understood, and therefore well adapted to beginners. It was, however,
very deficient both in extent and analysis. It was a good text-book
then, for there were no cadets trained to pursue deeper or more
analytical works. With Hutton’s Mathematics, Enfield’s Philosophy, and
plain right-lined drawing, and nothing which could be called
engineering, did the cadets of the Academy get along, without roll,
classification, or graduation, till the close of 1816.</p>

<p>In August, 1817, as we have said, Colonel Thayer became
superintendent at West Point; and in the course of the next four or five
years the Academy passed through the great changes which brought it from
the inchoate to the crystallized state in which it now appears. The most
important of these changes relate to scientific culture; and we shall
best describe them by narrating the <i>actual work</i> the classes then
pursued, and the change of text-books. The first step was taken, as we
have seen, in March, 1816, by the regulations of Mr. Crawford, which
required classification, a course of studies, and annual examinations.
Some steps towards these were taken in 1816, but very imperfectly. In
1817 the system of classification was first systematically begun. <span
class = "smallcaps">Claude Crozet</span>, a French officer under
Napoleon, and a pupil of the Polytechnic School, was appointed professor
of engineering, in March, 1817. The annual examination coming on in
June, the course of studies in his department did not regularly commence
till September, and the second or junior class<a class = "tag" name =
"tag10_7" id = "tag10_7" href = "#note10_7">7</a> of 1817-’18 was the
<i>first</i> class which commenced thoroughly the severe and complete
course of studies at West Point. The <i>labors</i> of that class in the
years 1818 and 1819 may have been equaled, but certainly have not been
surpassed. It was not a brilliant class, but its labors were not the
less on that account. It had not merely to pass over the plain turnpike
road of science which is now made so easy to those who follow; but, like
the pioneers of an army, had to cut down the obstructions, make their
own bridges, and to no small extent, furnish their own munitions. Let us
look into the class-room of 1817, as Professor Crozet advances to
instruct those
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page736" id = "page736">736</a></span>
young men in studies, which were not only new to them, but entirely
unheard of, and in which the language to which they were born and bred
<i>furnished not a single text-book</i>. Professor Crozet was to teach
engineering; but when he met the class, he found not one of them fit to
learn engineering. These were branches of science, and its affiliations,
essentially necessary to engineering, which they had never been taught.
What was he to do? All he could do obviously was to supply these
preliminary studies before he could commence in his own department. In
other words, he must begin by becoming a teacher of mathematics, and
drawing. The surprise of the French engineer instructed in the
Polytechnique may well be imagined when he commenced giving his class
certain problems and instructions, which not one of them could
comprehend or perform. Among these preliminary studies was Descriptive
Geometry, not an original and distinct science, but which by
<i>projecting</i> geometrical figures and problems on co-ordinate
planes, gave a more facile and practical mode of <i>representing</i>
(as&nbsp;its name implies,) as well as solving many geometrical and
practical problems. This, too, required an accurate knowledge of
mathematical and perspective drawing, and its various minor but
important arts. We doubt whether at that time more than a dozen or two
professors of science in this country knew there was such a thing;
<i>certainly</i> they never taught it, and equally certain, there was
not a text-book in the English language. Perhaps this is not surprising,
when we reflect, that this new application of geometry was scarcely
thirty years old. Monge, a French savans, was, we believe, the author of
this system, about the beginning of the French Revolution. Crozet meant
to begin with Descriptive Geometry, but fortunately, the class was not
in the last year of the course (in&nbsp;which engineering has recently
been taught,) and could spare some time for mere mathematics. But, a new
difficulty arose. There was no text-book in English, and none to be had
just then in French. Geometry is not a thing to be taught orally. What
is to be done? It was here at this precise time that Crozet, by aid of
the carpenter and painter, introduced the <i>blackboard</i> and chalk.
It is a very simple thing, and so is every thing which is useful; but we
know of no mere adjunct of teaching, so useful as the blackboard. To
professor Crozet, so far as we know, is due the introduction of this
simple and useful machine. He found it, with many other things, far
superior to the English methods in the Polytechnic of France.</p>

<p>We now see Crozet with his blackboard before him, chalk in hand, and
animated, intellectual face, about to teach his class a new science,
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page737" id = "page737">737</a></span>
without a text-book. Again he meets a new difficulty. He does not more
than half understand the American language. This difficulty is only to
be overcome by practice. With extreme difficulty he makes himself
understood. With extreme difficulty his class comprehend that two planes
at right-angles with one another are to be understood on the same
surface of the blackboard on which are represented two different
projections of the same object. But, at last it is done. The Professor
labors with inexhaustible patience, and the pupils are pleased to
receive into their minds entirely new ideas. The first problems are
drawn and demonstrated on the blackboard, by the Professor; then drawn
and demonstrated by the pupils, and then accurately copied into
permanent drawings; and thus this class were taught in the most
important and valuable method of imparting true knowledge, which has
been given to mankind since the days of Socrates. Fortunately, professor
Crozet had brought with him the complete drawings of the French
Polytechnique, so that he was not, in this particular, obliged to depend
upon himself. The path of his instruction soon became easier, and then
this class completed their course in drawing, mathematics, and
Engineering.</p>

<p>In the study of Natural Philosophy and Mechanics, the way was
scarcely less difficult. We have already said, that Enfield’s Philosophy
was the first book on that subject. But this was not enough. Professor
Mansfield looked around in vain for any suitable book on Mechanics. At
last, <i>Gregory’s Mechanics</i> was adopted. It was a book without any
analysis, and probably written only for scientific men. Yet, it was the
best to be had. For several years after, this work still remained the
best book on Mechanics. Whether the class who first studied its
mysterious pages acquired as clear and extensive ideas of the subject as
those who have since passed over smoother roads, may be doubtful. It is
certain they had more arduous labors. We have said there was <i>no</i>
text-book on engineering, as a science. When the class which had
commenced Descriptive Geometry, with professor Crozet, (then the second
or the junior class,) had become the first class, they were instructed
in engineering by drawings from oral teaching, on the blackboard. The
various modes of laying out fortifications, of bridging, of defiling, of
materials, ordnance, &amp;c., were taught by professor Crozet. For
several years no text-book in engineering was found. It was not till
1823 that a French treatise, entitled the Science of War and
Fortication, was translated by Major O’Connor, and for several years
used as a text-book. It will be seen that the class which, in 1817,
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page738" id = "page738">738</a></span>
1818, and 1819, commenced the new culture and discipline of West Point,
had an arduous and difficult task. It is, notwithstanding, quite
probable, that this severe exercise of the mind, in making paths for
itself, where there are no guide-posts on the way, no regal road, is a
better discipline than that furnished by the more easy and systematic
methods.</p>

<p>Perhaps no one step taken at West Point, has contributed so much to
intellectual culture as the Merit-Roll. The effect at the Military
Academy is totally different from what it would be at any civil
institution. For there it determines <i>rank</i>, which is the great
object of military men. Forty young men may be commissioned on the same
day to the same grade, but through all their after life, even when they
return to civil life, the distinctions of the merit-roll will follow
them, and be counted for or against them. In the very first day of their
commissioned service, the distinction is a practical one, for there are
great and practical advantages in certain <i>arms</i> of the service
over others. Thus the engineer officer, without any actual care of men,
or responsibility for any movements, and almost always stationed at
comfortable posts, has great advantages over other arms. The Artillery
has advantages over the Infantry. Thus the cadet, commissioned from West
Point, has determined for himself, by his position on the merit-roll,
not only his rank in the army, but almost his position in human life.
The merit-roll, as it now exists, graduated in all departments, and
summed up at the close of the course, was not adopted at once, but was
the work of several years.</p>

<p>In February, 1818, the superintendent of the Academy was directed by
the Secretary at War to publish in the Army Register the “names of
cadets who are distinguished for attainments, and meritorious conduct,
not exceeding five in each class, specifying the studies in which they
may excel.”</p>

<p>We well recollect with what excitement and interest this
communication was received by the cadets of that day, especially by
those who thought themselves within the probabilities of that
distinction. It unquestionably stimulated most of the young men to much
greater exertions than they would otherwise have made. In a few months
after, the merit-roll was fully established in the classes, and the rank
of the graduating cadets determined by it.</p>

<p>There has been much discussion, and no small doubt, as to the real
effects of emulation. There is undoubtedly a bad sense, and a bad effect
attached to that term. But is that a necessary consequence of the
merit-roll? Is not the merit-roll adopted, so far as it
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page739" id = "page739">739</a></span>
can be ascertained, in all departments of human life? Who would risk
himself with an ignorant engineer, if he could get a skilled one? Who
would employ a poor clerk if he could get a good one? The objection made
to emulation is that it excites wrong motives. However this may be, and
however casuists may regard it, it is quite certain that the merit-roll
is the strongest stimulant to intellectual exertion which can be
presented to young men. Nor can we perceive, after much observation on
its effect, that it has impaired the purely moral motives of action, or
excited evil passions, to be remembered in after life. At West Point all
the moral actions which are visible and tangible are brought within the
scale of the merit-roll, and often the fate of a young man is determined
far more by his standing in conduct, than in studies.</p>


<p class = "smallhead"><a name = "westpoint_history_extra" id =
"westpoint_history_extra" href = "#westpoint">II. STUDY, DISCIPLINE, AND
FRUITS.</a></p>

<p>Having thus sketched the historical progress of the Academy in the
path of scientific culture, it remains for us to state what it
<i>is</i>; what it has <i>done</i>; and what men have <i>conducted</i>
it.</p>

<p>Without entering into minute details, we shall very briefly state the
present methods of study and discipline. The leading studies in their
order are Mathematics, Natural Philosophy, Mechanics, Astronomy,
Engineering, Chemistry, French, Tactics, Artillery Practice, Mineralogy,
Ethics, and History. This course is wholly scientific, the practical
part being adapted strictly to military purposes. In the early period of
the institution, some attempt was made to introduce the classics, but it
was found impracticable, with the limited time allowed the cadets.
Indeed, it may be doubted whether any institution can have more than one
<i>tone</i>. All branches of human learning may be embraced in the
proper schedule of university instruction; but has any university given
equal attention to all branches of education? What are called colleges
in our country, all aim at fitting young men for the civil
professions&mdash;Law, Medicine, and Theology. They therefore make the
classics the principal branch of study, and are right, since Law,
Medicine, and Theology have their foundation deep laid in the classic
ages. Literature also is a part of professional knowledge, necessary to
adorn and illustrate the history and theory of professional science.
Hence, in these lines of instruction specially have run the studies of
the college, and from these is derived the <i>tone</i> of college
education. The object of the Military Academy was totally different. It
was not civil, but martial life, for which the young men were fitting.
It was neither a metaphysical discussion, nor a hair-splitting argument
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page740" id = "page740">740</a></span>
on the law, in which they were expected to excel. They were to learn the
sterner arguments of the battle-field; to arrange squadrons for the
hardy fight; to acquire that profound knowledge of the science and
materials of nature, which should fit them for the complicated art of
war; to defend and attack cities; to bridge rivers; to make roads; to
provide armaments; to arrange munitions; to understand the topography of
countries; and to foresee and provide all the resources necessary to
national defense. This was the object of the Military Academy, and to
that one end it was adapted. The method of education may be happily
stated under the heads of Studies, Physical and Moral Discipline, and of
Military Exercises.</p>

<p>1. The subjects and method of study we have already mentioned;
Mathematical, Philosophical, Mechanical, Chemical, Military, and French,
the military language. These being the chief topics of study, the
students and the time were suitably divided into classes and hours.
There are four classes, occupying four years, as usual in colleges.
There are ten months of study, the intermission being in the hot months
of July and August, when only military studies and exercises are
pursued. The studies of a day are necessarily modified, by the
introduction of military exercises which consume much time. The regular
<i>study hours</i> (which include also the recitations,) are from 8 A.M.
to 1 P.M., and from 2 P.M. to 4 P.M., making <i>seven hours</i> of study
and recitations. Generally <i>four hours</i> more are consumed in
military exercise and discipline, being the hours before breakfast, and
after 4 P.M. Thus <i>eleven</i> hours are generally occupied either in
study or exercises. The evening also after dark, is devoted to study in
so far that with occasional exceptions, the cadets are required to be in
the rooms. In this division of time we find a <i>continual alternation
of study and exercise</i>; leaving the least possible time for idleness,
or mere amusement. Indeed, the problem of education is to find the
<i>maximum of development</i>, with the <i>minimum of idleness</i>. To
this should be added, that the development should be co-relatively,
intellectual, physical, and moral.<a class = "tag" name = "tag10_8" id =
"tag10_8" href = "#note10_8">8</a> It is not merely ignorance, but
<i>unequal</i> development, which is the great misfortune of mankind.
How many great and glorious intellects have been lost, because there
were no counter-balances to the
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page741" id = "page741">741</a></span>
force which, inclined in only one direction, carried them off into a
wilderness of fruitless objects!</p>

<p>In the course of studies pursued at West Point, the main feature is
the <i>method</i> of study. We can give an idea of this in a few words.
The very first thing done at West Point is to <i>recognize</i> the fact,
that <i>intellects are unequal</i>; in other words, that of a given
number of young men, commencing a severe and elaborate course of
studies, there will be some who can not endure it, and can not get
through; and others, who while they will come up to the requisites for
graduation, can not equal a third class, who are capable and ambitious
of receiving the highest style of education. This recognition is
effected thus: a class enters the Academy, we will say <i>eighty</i> in
number. This class enters on the 1st of September; and on the 1st of
January there is a semi-annual examination. This four months of study by
that class is regarded as a period of <i>probation</i>, which will
furnish some test of the abilities of its several members. When the
January examination is held, some are found deficient, and they are at
once discarded. Then the remaining class are numbered, according to what
is then their <i>apparent</i> merit, and they are divided into
<i>sections</i> of from fifteen to twenty each; those highest on the
roll being placed in the first section; those next in the second,
&amp;c. Usually there are four of these sections. The professor usually
teaches the first section; his assistant the second, and so on. It is
obviously a decided advantage to be in the first section, and there is
usually a struggle to get there. But, a cadet may change his position in
his class, at any time, by his own efforts. This he can only do,
however, by more strenuous efforts. Then, if he be in the second
section, he may at the end of the year be found to have a higher
aggregate of good marks in study and conduct than some of those in the
first section. In that case he will be transferred. Thus the ambition of
the student has always placed before it the possibility of higher class
rank, and if his talents and industry are capable of it, he will attain
it.</p>

<p>The <i>method</i> of study at West Point, which in all institutions
is the important point, is the <i>rigidly demonstrative</i>, in those
studies which admit of it, and the <i>positively practical</i> in those
which do not. The course of studies requires this, if the subjects of
study are to be thoroughly understood. There is little of the purely
metaphysical or transcendental known or pursued at West Point. No
abstract speculations or merely theoretical inquiries occupy their
minds. It is the actually knowing, and doing, in which they are engaged.
As far as can be made practically useful, the <i>oral</i> method
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page742" id = "page742">742</a></span>
is pursued. In mathematical and mechanical, engineering and tactical
studies, this is largely the case. The blackboard, we have said, was
first introduced into this country by Professor Crozet, at West Point.
How largely this is used in all institutions of education now, our
readers well know. It has proved one of the most efficient means of
instruction at West Point. The student of the mathematical section, for
example, begins with a text-book on Algebra, in his hand; but, it is on
the blackboard where the workings of his mind are chiefly exhibited. He
learns what he can from the book, but, on the blackboard the professor
makes him trace out what he has done, not merely by telling what he
knows, but what he don’t know; detects his weak place, and forces his
mind (so&nbsp;far as such force is possible,) to <i>think</i>, and think
rightly on the subject before him. This <i>thinking</i>, we need not
tell experienced teachers, is the great thing which education is to
teach. If a student can not, or will not think studiously and
industriously, he will not long remain at West Point. There is not, as
in civil colleges, the great fallow field of poetry, history, and
metaphysics, in which he may show his classical professor that he has
acquired rich things, although ignorant of mathematics. It will not do
to say that he has wandered with Greeks and Romans around the ruins of
Troy, or by the waters of Babel. There is no such compensating principle
in the system at West Point. The cadet must study what is set before
him; must study it hard; must think upon it, and discipline his mind to
systematic modes of thought.</p>

<p>2. This leads us to the Specific Discipline of the Academy. This is
partially included in what we have already said. The intellectual
discipline is mainly maintained by the method of study; but there is a
grand and perfect system of discipline, which we may briefly describe.
The term <span class = "smallroman">DISCIPLINE</span> is derived from
disciples, <i>discipulus</i>, and means originally <i>teaching</i> of
knowledge; but this is not all, nor entirely its modern sense.
Discipline is <i>training</i> in knowledge and virtue, in order and
diligence, in good conduct, and good habits. To do this requires a
control of the body as well as mind; of food and raiment; of time and
exercise; as well as the imparting of facts and ideas. It was in the
former sense rather than of the latter, that the word <span class =
"smallroman">EDUCATION</span>, (to&nbsp;lead forth,) was understood
among the ancients, and so far as they went they were right. It was this
<i>discipline</i> in virtue, temperance, courage, fortitude, and
self-denial, which was taught in the days of Persian Cyrus, and Greek
Leonidas. It was adopted among the early Christians; but, Cowper well
said:&mdash;</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page743" id = "page743">743</a></span>
<div class = "verse">
<p>“In colleges and halls in ancient days,</p>
<p>&nbsp; When learning, virtue, piety, and truth</p>
<p>&nbsp; Were precious, and inculcated with care,</p>
<p>&nbsp; There dwelt a sage called Discipline.</p>
<p class = "emspace">&nbsp;*****</p>
<p>&nbsp; But Discipline, a faithful servant long,</p>
<p>&nbsp; Declin’d at length into the vale of years,”</p>
</div>

<p>Nothing can be more certain than the decline of “discipline” in
modern civil institutions. “Colleges and Halls” advertise a much
enlarged course of studies; they call to their aid the most learned
professors; and they proclaim “all the modern improvement,” and yet it
is quite certain, that a pupil can walk for years their learned halls,
and at last receive the honors of graduation with a very small share of
either learning, diligence, or virtue. Civil institutions may be most
excellent for all, who either by early care or natural inclination are
willing to use their opportunities for their intellectual or moral
advancement. Nay, more, all open irregularities will be corrected, and
all possible means afforded for spiritual improvement. But there are two
things impossible to overcome&mdash;the popular and almost universal
license allowed youth, (under the name of freedom) and the total want of
any ultimate power to restrain it. These stand directly in the way of
thorough discipline. At a Government Military Institution, this is
directly reversed. The very first thing taught is <i>positive
obedience</i>. The cadet can not be a week at West Point without knowing
that he can not govern himself, but must be governed by others. If he is
either not fit or not willing, the faculty meet the case in short and
decisive language: “If you are either unable or unwilling to pursue the
course of study and discipline, we direct you must instantly go. There
are plenty more worthy to fill your place.” There is, then, no
alternative for the cadet but to go forward, and exert himself to the
utmost, or not to go at all. There can be no loitering by the way, to
slumber in idleness, or waste in dissipation, or pursue the pleasures of
literature. There is no doubt that this stern and constant discipline is
the great merit of West Point. It acts on the whole conduct and
character. We have already said, that the class-standing determined by
the merit-roll, determined their position relatively, and their rank in
the army, and by consequence, great distinctions and differences in
after life.</p>

<p>Let us see how this merit-roll is made up. The <i>first</i> thing
done is to <i>mark</i> each cadet with a <i>figure</i> (having relation
to an agreed scale of numbers,) for every act done or undone, in study,
conduct,
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page744" id = "page744">744</a></span>
drill, attention, &amp;c. The <i>second</i> is to agree upon the
<i>relative values</i> of each study, conduct, &amp;c., in aggregating
the whole positive or negative performance of a cadet, in his whole
course at West Point. The summation of these for any one year gives his
class-standing for that year, and the summation for the whole course
gives his standing at the time of graduation, and his rank in the
army.</p>

<p>Formerly, and we believe yet, the mode of marking and summing up for
standing, was this. Each professor or teacher marked for one performance
one of seven marks, from -3 to +3.&nbsp;This being purely artificial may
be changed. But it is in this way the marking is made. Then in regard to
<i>relative values</i> of study and conduct, the scale formerly
was:&mdash;</p>

<table class = "plaintext numbers">
<tr>
<td>Mathematics,</td>
<td>300.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Philosophy and Mechanics,</td>
<td>300.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Engineering and Military Science,</td>

<td>150.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>French,</td>
<td>100.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>100.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>To obtain 2,100, the aggregate, a cadet must never have failed in a
recitation, or been absent from a military duty, or derelict in the
least particular. This most rarely if ever happens. Not to fall short
more than 100, is evidence of very high standing.</p>

<p>It is evident, that under this system, emulation is highly excited,
and, in fact, there must be a constant, unremitting effort to graduate
at all. The general result is, that not more than one-half of all
appointed are graduates. At the first semi-annual examination, many drop
off; several more at the end of the first year, and more at the end of
the second. Nearly all who survive the second year are graduated.</p>

<p>The only remaining point, peculiar to the system at West Point, is
that of Military Exercises. As a Military Institution, this is a
necessity, but it has also a great advantage as a means of Physical
Education. This is a kind of education too much neglected, and for which
civil colleges afford little opportunity, and no encouragement. The
ordinary games, amusements, and walks in the field are relied upon to
afford development to the body, and the natural tastes the only guide.
So thought not Persian statesmen, Greek Philosopher, or Roman Senator.
In contrast, a systematic
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page745" id = "page745">745</a></span>
education of the body was a principle, and a practice, with all the
civilized nations of antiquity. There was a constant attention to this
in the training of youth; and the Olympian Games, the Gymnastic
Exercises, and the Gladiatorial Shows, all had reference to this
principle. If heathen nations could thus wisely attend to the healthy
development of their bodies, can Christian people safely neglect it?
There is no question that the Christian law of temperance, daily labor,
good temper and amiable dispositions will do much to preserve health and
strength. The health of the mind goes far to make the health of the
body; but we must recollect that all students, properly so
called&mdash;men who are set apart for the cultivation of learning and
science&mdash;the <i>savans</i> of a country, are cut off at the very
beginning, from that <i>daily labor</i> of the body, which in the dawn
of human history was declared to be the necessity of man’s existence.
There is, therefore, a positive need of supplying by some system of
salutary exercises, the place of that labor in which the farmer and
mechanic are constantly exercised. What shall it be? Our common
classical institutions have left this almost entirely to the student’s
own choice. Several hours of the day are left to the student to employ
as he pleases. Does not experience prove, that he is quite as apt to
employ this in novel reading, or playing cards, or visiting, or
(in&nbsp;the case of an ambitious pupil,) in studying or reading the
classics, as in any systematic method of exercise? Let the early dead of
consumption, the victims of dissipation, and the unhappy subjects of
chronic diseases, teach the living, that education consists not merely
in spurring the mind on to intellectual feats, however admirable. The
bird soars through the mid-heavens, but soars on the strength of his
wings; and if he had the soul of Socrates, would still fall, when they
are exhausted.</p>

<p>The military exercises, at West Point, accomplish some great results.
They give an admirable exercise to the body, and they occupy time which
might be wasted, and they compel the cadets to give up late night
studies. Let us begin with the last. Nothing is more common among the
ambitious students of colleges, than to sit up late at night. To burn
the midnight oil, in order to accompany every thought in the realms of
Plato, or fight with Hector on the plains of Troy, or pursue the phantom
of metaphysics, or the genius of literature through the bright worlds of
fiction, is the common boast of scholars. They have little thought, till
too late, that life was shortened, and happiness impaired, by every hour
taken from the natural period of rest. At West Point this evil is
avoided, not so much by force of command, as by that of wise
arrangements.
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page746" id = "page746">746</a></span>
At the dawn of day, even in the shortest days, the shrill fife and
rolling drum summon the cadet to his morning duties, and with the
exception of the hours of meals, there is one incessant pressure upon
him for bodily and intellectual labor, till ten at night. The results of
this is, that when the hour of retirement comes, he must have more than
human strength, who is not ready and willing to lie down and sleep.
There are, of course, exceptions; but, at West Point, they are rare. The
lights are put out at 10 o’clock, and the weary student is ready to
retire. Thus, the system of discipline at the Military Academy at once
strengthens the body, stimulates ambition, prevents idleness, and
compels the mind to pursue the objects of reason, rather than the charms
of imagination.</p>

<p>Having thus traced very briefly the history, studies, and discipline
of West Point, it is only just to say something upon the fruits it has
produced. These are divided naturally into two classes; the work of the
<i>Professors</i>, and the performance of <i>Graduates</i>. The former
is little noticed in the accounts of our colleges, except in the
reputation of some distinguished men; but the latter, (the divines,
lawyers, and statesmen who have graduated,) make the glory and the
ornament of the triennial catalogue. Let us see if something has not
been produced by West Point, which, in regard to the peculiar objects
and teaching of the Academy, may bear a favorable comparison with the
catalogue of any institution for the last half century. We do not mean
in regard to the learned professions, for if West Point had excelled in
these departments, it would have utterly failed in those for which it
was made. But, we mean in the great field of science and of usefulness.
First, let us look at some of the fruits produced by its professors,
especially in the production of <i>text-books</i>. In the history of
instruction at West Point, we have stated the total absence in the
beginning, of text-books on some subjects, and the unfitness of those on
others, even the common studies of Mathematics. The first text-book on
Descriptive Geometry, published in America, and we believe, the English
language, was prepared by Professor <span class =
"smallcaps">Crozet</span>; but, as he then understood our language
imperfectly, and had little taste for authorship, it was soon
supplanted, by a complete treatise prepared by Professor Davies. On that
subject, as on the subject of Engineering, there was no systematic
treatise; and for a time, West Point got along by oral teaching, and
such collateral aid as could be had. The utter deficiency of suitable
books may be known by the fact, that the first really tolerable
text-books on mathematics were translations of La Croix, Bourdon, Biot,
&amp;c., French authors. The French methods
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page747" id = "page747">747</a></span>
of writing and teaching science are, on most topics, the best. Their
style is clear and analytical. The English treatises are clumsy, being
what is called in literature, elliptical, having vacancies in the
reasoning, to be supplied by the student. The next great and permanent
improvement in books, were the mathematical works of Professor <span
class = "smallcaps">Davies</span>, a graduate of 1815, when the Academy
was yet in a chrysalis state; he was several years a teacher before he
conceived the idea of supplying a new series of mathematical text-books.
His first plan was to adopt the best French works as a basis, and modify
them, so as to be adapted to the American course of instruction. In this
manner were prepared “Davies’ Legendre,” (Geometry,) and subsequently
“Davies’ Bourdon,” (Algebra.) Other treatises were prepared on his own
plan, and thus, for many years, Professor Davies pursued the quiet and
laborious task (independent of other avocations,) of preparing an entire
course of mathematical text-books. In time he modified these again, so
as to fit them for the best colleges, and the higher schools. From the
smallest mental arithmetic, to the profoundest treatise on the Calculus,
he has produced clear and admirable text-books on every topic of
mathematical studies. Many other good books have been prepared by
professors in colleges, but there is no part of the United States in
which some one of Davies’ works is not taught in schools and colleges.
Gradually, the civil institutions have been, in some degree, brought up
to the standard of West Point, in mathematical studies.</p>

<p>In more recent years, Professor <span class =
"smallcaps">Bartlett</span> has published his treatise on Optics;
Professor <span class = "smallcaps">Church</span>, on the <span class =
"smallcaps">Calculus</span>, and Professor <span class =
"smallcaps">Mahan</span>, on Field Fortification, and a treatise on
Civil Engineering. Various other works on military subjects have been
contributed to the stock of knowledge, by graduates of the Academy.<a
class = "tag" name = "tag10_9" id = "tag10_9" href =
"#note10_9">9</a></p>

<p>Thus have the graduates of West Point, by disseminating in textbooks,
and teaching the higher knowledge, and better methods pursued there, in
fact, and beyond dispute, <i>elevated the entire standard of education
in this country</i>. Contrast, for example, the text-books of Day,
Hutton, Enfield, Gregory, &amp;c., which were the only ones to be had on
mathematical science in 1818, with those now in use at West Point, New
Haven, or Princeton. Contrast the methods of
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page748" id = "page748">748</a></span>
study before the blackboard, the art of drawing, the system of rigid
demonstration, and of exact scales of merit were introduced, with those
now in use in the higher schools of science, and we shall be satisfied
that West Point has done a great and most useful work in elevating the
standard of education. This is one fruit of its production, which has
been altogether too lightly estimated. If it be of importance to
increase the number of blades of grass, it is of much more importance to
increase the number of minds fitted to enjoy the works of God, and use
beneficially the gifts with which he has intrusted them.</p>

<p>A more obvious and commonly remarked fruit of West Point, is the
<i>men</i>, laboring in their vocations, which it has produced. It is
impossible here, (though it would be a labor of love,) to note the
individual examples of merit and usefulness, among those whom West Point
has sent into the service of their country. We are here limited rather
to a statement of general results. It may be done briefly; and since we
have seen no Register later than 1850, we must deal in round numbers.
These, however, will approximate the precise facts. They are there
statistically:&mdash;</p>

<p>Numbers have resigned, and died young, not above enumerated, and
numbers of these also have died in the civil service. We have made this
classification to show how largely West Point has contributed to
education, civil engineering, and the professions. These were not the
direct objects of the Academy; but, when long years
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page749" id = "page749">749</a></span>
of peace presented no duties but that of the garrison, and no glory to
the profession of arms, it was natural and proper for active and
ambitious young men to seek honor and usefulness in other pursuits. Nor
did the government discourage this, for it foresaw what has happened,
that these young men, so highly educated in science, would diffuse this
knowledge throughout the country; elevate the standard of education, and
be ready when their country needed their services. This has happened.
A&nbsp;better knowledge of the exact sciences has been carried into the
colleges; the railroads and canals have been built by engineers ready
furnished by the government; and now when half a million of men have
been suddenly called to war, they have been largely officered by the
graduates of West Point. Here we may briefly allude to the most grave
fact which has been urged against the Military Academy. The best
officers of the rebel army were educated there. Why is this? Is there a
want of sound morals? or, is loyalty no virtue there? Neither. A part,
and <i>a part only</i><a class = "tag" name = "tag10_10" id = "tag10_10"
href = "#note10_10">10</a> of the graduates born and grown up in the
south, have gone with their friends, families, and connections, into the
rebel service. This was on account of social ties, and had no more to do
with West Point, than had other rebels from Harvard, or Yale, with those
institutions. The noticeable fact is that they were educated at the
government expense, and therefore under peculiar obligations to the
country. But we find a parallel in the numerous officers of the state,
as well as of the army and navy, who had been honored and rewarded at
the public expense, but who thought it no shame to betray their country,
and conspire against its life. We in vain attempt to account for such
crimes, except upon the principle of common depravity, of which history
has furnished similar examples in all ages of the world.</p>

<p>We have come to the end of the work we proposed. The rise, progress,
and fruits of the Military Academy, we have briefly, and, we trust,
justly delineated. Certainly, we have no end to serve, no prejudice to
gratify. We knew the Academy in its early and immature period. We have
seen it grow up to usefulness and honor. We see its graduates taking
their places among those who have well served their country, and well
deserved its laurels. In this we are <i>glad</i>. But our memory is
filled with other images. We see West Point, in the now lengthening
shadows of time. We seem to see those with whom we studied freshly
present, as they
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page750" id = "page750">750</a></span>
walk the green plain, or sit before the class, or strive to teach our
dull and inattentive minds. They were men worth remembering, and when,
in after times, we became their friends, rather than their pupils, still
more pleasant memories gathered around them. We seem to see the
venerable <span class = "smallcaps">Ellicott</span>, like Goldsmith’s
schoolmaster, alike full of learning, and of kindly humor; the placid
and intellectual expression of <span class =
"smallcaps">Mansfield</span>, whose abstracted looks seemed to be
searching the higher philosophy; the courtly and dignified <span class =
"smallcaps">Thayer</span>, whose graceful manners and attractive
conversation can not be forgotten by any who knew him; and the amiable
<span class = "smallcaps">Courtnay</span>, who though of later date,
will long be remembered. He left the world in doubt, whether he was the
better scholar or the better man.<a class = "tag" name = "tag10_11" id =
"tag10_11" href = "#note10_11">11</a></p>

<p>Of these, and of those like them, do we think, when we think of West
Point. Nor of those alone; the place itself, where nature delights in
the sublime and beautiful, rises before us. No imagination is necessary
to clothe it with the hues of poetry; no books to recall the lost
passages of history; no labored eulogy to bring up the memories of the
dead. You can no more forget them, than you can the Pilgrims, when
standing by the rock of Plymouth. Yon gray and moss-covered ruin was
once the fortress of the Revolution. Yon scarcely perceptible pile of
stones marks the spot where its soldiers were hutted in the winter. Yon
slightly raised turf, beneath the dark shades of the cedar, was his
grave, and soon, perhaps even now, that slight memorial will be gone
forever. Yon little valley under the shadows of the mountain, recalls
the illustrious name of Washington. Yon blue mountain-top tells of the
beacon fires he lit. All around are memories; all around are sacred
spots. If the Greek remembers Marathon; if the Jew lingers at Jerusalem,
or the Christian pilgrim grows warm at Bethlehem, so should the American
remember West Point; linger round the ruins of Fort Put, and gaze with
delight on the blue summit of Beacon Hill.</p>

<p class = "smallhead">DEVELOPMENT OF INSTRUCTION AT WEST POINT.</p>

<p>1. Down to 1802, the instruction of the Cadets attached to the Corps
of Artillerists and Engineers stationed at West Point, according to Act
of Congress (May 7th, which was all that repeated recommendations of
Washington and other experienced officers could obtain), was confined to
military drill and practical exercises in common with other members of
the Corps; but as that Corps was made up of the scientific officers of
the army, and as military works were in construction under their plans
and superintendence, these exercises were of great practical value, and
the appointment of these Cadets in 1794, and their gathering at West
Point, may be regarded as the nucleus of the Military Academy.</p>

<p>2. The Military Academy, established with that name, by Act of March
16, 1802, in pursuance of a Bill reported in 1800, by the Committee of
Defense in the House of Representatives, of which Harrison Gray Otis was
chairman, and to which an elaborate report of the Secretary of War
(James McHenry, of Maryland), had been referred&mdash;consisted of the
Corps of Engineers, which by the Act was organized distinct from that of
Artillery, and could not exceed in officers and cadets, twenty members.
The Corps was stationed at West Point, and its officers and cadets were
subject to duty in such places as the President should direct. The
principal engineer was made superintendent, and down to 1808 he was
instructor in fortifications, field-works, and the use of instruments.
Two officers of the rank of captain, appointed without previous military
experience, but with special reference to their knowledge of
mathematics, gave instruction in that branch, “one in the line of
geometrical, and the other of algebraic demonstration.”</p>

<p>In 1803, two teacherships&mdash;one of the French language and the
other of Drawing, was attached to the Corps of Engineers, and in 1804,
F. De Masson was appointed to discharge the duties of both.</p>

<p>In 1808, the basis of the Military Academy, so far as related to the
number of Cadets, was enlarged by the addition of two for each new
company of Infantry, Riflemen, and Artillery, added to the military
force; and the number in the Act of 1812, is limited to 250, which with
the ten originally attached to the Corps of Engineers, fixed the
strength of the Cadets at 260.</p>

<p>By the Act of April 29, 1812, the Corps of Engineers was enlarged,
and was again constituted the Military Academy, and in addition to the
teacher of the French language, and Drawing, provided in Act of Feb. 28,
1803, one Professor of Natural and Experimental
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page752" id = "page752">752</a></span>
Philosophy; one Professor of Mathematics; one Professor of Engineering
in all its branches; and for each an Assistant Professor taken from the
most prominent characters of the officers or cadets, are provided for;
and for the purposes of military instruction, it is ordered that the
students shall be arranged into companies and officered from their own
members, to be taught all the duties of a private, non-commissioned
officer, and officer; and for instruction in all matters incident to a
regular camp, shall go into camp for at least three months of each year,
and erecting buildings and providing apparatus, library, and all
necessary implements, the sum of $25,000 is appropriated. By this act
the minimum of age is fixed at 14, and the literary qualifications of
candidates on entering are to be well versed in reading, writing, and
arithmetic.</p>

<p><span class = "firstword">A military</span> officer, not usually

control over both the studies and discipline of the institution. He
renders all prescribed returns, and addresses his communications to the
<i>inspector</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>inspector</i> of the Academy is an officer of rank in the army
named by the Secretary of War, who has his residence at Washington, and
through whom all general orders relating to the Academy are transmitted
to the superintendent at West Point. He makes an inspection of the
Academy at least once in each year.<a class = "tag" name = "tag10_13" id

<p>The general staff of the Academy consists of an adjutant, a
quartermaster, a treasurer, one surgeon, and two assistant surgeons.</p>

<p>Although the system of the Academy as regards the training of the
cadets both in and out of study is peculiarly and rigidly military, the
staff of instruction is separate from the staff of discipline.</p>


<p class = "heading"><i>Military Staff.</i></p>

<p>The cadets are organized into a battalion of four companies.</p>

<p>The <i>commandant of cadets</i>, usually not under the rank of
lieutenant-colonel in the army, exercises the immediate command of the
battalion. He is also, <i>ex officio</i>, principal instructor in
infantry, artillery, and cavalry <i>tactics</i> (signifying drill).</p>

<p>Under the commandant are six <i>assistant instructors of tactics</i>,
viz.&mdash;one for artillery; two for infantry; one for cavalry; one for
artillery and infantry; one for infantry and cavalry. The four senior of
these officers command the four cadet companies respectively; the two
junior officers being always available to perform the routine duties of
the others in case of absence. The assistant instructors must be
officers of the army.</p>

<p>The battalion is provided with a full complement of <i>cadet</i>
officers, and non-commissioned officers, who are appointed by the
superintendent from a list submitted by the commandant of cadets.</p>

<p>To each company are appointed</p>

<p>The cadet companies are composed indiscriminately of the four classes
into which the students are divided according to their respective years
of residence, the period of residence being four years for all.</p>

<p>The cadet officers are taken from the first, or senior class; the
sergeants from the second class; the corporals from the third class. The
selection is not made with special reference to proficiency in study.
Those are selected who have manifested the greatest military aptitude
and respect for discipline in their own conduct; although <i>cœteris

<p>The Academic Board consists of the Superintendent, the Commandant of
Cadets, the Professors of the Academy, and the Instructors of Practical
Military Engineering, and of Ordnance and Gunnery.</p>

<p>All the professors and instructors, with their assistants and acting
assistants, have been educated at West Point, with exception of the
chaplain, the professors of French and Spanish, and the sword master.
All are regularly enrolled in the military service of the United States,
and subject to military discipline.</p>


<p class = "heading"><i>Professors and Assistants.</i></p>

<p>The professor or chief instructor in each branch is responsible for
the efficiency and uniformity of the system of instruction in his own
department. To this end he has no special class or section assigned to
him for tuition. His time is devoted to general superintendence, and is
chiefly spent in visiting the halls of study of his assistants. He does,
however, take the instruction of the different sections, each in their
turn, as he sees fit, and occasionally assembles all the sections of his
department for lecture.</p>

<p>The assistant and acting assistant professors or instructors are
always appointed from among officers on the full pay of their regiments
who have graduated at the Academy, on the recommendation of the
professor or chief instructor of the branch in which there is a vacancy
to be filled. These assistants are carefully selected through means of
the data of their proficiency, temper, and general character, afforded
by their record of four years’ residence as cadets. They are, thus, all
of them previously well known to the professors to whom they are to act
as assistants, and to whom they are naturally inclined to defer from old
associations.</p>

<p>The term of duty at the Academy of the assistant and acting assistant
professors and instructors is fixed at four years, at the end of which
period they return to regimental service. Duty at the Academy is
obligatory on every officer who may be selected for it, and is
considered as part of the general service which every officer who has
graduated at West Point, owes to the country; practically those only are
selected to whom the duty is not disagreeable.</p>


<p class = "heading"><i>Admission</i></p>

<p>Each congressional or territorial district of the United States
(<i>i.e.</i> each district entitled to return a member to Congress), is
by law entitled to have one cadet receiving education at the
Academy.</p>

<p>The nominations are made in each year by the Secretary of War, on the
recommendation of the representatives in Congress of the several
districts then unrepresented at the Academy, or whose
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page756" id = "page756">756</a></span>
representatives are about to quit the Academy. In addition to these, the
President of the United States may nominate ten cadets in each year, to
be selected according to his own will and pleasure, from the community
at large.</p>

<p>The number of vacancies at West Point in any one year varies
according to the number of cadets who happen to complete their period of
residence, and of those, who, not having completed their term, are yet
discharged as deficient in studies or discipline, as hereafter
explained. The number of yearly admissions varies from 50 to 70.</p>

<p>The date of admission in each year is the 1st of July, and the
candidate for admission is required to report in person to the
superintendent before the 31st of May, with a view to his qualifications
being tested. But if sickness or any other unavoidable cause should
interfere, he may present himself on the 28th of August. Except at the
two periods above named, no admissions can take place.</p>

<p>Candidates must be over 17 and under 22 years of age, except in the
case of any candidate who may have served faithfully as an officer or
enlisted man in the army of the United States, either as a volunteer or
in the regular service during the late civil war, who may be admitted up
to 24 years of age.</p>

<p>Candidates must be at least five feet in height; free from any
deformity, disease, or infirmity which would render them unfit for
military service; and from any disorders of an infectious or immoral
nature. They must be able to read and write well, and be thoroughly
versed in the first four rules of arithmetic, in reduction, in simple
and compound proportion, and in vulgar and decimal fractions.</p>

<p>Although the examination for entrance is not difficult, the
prescribed tests, both medical and intellectual, are rigidly applied,
and many candidates are rejected.</p>

<p>The examination for entrance is not competitive, but simply a
qualifying examination. The competitive system commences after a cadet
is once admitted; it enters into every branch of instruction, and
continues in full force to the end of his residence.</p>


<p class = "heading"><i>Subjects and Course of Study.</i></p>

<p>The length of the course of study, for all who may succeed in
graduating, is four years; its nature, after the first year, is
principally professional, and the course of study is identical for all
the students. The subjects are not all studied simultaneously, separate
periods of the course being devoted to certain subjects, as shown by the
time tables annexed.</p>

<p>The relative importance of the different subjects is indicated by
<span class = "pagenum">

<p>Practical instruction in surveying; in fortification; in ordnance and
gunnery, including the loading, pointing, and firing heavy guns; in
drill, or, as it is termed, the tactics of the three arms; in interior
economy and regimental duty; forms an important part of the training of
the cadet at different periods during his residence. In addition, the
months of July and August in each year are entirely devoted to practical
instruction, the battalion being then placed under canvas and relieved
from all study.</p>

<p>During his first year a cadet receives instruction in fencing three
hours in each week, from 10th October to 1st April.</p>

<p>During his second year he receives instruction in riding three hours
in each week, from 1st November to 15th March.</p>

<p>Throughout the whole of his third academic year, from 1st October to
1st July, he receives instruction in riding, excepting between the 1st
February and 15th April.</p>

<p>Throughout the whole of his fourth academic year he receives
instruction in riding, three days in each week.</p>

<p>Swimming is not taught at the Academy. There is a good gymnasium for
the use of the cadets in recreation hours, but the practice of
gymnastics is purely voluntary.</p>


<p class = "heading"><i>Classification for Instruction.</i></p>

<p>The cadets are ranged in four distinct classes, corresponding with
the four years of residence. Cadets of the first year constitute the
fourth class; those of the second year, the third class; and so on.
Cadets are promoted from one class to another at the end of the academic
year, 30th June; provided only that they shall have
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page758" id = "page758">758</a></span>
passed satisfactorily before the Academic Board in the examinations
which are always held during June, failing in which, they are either
kept back in their then class for another year, or, in the case of
decided deficiency, discharged from the Academy.</p>

<p>Each class is divided into sections convenient for instruction in the
different branches of study. The method of division will be best
explained by taking the fourth or lowest class as an example.</p>

<p>The members of the fourth class are, on their admission to the
Academy, arranged in alphabetical order, and are then formed into
sections, averaging about 12 cadets for each branch of study. After the
lapse of a month, transfers are made at the close of each week from one
section to another, according to the results of the past week’s
attendance in study, and so continue until those most advanced are found
in the first section; the next in order, in the second section; and so
on.</p>

<p>During the first six months of residence, cadets are on probation,
and only receive their <i>warrant</i> as cadets, provided they shall
have passed satisfactorily at the January examinations held before the
Academic Board, and that their conduct shall have been satisfactory.</p>

<p>Before receiving his <i>warrant</i>, each cadet is required to sign
an engagement of service in the United States army for eight years, and
to take an oath of allegiance to the National Government and
Constitution.</p>

<p>The hours allotted to study are divided nearly equally between
attendance on the instructors in the halls of study&mdash;or <i>section
rooms</i>, as they are termed&mdash;and independent study in quarters.
The attendance in the section rooms is termed <i>recitation</i>; the
independent study in quarters, <i>study</i>.</p>

<p>The theory is, that during each recitation, every cadet of the
section attending it, shall receive a thorough <i>viva voce</i>
examination illustrated on the blackboard, and there is not much
practical variation therefrom. Where there is any departure from it, it
arises from the number of cadets in a section being too large to enable
them all to be examined during the same recitation, which lasts an hour
and a half, or an hour, according to the subject. Recitations in
mathematics, in natural and experimental philosophy, and in civil and
military engineering, occupy one hour and a half; in all the other
branches of instruction, only one hour. Thus, when it appears in the
time table that a class attends mathematics, for example, from 8 to 11,
it is to be understood that the sections forming one half of the class
attend their respective teachers in the section rooms during an hour and
a half, while the other half of the class
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page759" id = "page759">759</a></span>
is engaged in study in quarters. At the end of the first hour and a half
those sections which have attended recitation return to their quarters
to study, while their places are taken by the remaining sections which
have been up to that time engaged in study in quarters.</p>

<p>Each teacher, as a general rule, has two sections specially assigned
to him for instruction, excepting the professor or head of each
department who, as has been already explained, devotes his time to
general superintendence, and takes the different sections for his
personal instruction at such times and in such order as he may judge
best.</p>

<p>Before proceeding to the section rooms the different sections parade
in the barrack square by sound of bugle, under the superintendence of
the cadet <i>officer of the day</i>; the roll is then called by the
senior cadet, who is termed the <i>section marcher</i>, who reports
absentees to the officer of the day, and marches his section off to the
section room by direction of the latter. Arrived in the section room,
the section marcher causes the cadets to take their seats in the order
of their names on the roll, and then hands them over to the instructor.
When dismissed by the instructor, the section marcher forms his section
as before, marches it back to the barrack square, reports all
infractions of discipline which may have taken place either in study or
on the march to the officer of the day, and then dismisses his section
by the latter’s permission.</p>

<p>There is no system of private tuition recognized at the Academy. Each
cadet must depend on his own exertions, aided by the explanations given
by the instructors in the section rooms, and by the occasional
assistance he may derive from his more advanced comrades.</p>

<p>The allotment of so large a portion of time to independent study is a
great departure from the practice of military schools in Europe; and it
is a remarkable feature in the West Point system that no continued
supervision is exercised over the cadets when studying in quarters
beyond that which is supplied by the discipline of the cadets
themselves. The senior of the two cadets inhabiting each room is
responsible for discipline and orderly behavior. The officer of the day
(cadet) visits each room during the hours of independent study; and the
<i>officer in charge</i>, who is detailed daily from the assistant
instructors of tactics, also visits the rooms at his discretion.</p>


<p class = "heading"><i>Routine of Daily Work.</i></p>

<p>A full-dress parade of the battalion takes place every day at sunset,
after which the cadets are marched to supper, the hour of which
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page760" id = "page760">760</a></span>
varies with the season of the year, but is never earlier than 5.30 p.m.
Half an hour after supper the evening call to quarters is sounded for
study in barracks until tattoo at 9.30.&nbsp;All cadets excepting
officers, the non-commissioned officers of the battalion staff, and the
first sergeants, must be in bed and their lights extinguished at 10
p.m., the hour for the signal of <i>Taps</i>.</p>

<p>The arrangement of time on Sundays is as follows:</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>Breakfast at 7 a.m.</p>
<p>Full-dress parade and inspection at 8.</p>
<p>Call to quarters for <i>study in barracks</i> at 9.</p>
<p>Church call at 10.30.</p>
<p>Recreation after church.</p>
<p>Dinner at 1 p.m.</p>
<p>Recreation.</p>
<p>Call to quarters for study, 3 to 5 p.m.</p>
<p>After 5 p.m. the arrangement of time is the same as on a week
day.</p>
</div>

<p>Cadets may obtain leave from the Sunday afternoon study in barracks
to attend church a second time, should they desire it.</p>

<p>There is no yearly vacation. When a youth enters West Point, he is
fixed there, unless discharged, for four years without intermission,
with the exception of two months’ furlough which he may obtain at the
end of his second year on certain conditions, and which is subject to a
scale of diminution graduated according to misconduct.</p>

<p>This discipline would be intolerably severe but for the relaxation
afforded by the change from barracks and the section room to camp life.
The battalion is encamped from about 20th June to 30th August, and
during that period the time is exclusively devoted to military
exercises, practical instruction, and amusement.</p>

<p class = "heading"><i>Proficiency in Study&mdash;Examinations.</i></p>

<p>The system of estimating proficiency in the different subjects
studied is very elaborate. Each instructor keeps daily notes of the
proficiency of the cadets forming the sections of which he has the
charge; the degree of excellence shown by a cadet at any recitation
being recorded by marks, 3 being the maximum for each lesson, which
represents <i>thorough</i> proficiency; 2.5 signifies <i>good</i>; 2
<i>fair</i>; 1.5 <i>tolerable</i>; 1 <i>very imperfect</i>; any thing
below 1 is recorded as 0, or complete failure.</p>

<p>A weekly report showing the daily credit of each cadet and the
aggregate for the week, is handed in by each instructor to the professor
or head of his department at the end of the last study on Saturday, and
the professor personally delivers the weekly reports of his department
to the superintendent at the office of the latter between the hours of
12 and 2 p.m. on the same day. The professor
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page761" id = "page761">761</a></span>
at the same time recommends such transfers of students from section to
section as he may think proper. The aggregate weekly credits of each
cadet in all the branches of instruction are then recorded in the
superintendent’s office.</p>

<p>From the weekly class reports, and the monthly record of discipline,
a consolidated report of the progress of the Academy is made up monthly
and forwarded to the inspector of the Academy, who transmits an abstract
of the same to the parent or guardian of each cadet.</p>

<p>The weekly class reports form the most important element in
determining the relative standing of the cadets in their class at the
period of graduation, but a verifying test, or corrective, is supplied
by the examinations which take place in January and June, the method of
conducting which is as follows:</p>

<p>The January examinations commence on the 2d of the month. The
examination of the 4th or lowest class is conducted by the whole
Academic Board, the constitution of which has been already detailed. The
relative standing of the members of the fourth class, up to that time
arranged alphabetically, is then determined by the summing up of the
weekly class reports, verified or corrected by the results of the
examination. A&nbsp;large proportion of the cadets of the fourth class,
usually from one-sixth to one-eighth of the whole, are yearly pronounced
to be <i>deficient</i>, and removed from the Academy at this their first
examination, which on account of its importance is required to be
conducted by the whole Academic Board. The examinations of the three
other classes take place before committees of the Academic Board, the
whole Board being divided into two committees for this purpose.</p>

<p>The June, or <i>annual</i> examinations, commence on the first of the
month. The first or graduating class alone is examined by the entire
Academic Board, and the final relative standing of the cadets
determined. The remaining classes are examined before the two committees
of the Academic Board.</p>

<p>The June examinations take place in the presence of the <i>Board of
Visitors</i>, the members of which are specially appointed in each year
by the President of the United States, and whose duty it is to report to
the Secretary of War, for the information of Congress, on the state of
discipline, instruction, &amp;c., &amp;c., of the Academy.</p>

<p>The senior assistant professor or instructor of the branch under
examination is <i>ex officio</i> a member of the Academic Board or of
the committee thereof which conducts such examination; and the immediate
instructor of the section to be examined is likewise associated
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page762" id = "page762">762</a></span>
with the Board or its committee so far as relates to the examination
itself and the arrangement of the section in order of merit.</p>


<p class = "heading"><i>Classification according to Marks.</i></p>

<p>To assist the Academic Board in determining the accurate
classification of any section about to be examined, the immediate
instructor of that section hands to the Board, before the examination
commences, a roll in the order of merit in which he considers the
members should stand, based on the weekly credits which he had himself
assigned.</p>

<p>At the close of the examination the same instructor hands to the
Board a second roll in the order in which he conceives the members of
the section should stand, judging by the result of the examination. The
instructor then retires and the Board proceeds to deliberate.</p>

<p>Each member of the Board having kept careful notes of the
examination, the relative standing of the cadets of a section in
proficiency is determined by discussion.</p>

<p>The question next arises, who, if any, are to be pronounced
<i>deficient</i>?&mdash;a dictum which inevitably entails discharge from
the Academy, or putting down to a lower class.</p>

<p>The different sections composing the class, having been arranged in
one class list in order of merit; one of the Board, usually the
professor of the department concerned, supposing <i>e.g.</i> the class
to consist of 50 members, may move that No. 50 be declared deficient. If
the motion is negatived on discussion, the salvation of No. 50 proves
also the salvation of all standing above him. But if the motion be
carried, Nos. 49, 48, 47, &amp;c., may be pronounced deficient in like
manner, and so on, until a number is reached which is not condemned.</p>

<p>The examinations are entirely <i>vivâ voce</i>. Each cadet is
subjected to a searching oral examination of from seven to ten minutes,
illustrated on the blackboard where the subject admits of it. The daily
record of the proficiency of a cadet in any subject forms, as already
stated, by far the most important element in fixing his relative
standing among his classmates: it is only exceptionally that the public
examinations alter materially the order of merit which has been
previously framed from the weekly class reports.</p>

<p>At the close of each examination the Academic Board reports to the
Secretary of War the names of all cadets who are pronounced deficient in
studies or discipline, to be discharged from the Academy unless
otherwise recommended by the Academic Board.</p>

<p>The rule of discharge for deficiency, even in one solitary subject,
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page763" id = "page763">763</a></span>
is very rigidly enforced; unless where exceptional circumstances, such
as loss of time on account of illness, or having been unavoidably
prevented from joining the Academy until some time after the rest of his
class, induce the Board to recommend that the cadet shall have another
trial by being put back to the next lower class.</p>

<p>Some detail is necessary to explain how the marks obtained by a cadet
at the daily recitations are employed to determine the credit he is to
receive in any given branch of study at the period of his
graduation.</p>

<p>Where a subject is studied for two years, the maximum time allotted
to any branch of study, the marks gained during the first year help only
to fix a cadet’s relative standing in his class for the year next
ensuing. The credits shown by the weekly class reports of the second
year alone are taken into account in determining the credit due to a
cadet at the end of his residence.</p>

<p>The exact method of fixing the credits due for any one subject is as
follows. The professor makes out a roll of the class in the order of
merit finally fixed by the Academic Board at the June examinations. The
first on the roll then receives credit for the maximum number of marks
allotted to the subject; the last on the roll receives a credit of
one-third of that maximum only. The <i>common difference</i> for all the
members of the class between those limits is then calculated, and the
remaining members receive credits varying from the first cadet and from
each other by the amount of that common difference. The figures thus
determined represent the credits assigned for any one subject at the
period of graduation, and the figure of general merit for each cadet is
made up of the aggregate credits obtained by him for all the branches of
study, with one column included for discipline.</p>

<p>Proficiency in drill or riding does not affect the figure of general
merit, except indirectly. Inattention or carelessness at these exercises
would be noted by a certain figure of demerit, and would thereby
diminish, as will be hereafter explained, the credit to be allotted for
discipline at the final examination.</p>


<p class = "heading"><i>Graduation.</i></p>

<p>The qualifications required for obtaining an appointment to the army
are simply <i>graduation</i>, or in other words that a cadet shall have
passed through the four years’ course at the Academy without being found
<i>deficient</i> in any one branch of study or in discipline. The
proportion of cadets who fail to graduate is very
considerable&mdash;nearly one-half. The present first class is a fair
sample. It numbered
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page764" id = "page764">764</a></span>
74 on entrance, and its members are now only 39, and of these three had
belonged to the next higher class, and were put back for deficiency.
From 1842 to 1852 the exact proportion who succeeded in graduating was
0.510. From 1852 to 1862 the exact proportion was 0.523.</p>

<p>Although the ultimate consequences of idleness in being declared
<i>deficient</i> at the half-yearly examinations are generally
sufficient to insure diligence, an immediate penalty is attached to any
adverse report against a cadet for want of attention to study, or any
misconduct in the recitation halls. The instructor of any section notes
on his weekly class reports any cases of decided idleness and all
infractions of discipline, and to each reported instance a double
penalty is attached, as to every instance of misconduct at the Academy;
the one immediate, in punishment according to the scale of the offense;
the other prospective, consisting of a certain figure of demerit, which
will rise up in judgment against the delinquent at the end of his
residence, and diminish his credit for <i>discipline</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>certainty</i> of the penalty which attaches to idleness, both
in the immediate punishment it entails, and its more serious ultimate
consequences, is found to be sufficient, as a general rule, to attain
the desired object; hence the character of the cadets for diligence is
decidedly high.</p>

<p>The members of the graduating class have their choice of the services
to which they shall be appointed according to their standing on the roll
in order of merit. The order of precedence of corps of the United States
army is: 1, Engineers; 2, Ordnance; 3, Artillery; 4, Cavalry and
Infantry; and that is, as a general rule, the order of choice. The
Secretary of War may sanction subsequent transfers from one branch of
the service to another, but such transfers are very rare.</p>

<p>Beyond the privilege of choice, the only direct inducement held out
to distinction among his classmates to any cadet, is one which is purely
honorary. By an order from the Secretary of War so early as the year
1818, the five cadets most distinguished in studies and discipline in
each class at the June examinations, are published each year in the
United States Army Register (Army List). The distinction is highly
prized.</p>

<p>The advantages resulting from a degree or peculiar distinction at
West Point after appointment to the army, in respect to professional
advancement or the obtaining staff employment, are very small. No
special qualification is required by law or regulation for admission to
the staff. When a vacancy occurs any one who desires may
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page765" id = "page765">765</a></span>
make application for the vacant appointment to the Adjutant General of
the army. The decision rests with the Secretary of War or the President.
The head of the department in which the vacancy exists is the proper
person to insist, if he thinks proper, on the possession of certain
qualifications by the officer who is to be employed as his subordinate.
Even graduation at West Point is not insisted on as a necessary
qualification for staff employment.</p>


<p class = "heading"><i>Discipline.</i></p>

<p>Every young gentleman who passes his probationary examination in the
January after his admission, receives his <i>warrant of cadet</i>, and
signs an engagement to serve in the military force of the United States
during the eight years next ensuing. He thus becomes amenable to the
articles of War and to trial by court-martial.</p>

<p>The discipline of the Academy has no resemblance to that of an
ordinary civil college, but is peculiarly and essentially military. The
cadets are required to clean their own rooms, make their own beds, and
clean their own arms and belts.</p>

<p>The staff for the maintenance of discipline is distinct from that of
tuition. The professorial staff simply report infractions of discipline
in study, but have no power to punish. All professors and instructors,
however, as well as all military officers who may be stationed at West
Point, are expected to report to the superintendent any improper conduct
on the part of a cadet which may come under their observation.</p>

<p>The punishments to which a cadet is liable are comprised in the three
classes following, viz.:&mdash;</p>

<p>1st. Privation of recreation, &amp;c.; extra duty (not guard);
reprimands; arrests or confinement to barrack room or tent; confinement
in light prison. <i>Inflicted only by the superintendent or by his
authority.</i></p>

<p>2d. Confinement in dark prison. <i>Only by sentence of court-martial,
and seldom or never resorted to.</i></p>

<p>3d. Suspension; dismissal with privilege of resigning; public
dismissal. <i>Only by sentence of a garrison or general court-martial,
which must be approved by the Secretary of War.</i></p>

<p>“Breach of arrest” is treated as a military offense of the worst
nature, and is classified with “mutinous conduct.”</p>

<p>All offenses are classified under five heads, and are recorded
according to the following scale:</p>

<table class = "allwords">
<tr>
<td>An offense of the</td>
<td>1st</td>

<td>5</td>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page766" id = "page766">766</a></span>
<p>All offenses reported or to be reported against cadets, are read out
at evening parade on the day after commission, excepting offenses in the
section rooms reported by the instructors, which are read out on Monday
evening’s parade; so that every cadet may have the opportunity of
presenting a written explanation, or plea, in extenuation, of the
offense charged against him.</p>

<p>The commandant of cadets attends at his office, in the square of the
cadet barracks, between the hours of breakfast and the first study every
morning to receive reports of offenses.</p>

<p>Explanations in writing, on paper of prescribed uniform size, may be
taken to the commandant by any cadet charged with an offense not later
than the commandant’s second orderly hour after publication, as a
general rule from which any departure requires to be explained.</p>

<p>If the commandant considers the excuse satisfactory, he erases the
offense and tears up the excuse, but forwards an abstract of all
offenses which have not been explained to his satisfaction, with the
written explanations, for the decision of the superintendent.</p>

<p>The superintendent may, on further inquiry, find the explanations of
some of the offenses forwarded satisfactory, in which case he erases
such offenses. To the remainder he allots such immediate punishment, and
such marks of demerit in addition, as the cases respectively justify; or
he may consider the demerit marks sufficient without any immediate
punishment.</p>

<p>Thus the offenses of which a cadet may be guilty during his residence
are recorded against him by a very elaborate and just method, and rise
up against him at the period of his graduation. No instance of
carelessness or inattention to orders is too trifling to be taken notice
of.</p>

<p>If any cadet has more than 100 demerit recorded against him in any
six successive months, he is immediately discharged from the Academy as
deficient in discipline.</p>

<p>But during the first year’s residence, offenses count one-third less
than those committed during the subsequent three years; a cadet of the
first year would therefore only be discharged as deficient in discipline
who had obtained a demerit of 150 within any period of six successive
months.</p>

<p>The marks of demerit of all the fourth class cadets who have not
proved deficient in discipline, are wiped out entirely at the end of
their first year, and do not therefore affect their relative standing at
the period of graduation. The demerit of the first year is only taken
into account, so as to determine, in combination with the
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page767" id = "page767">767</a></span>
credits received for progress in study, the relative standing of the
cadets in their class for the year next ensuing.</p>

<p>At the final examination, the credit to be allotted to any cadet on
the score of discipline is made up by means of the demerit rolls as
follows.</p>

<p>Each cadet receives a credit of 16.67 for every month during his
residence, in which he has had no demerit recorded against him, to be
deducted from his aggregate marks of demerit at the end of his
residence. The monthly credit is fixed at 16.67, because that number
forms the sixth part of the 100 marks of demerit, which if recorded in
six months against any cadet would have occasioned his discharge.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding that the demerit marks of the fourth class are wiped
out at the end of the first year, and do not count against the cadets at
their final examination, the credit of 16.67 is still allowed to cadets
for every month of their first year in which no demerit was recorded
against them and deducted from their aggregate marks of demerit at the
end of their residence.</p>

<p>The positive marks of merit for discipline due to any cadet at the
end of his residence are thus determined. The cadet of the graduating
class having the lowest aggregate demerit recorded against him is placed
<i>first</i> in discipline, and is credited with the maximum of marks
due to that subject, viz., 300. The whole class is then arranged in the
same sense, the cadet having the highest demerit being placed last, and
receiving only one third of the maximum, viz. 100. The common difference
between these limits is then calculated for each cadet of the class, and
applied as already explained.</p>

<p>Although the nominal value placed on discipline is represented by the
same number of marks only as are allotted to each of the more important
branches of study, in fixing the relative standing of cadets at their
final examination; it should be remembered that no candidate can reach
that period at the Academy who is not fairly well conducted. It would be
quite impossible for any cadet to remain at the Academy who had earned
for himself the sentence “deficient in discipline,” even though the
marks of demerit required for that sentence might have been earned by a
succession of minor infractions of discipline. And a cadet who might be
guilty of any serious willful offense would be at once removed from the
Academy.</p>

<p>Owing to the very limited time allowed for recreation, games are
almost unknown; and almost the only athletic amusement indulged
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page768" id = "page768">768</a></span>
in is boating on the river, for which, however, Saturday afternoons
afford the only available time.</p>

<p>No difficulty is found to arise from the difference of age among the
cadets in maintaining an uniform system of discipline. The same rules
are applied to all during the whole period of residence.</p>

<p>The cadet officers and non-commissioned officers greatly assist in
maintaining discipline. A&nbsp;daily abstract of offenses show that out
of 15 offenses recorded therein, 11 were reported by cadet officers or
non-commissioned officers.</p>

<p>The daily duties are assimilated as much as possible to those of a
battalion in quarters, and are as follows:</p>

<p><i>The officer in charge</i>, detailed daily from the assistant
instructors of tactics, is responsible for the proper performance of all
the military duties of the battalion during the day. His tour of duty
commences at guard mounting (7.30 a.m. in barracks, 8 a.m. in camp); at
which time he reports for orders to the commandant at the office of the
latter. He has an office adjoining that of the commandant where he must
constantly be present from <i>reveillé</i> to <i>taps</i> (the signal
for putting out lights at 10 p.m.), except when absent on duty or at
meals. He is present in the cadets’ mess hall during all meals, and
superintends every parade and roll call. He visits the sentries at his
discretion. On being relieved, he includes in the usual morning report
of his company, all offenses which may have come to his knowledge as
having occurred during his tour of duty.</p>

<p><i>The officer of the day</i>, is detailed usually from the roster of
the cadet officers, although every cadet of the highest class is
appointed at least once to perform this duty. He is present at guard
mounting and receives his guard in the usual military manner, after
which he reports for order to the commandant and is generally under the
orders of <i>the officer in charge</i>. His post of duty is the guard
room, which is in the same building as, and immediately beneath, the
offices of the commandant and the officer in charge. He causes all calls
to be sounded at the proper time; is present at all parades and roll
calls; and receives reports of all absentees, whom it is his duty
immediately thereafter to seek and to order when found to repair to
their respective duties unless properly excused. He reports to the
officer in charge all absentees whom he may not be able to find, and all
cadets who fail to obey his orders. He directs the formation of all the
class sections before marching to the section rooms; receives reports of
absentees from the section marchers, and requires the latter to march
off their sections in a proper military manner. He is responsible for
the suppression of
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page769" id = "page769">769</a></span>
all irregularities in quarters or their vicinity during his tour. He
visits the quarters during the hours of independent study and receives
reports of absentees. He visits all the quarters at <i>Taps</i>, and
reports absentees to the officers in charge. He afterwards visits the
room of every cadet absent every 15 minutes until the return of the
absentee, or until otherwise directed by the officer in charge. On the
back of the guard report which he forwards next morning to the
commandant, he records all offenses which come to his knowledge as
having occurred during his tour; and presents with it all permits and
passes that have come into his hands, all of which are required to be
deposited with him. The officer of the day is relieved from study during
his tour of duty.</p>

<p><i>Daily Guard.</i>&mdash;A cadet guard, consisting of one sergeant,
four corporals, and 24 privates, is mounted every morning at
7.30.&nbsp;The cadets of the guard remain in the guard-room during the
day, excepting the hours of study.</p>

<p><i>Sentries</i> are posted during the hours of recreation, the most
important posts being the different entrance halls of the cadet
barracks. Ten minutes after the <i>call to quarters</i>, during the day
on Sundays, and every evening, it is the duty of each such sentry to
visit all the rooms belonging to his particular entrance hall. He then
orders all cadets whom he may find visiting in rooms not their own to
their proper quarters, and reports all who fail to comply promptly with
his orders to the sergeant of the guard, as well as all absentees; and
the sergeant of the guard passes on all such reports to the officer of
the day. A&nbsp;sentry similarly reports every irregularity that may
occur on his beat, and particularly the name of any cadet who may have
absented himself from the barracks for more than ten minutes.
A&nbsp;high sense of the honorable confidence reposed in a sentry seems
to be generally entertained; and there is every reason to believe that
the cadet sentries at West Point perform their duties in a trustworthy
and satisfactory manner.</p>

<p>The general duties of the battalion are assimilated as much as
possible to those of a battalion in quarters. The daily detail of duties
is drawn up by the cadet adjutant. The cadets for guard are detailed by
the first sergeants of their respective companies at each evening
parade, and the daily routine is in this respect as nearly as possible
the same as that of military life.</p>

<p>There is no yearly vacation; and the furlough which each cadet may
obtain at the end of his second year is subject to the following
conditions, viz.:&mdash;</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page770" id = "page770">770</a></span>
<p>1st. If he has obtained 350 demerit in the two preceding years, he is
detained twelve days; if 325, 300, 275, 250, or 200 demerit within the
same period, he is detained ten days, eight days, five days, three days,
or two days respectively.</p>

<p>2d. He is required to sign a certificate, declaring that he has in
<i>no manner improperly interfered with, or molested or injured new
cadets</i>. The furlough of any cadet declining to sign this certificate
is limited to one month, from 28th July to 28th August. Although there
have been instances of cadets declining to sign this certificate, it is
probable that, as a general rule, the cadet conscience places a liberal
interpretation on the words of the formula.</p>

<p>Leave of absence from the Academy for one to two days is occasionally
granted, but only for exceptional reasons.</p>


<p class = "heading"><i>Buildings.</i></p>

<p>The <i>cadet barrack</i> is a handsome stone building of four
stories. It contains 176 rooms, of which 136 are cadets’ quarters, 14
feet by 22 feet, arranged in eight divisions, each division having its
own entrance, and having no interior communication with the other
divisions. Not more than two cadets are lodged in the same room. The two
beds in each room are curtained off from the room, and separated from
each other by a partition. There are numerous bathing rooms in the
basement, to which the cadets have access.</p>

<p>Each division of quarters is under the superintendence of an
assistant instructor of tactics, who visits the rooms of his division
three times in the course of each day, and occasionally during the
night. He makes a daily report in writing to the commandant of the
condition of the rooms under his charge, noting all delinquencies that
may have come to his knowledge since his last report.</p>

<p>A division of quarters is divided into two <i>subdivisions of
quarters</i> of two floors each, each subdivision being under the charge
of one of the cadet officers, who has his quarters therein, and who is
responsible for the discipline of his subdivision, and for the proper
fulfillment of all orders that may be issued relative to the police of
quarters. He visits all the rooms of his subdivision 30 minutes after
reveillé, and immediately after <i>taps</i> (lights out), notes all
irregularities, and makes a daily report in writing to the
superintendent of his division, recording all delinquencies, and
certifying that since the report of the previous day he has faithfully
performed all duties required of him as <i>inspector of
subdivision</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Academy</i> is a building detached, containing the following
rooms and departments, viz.:&mdash;</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page771" id = "page771">771</a></span>
<p><i>Chemical department</i>, comprising laboratory, lecture-room, room
for electrical experiments, and a work-room; <i>fencing department</i>;
<i>gymnasium</i>; <i>mineralogical collection</i>; <i>engineering
department</i>, comprising drawing and model rooms; <i>artillery model
room</i>; <i>mathematical model room</i>; <i>drawing academy</i>;
<i>trophy room</i>; <i>picture and statue galleries</i>;
<i>mineralogical section rooms</i>; and 10 <i>recitation rooms</i>
(or&nbsp;halls of study).</p>

<p>Another detached building contains the <i>observatory</i>; and
<i>library</i> of 20,000 volumes, to which the cadets have access at
stated times.</p>

<p>There are no rooms specially set apart for day rooms, reading or
recreation rooms.</p>

<p>The <i>mess hall</i> is a detached building. The central hall where
the cadets take all their meals is 96 feet by 46 feet and 20 feet high.
Quarters for the purveyor with kitchen and bakery, and with quarters for
the necessary servants in the basement, are attached.</p>

<p>The cadets are formed in the barrack square previous to each meal,
and are marched to and from the mess hall. The officer in charge visits
the mess hall at all meal times. The senior cadet officer present is
responsible for good order.</p>

<p>The <i>Riding School</i> is detached and is admirably adapted to its
purpose.</p>


<p class = "heading"><i>Expenses.</i></p>

<p>The Academy is entirely supported by the State. The average annual
cost for 62 years has been $137,315; and this sum includes the cost of
all buildings and structures, of repairs and maintenance. The yearly
appropriations during the last eight years have varied from $170,000 to
$200,000, but does not include certain sums which are paid out of the
regular appropriation to the War Department.</p>

<p>A new cadet is admitted to the Academy on the 1st of July. From that
date he is credited with Government pay at the rate of $30 a month,
which allowance is calculated as sufficient to pay for the whole cost of
his equipment and maintenance. As the monthly pay is, however, small
compared with the first cost of uniforms and outfit, a new cadet usually
deposits with the treasurer of the Academy on entrance from $60 to $80,
to be credited to his account. Thenceforth all wants and necessaries are
supplied to the cadet by the Government, the prices being a trifle above
cost and charged against his account. At the end of his residence, a
balance is struck, and the sum standing to his credit, if any, is paid
over to him. It is possible by this arrangement for a very careful and
steady lad to secure his education, his maintenance during four years, a
position in the army, and $100 in addition, at the time of his
graduation.</p>

<span class = "submini">RELATIVE TO</span><br>
<span class = "subhead">THE ADMISSION OF CADETS INTO THE MILITARY
ACADEMY.</span></h4>

<p><span class = "firstword">Applications</span> for admission into the
United States Military Academy at West Point, should be made by letter
to the Secretary of War. By provision of law, each Congressional and
Territorial district, and the District of Columbia, is entitled to have
one cadet at the Military Academy, and no more. The district
appointments are made on the nomination of the member of Congress
representing the district at the date of the appointment. The law
requires that the individual selected shall be an actual resident of the
Congressional district of the State or Territory, or District of
Columbia, from which the appointment purports to be made. Also,
appointments “at large,” not to exceed ten, are annually made.
Application can be made, at any time, by the candidate himself, his
parent, guardian, or any of his friends, and the name placed on the
register. No preference will be given to applications on account of
priority; nor will any application be entered in the register when the
candidate is under or above the prescribed age; the <i>precise age</i>
must be given; <i>no relaxation of the regulation in this respect will
be made</i>; nor will any application be considered in cases where the
age and other qualifications of the candidates are not stated. The fixed
abode of the candidate, and <i>number</i> of the Congressional district
which he considers his permanent residence, must be set forth in the
application. The pay of a cadet is $30 per month, to commence from his
admission into the Military Academy, and is considered ample with proper
economy, for his support.</p>

<p>The appointments will be made annually in the month of February or
March, on the applications made within the preceding year. The claims of
all the candidates on the register will be considered and acted upon. No
certain information can be given as to the probable success of the
candidate, before the arrival of the period for making the selections.
Persons, therefore, making applications, must not expect to receive
information on this point.</p>

<p>As a general rule, no person will be appointed who has had a brother
educated at the institution.</p>


<p class = "smallhead">QUALIFICATIONS.</p>

<p>Candidates must be over sixteen and under twenty-one years of age, at
the time of entrance into the Military Academy; must be at least five
feet in height, and free from any deformity, disease, or infirmity,
which would render them unfit for the military service, and from any
disorder of an infectious or immoral character. They must be able to
read and write well, and perform with facility and accuracy the various
operations of the four ground rules of arithmetic, of reduction, of
simple and compound proportion, and of vulgar and decimal fractions.</p>

<p>It must be understood that a full compliance with the above
conditions will be insisted on&mdash;that is to say&mdash;the candidate
must write in a fair and legible hand, and without any material mistakes
in spelling, such sentences as shall be dictated by the examiners; and
he must answer promptly, and without errors,
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page778" id = "page778">778</a></span>
all their questions in the above-mentioned rules of arithmetic: failing
in any of these particulars, he will be rejected.</p>

<p>It must also be understood, that every candidate will, soon after his
arrival at West Point, be subjected to a rigid examination by an
experienced medical board; and should there be found to exist in him any
of the following causes of disqualification, to such a degree as will
immediately, or in all probability may at no very distant period, impair
his efficiency, he will be rejected:</p>

<p>1. Feeble constitution and muscular tenuity; unsound health from
whatever cause; indications of former disease; glandular swellings, or
other symptoms of scrofula.</p>

<p>2. Chronic cutaneous affections, especially of the scalp, or any
disorder of an infectious character.</p>

<p>3. Severe injuries of the bones of the head; convulsions.</p>

<p>4. Impaired vision from whatever cause; inflammatory affections of
the eyelids; immobility or irregularity of the iris; fistula
lachrymalis, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p>5. Deafness; copious discharge from the ears.</p>

<p>6. Loss of many teeth, or teeth generally unsound.</p>

<p>7. Impediment of speech.</p>

<p>8. Want of due capacity of the chest, and any other indication of a
liability to a pulmonic disease.</p>

<p>9. Impaired or inadequate efficiency of one or both of the superior
extremities on account of fractures, especially of the clavicle,
contraction of a joint, extenuation, deformity, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p>10. An unnatural excurvature or incurvature of the spine.</p>

<p>11. Hernia.</p>

<p>12. A varicose state of the veins, of the scrotum and spermatic cord,
(when large,) sarcocele, hydrocele, hemorrhoids, fistulas.</p>

<p>13. Impaired or inadequate efficiency of one or both of the inferior
extremities on account of varicose veins, fractures, malformation, (flat
feet, &amp;c.,) lameness, contraction, unequal length, bunions,
over-lying or supernumerary toes, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p>14. Ulcers, or unsound cicatrices of ulcers likely to break out
afresh.</p>

<hr class = "mid">

<p>The above Regulations were issued by the War Department in 1862.
Although it appears from this official document, that “applications for
admission into the United States Military Academy at West Point, should
be made by letter to the Secretary of War,” and that “the claims of all
candidates on the register will be considered and acted upon,” it is
also stated, that “<i>the district appointments are made on the
nomination of the member of Congress representing the district at the
date of the appointment</i>.” This delicate duty, and great privilege of
selecting, out of all the young men between the ages of sixteen and
twenty-one years, in a Congressional district of at least 70,000
inhabitants, who aspire to serve their country in a military capacity,
the one <i>best</i> qualified, or even <i>well</i> qualified, is not
imposed or conferred directly by law, but by the practice of the
appointing power, on the member for that district.</p>

<p class = "heading"><i>Summary of Qualifications (in&nbsp;Circular of
1871).</i></p>

<p>A sound body and constitution, a fixed degree of preparation, good
natural capacity, an aptitude for study, industrious habits,
perseverance, an obedient and orderly disposition, and a correct moral
deportment are such essential qualifications that candidates knowingly
deficient in any of these respects should not, as many do, subject
themselves and their friends to the chances of future mortification and
disappointment, by accepting appointments to the Academy and entering
upon a career which they can not successfully pursue.</p>


<p class = "heading"><i>Method of Testing the Qualifications of
Candidates.</i></p>

<p>Candidates should be able to <i>read</i> with facility from any book,
giving the proper intonation and pauses, and to <i>write</i> portions
that are read aloud for that purpose, spelling the words and punctuating
the sentences properly. Some historical work should preferably be
chosen, and successive passages read till the reading exercises are
ended. Then, from another part of the book, a suitable paragraph or
paragraphs, of reasonable length, should be read aloud to the
candidates, with proper intonations and pauses, as a guide to
punctuation, and written down by them as read.</p>

<p>In Arithmetic they should be able to perform with facility examples
under the four ground rules, and hence should be familiar with the
tables of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and be
able to perform examples in reduction and in vulgar and decimal
fractions, such as:</p>
</div>

<p>Add ⅔ to ¾; subtract ⅖ from ⅚; multiply ¾ by ⅞; divide ⅖ by ⅜</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>Add together two hundred and thirty-four thousandths, (.234,)
twenty-six thousandths, (.026,) and three thousandths, (.003.)</p>

<p>Subtract one hundred and sixty-one ten thousandths (.0161) from
twenty-five hundredths (.25.)</p>

<p>Multiply or divide twenty-six hundredths (.26) by sixteen thousandths
(.016.)</p>

<p>They should also be able to change vulgar fractions into decimal
fractions, and decimals into vulgar fractions, with examples like the
following:</p>
</div>

<p>Change 15/16 into a decimal fraction of the same value.</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>Change one hundred and two thousandths (.102) into a vulgar
fraction.</p>

<p>In simple and compound proportion, examples of various kinds should
be given, and the candidates should understand the principles of the
rules followed.</p>

<p>In English Grammar candidates should exhibit a familiarity with the
nine parts of speech and the rules in relation thereto; should be able
to parse any ordinary sentence given to them, and, generally, should
understand those portions of the subject usually taught in the higher
academies and schools throughout the country, under Orthography,
Etymology, Syntax, and Prosody.</p>

<p>In Descriptive Geography they should name, locate, and describe the
natural grand and political divisions of the earth, and be able to
delineate any one of the States or Territories of the American Union,
with its principal cities, rivers, lakes, seaports, and mountains.</p>

<p>In History they should be able to name the periods of the discovery
and settlement of the North American continent; of the rise and progress
of the United States, and of the successive wars and political
administrations.</p>

<p>The examinations in Orthography, Grammar, Geography, and History may
be either oral or written.</p>

<p>Candidates undoubtedly deficient in any one requisite, or more than
one, should resign any expectation of admission till the deficiency is
overcome.</p>

<p>Candidates should first be examined by a medical practitioner, with
reference to the physical requirements and disqualifications set forth
in the circular; such as are manifestly disqualified being so
informed.</p>

<p>The condition of body and mind considered together should be
regarded, as well as general proficiency in the studies as a whole.
Especially should natural ability and manifest aptitude for acquiring
and applying knowledge take precedence of mere scholastic finish and
readiness of answer to former problems. Other things being equal,
preference should be given, in order, to those whose claims are
strengthened by military, naval, or other distinguished service rendered
to the country by themselves or their immediate relatives; and it is
better for candidates to be nearer the minimum than the maximum age.</p>

thereon to the War Department through the Inspector, who appears to have
been from the start the senior officer of the corps of Engineers.</p>

<p>In 1846 (Aug. 8), Congress authorized the appointment annually, by
the President, of a Board of Visitors, whose duty it was made to attend
each yearly examination, and report to the Secretary of War upon the
discipline, instruction, police and fiscal affairs of the Academy. The
members were to be taken from one half of the number of States,
alternating yearly with the other half, each member being a <i>bona

Congressional district being in turn designated to furnish an appointee.
Of the members each year, not less than six must be taken from among
officers actually serving in the militia.</p>

oftener than once in three or four days. The presence of visitors was
almost wholly unknown, and the officers and cadets formed a community by
and of themselves. The relations existing between the officers and
cadets was like that at present existing between the officers and
soldiers at a military post. Cadets were permitted to visit at the
quarters of professors and officers on Saturday afternoons, and at no
other time. But so reserved were the manners of officers, even on such
occasions, that the privilege, though recognized, was very rarely
exercised. There was substantially no social intercourse between the
officers and the cadets.</p>

<p>In those days, too, the rigor of discipline put all cadets, the sons
of the rich and the sons of the poor, upon a common footing. The
regulations not only prohibited any cadet from receiving money from his
parents and friends, but no place existed, or was permitted to exist, on
the limits, where cadets could expend money. Occasionally a cadet was
allowed to purchase what he pleased under the head of “sundries;” not
exceeding one dollar in amount, and that only on the order of an officer
in charge.</p>

<p>But all this has changed. West Point is now or fast becoming a place
of fashionable resort. Hotels have been erected in near proximity to the
post, and hundreds of visitors now repair thither where one did in
former years. This influx of fashionable life has caused a relaxation of
the rules in regard to cadets visiting. The great distance between
officers and cadets has been gradually diminished. Cadets of the first
class may now visit officers every day in the week, and officers and
cadets associate together with a freedom of intercourse not formerly
known. Insensibly the standard of discipline has been lowered, until the
Academy has less than formerly the character of the Regular Army, and
more the features of a militia establishment, where officers and men are
separated while on duty, but mingle in social intercourse when the hour
of drill or parade has passed.</p>

<p>Although the regulation in regard to cadets receiving money remains
unchanged, yet, at present, a new functionary, known as the “cadet
confectioner,” is allowed to keep open on cadet limits a place of resort
which cadets are known to frequent daily to enjoy the table, and where
they may treat their fellows without stint or limit. Thus one of the
elements of equality which formerly existed among the cadets is
destroyed, and the son of a wealthy man may fare sumptuously, while the
poor boy must confine himself to such food as the mess-hall affords.</p>

<p>Many other causes might be mentioned as contributing to the present
condition of things, and many other illustrations of the change from the
custom of former years might be given. But those members of the board
who have been appointed by the Vice-President and Speaker of the House
of Representatives, and whose duty it is by law specially made to report
to Congress upon this subject, will doubtless do so at length, and
therefore this board pass the subject without as full a consideration as
would otherwise be demanded. But this board, feeling the importance of a
high state of discipline to the efficiency of the Academy, to accomplish
the purpose for which it is maintained, earnestly recommend a return to
the stricter kind of discipline which was administered years ago. An
army must be governed by different methods and upon different principles
from a civil society and to an army and to every military establishment
discipline is a necessity.</p>

<p>With a view to this end, in the opinion of this board, the
superintendent and commandant of cadets should always be officers of
high rank, who, by their age and military distinction, can command not
only the respect but the implicit obedience of the cadets.</p>

<p>The Board of Visitors invited by the Secretary of War to visit the

internal police, discipline, and fiscal concerns of the institution, and
communicate the results of their observations, with any suggestions for
the improvement of the Academy,” consisted of the following members:</p>

</div>

<p>The Visitors introduce an account of their inspection with the
following remarks:</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>Some of our number came with objections and prejudices against the
Academy. But all doubts as to the value and importance of the
institution were banished by the evidence presented in the course of our
personal inquiries into its present condition and actual results. The
Mexican war clearly evinced the value of military science. Still more
has the present war demonstrated the necessity of maintaining, and even
enlarging our Military Academy.</p>

<p>This Academy belongs to the whole nation. So far as its purpose and
numbers permit, it is the Peoples’ College. It is maintained for the
special benefit of no particular section, sect, party, or class. We
could discover no evidence of aristocracy, exclusiveness, or caste. The
Cadets represent all sects and parties, and almost all nationalities,
now naturalized among us. The poor are not denied its privileges, for
the expenses of all are paid alike. If particular dogmas have at any
time prevailed here, the fact is an accidental, rather than an essential
one, and should be referred to the ruling influences at the seat of
government, and not to any inherent element in the local organization at
West Point.</p>
</div>

<p>Their Report has been communicated to the Secretary, by whom the same
will be transmitted to Congress&mdash;to receive such attention as the
Secretary and Congress may see fit to bestow on its various suggestions.
By permission of the Secretary, we transfer to our pages, that portion
of the Report in which the subject of the Admission of
Cadets&mdash;their number, age, attainments, and mode of appointment, is
discussed with considerable fullness.</p>


<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page784" id = "page784">784</a></span>
<p class = "smallhead">ADMISSION OF CADETS.</p>

<p>In concluding the report of their inspection of this, the only
national military school, to which the country naturally looks for the
organization and command of her armies, and the construction of her
works of defense, the Visitors would respectfully urge on the
consideration of the Department, an immediate and thorough revision of
the law and regulations relating to the admission of Cadets&mdash;the
number, the qualifications required, and the mode of ascertaining these
qualifications, and of making the appointments. No matter how
appropriate may be the location, how complete the buildings and
equipment, and how skillful and faithful the teachers, unless there is a
constant and sufficient supply of pupils of the right age, character,
bodily and mental vigor and aptitude, as well as aspirations for a
military career, the public will be disappointed in the practical
workings of the institution.</p>

<p>1. The number of pupils in the Military Academy is determined by the
law, which limits the Cadet Corps of the United States Army to one cadet
for each Congressional District in the several States, one for each
Territory, one for the District of Columbia, and to forty more, whom the
President may appoint, ten each year, from the country at large, without
reference to their residence. Under this law, if each Congressional
District and Territory were represented, the whole number of cadets
would be two hundred and eighty, but owing to vacancies by withdrawal or
non-appointment in Congressional Districts in the States involved in the
rebellion, the number at this time is reduced to less than two
hundred&mdash;and the graduating class of 1863, to twenty-five&mdash;a
number altogether inadequate for the regular army in time of peace, and
much below the present and future exigences of the service, while the
expense of the Academy remains the same. We are assured by the
Superintendent that without any additional expense for building and
material equipment, and with a small advance in the pay of pupils and
assistant teachers, the Cadet Corps could be increased to four hundred.
The Visitors are unanimously of the opinion that the corps should be at
once increased to this number, and should be maintained at this maximum
at all times, by authorizing the President to appoint to any vacancy
which may remain unfilled for three months by reason of nullification,
secession, rebellion, or any other cause. If the appointments to fill
and maintain the Corps at this maximum, can be selected out of the many
American youths, ambitious to serve their country in the army, on the
plan of an open competitive
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page785" id = "page785">785</a></span>
examination in the several States, the Visitors believe that ninety out
of every one hundred thus appointed will go through the whole course
with honor, and the average ability, scholarship, and good conduct of
the whole corps, will equal that now reached by the first ten of each
class.</p>

<p>2. By the original law providing for the appointment of cadets to the
corps of Artillerists and Engineers, and by the act of 1812, by which
the Military Academy was made to consist of the Corps of Engineers, the
candidates for cadets were to be “not under the age of fourteen, nor
above the age of twenty-one years.” By regulations of the Department the
minimum age is fixed at sixteen years, and the Visitors believe that the
interests of the Academy and the military service, will be promoted by
making the legal age for admission between eighteen and twenty-one
years. The four years preceding and including eighteen are peculiarly
the formative period of the body, mind, and character, and should be
devoted to the acquisition of right habits of study and general culture,
as the proper foundation for all special and professional training,
which should not be commenced until the constitution is consolidated,
the taste for a pursuit is distinctly pronounced, and the moral
character is naturally developed under the influences and supervision of
home. The experience of Europe, and particularly of France and England,
has led to the abandonment of juvenile military schools, as nurseries
for officers; and the very common practice of nominating candidates who
exceed the legal age, expresses the convictions of our own people that
military studies now require more maturity of mind than was deemed
necessary in the early history of the Academy. The present want of
uniformity as to age and mental discipline explains in part, the wide
disparity of attainments between members of the same class. With few
brilliant exceptions, confined to cadets of rare aptitude and vigor of
mind, the most solid practical education is obtained by those who come
to West Point when at least eighteen years of age, with at least a good
preparation in English studies, and a taste for mathematical and
military pursuits.</p>

<p>3. The school attainments required by law of candidates for admission
to the Military Academy, are as rudimentary and limited as our language
can express&mdash;far below, we are assured, the requisitions of any
similar school in the world. Prior to 1812, when the Academy was little
more than a school of mathematics, taught by two professors, in the line
of geometrical and algebraical demonstrations, and the practical
exercises were confined to surveying, and the simplest forms of military
construction, the candidates were not
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page786" id = "page786">786</a></span>
subjected to any examination. The act of 1812, provides that “each
candidate previously to his appointment, shall be well versed in
reading, writing, and arithmetic,” and by regulations of the department,
the knowledge of arithmetic is restricted to only a portion of that
science. There were special reasons at the start for thus limiting the
amount of knowledge, when the minimum age of admission was fixed at
fourteen years, and the Academy was properly a juvenile military school,
like all cadet schools in Europe at that time. At that date, science
entered far less than now into the art of war, as applied to the means
and modes of attack as well as of defense. Besides, the opportunities of
even elementary instruction were then far less widely or equally
distributed through all the States than now, when the general government
has set apart over sixty million acres of the best land in aid of
primary schools in all the new States, and nearly every State
legislature has subjected the entire property of their several
communities to taxation for the support of public instruction. Now that
the requirement as to age has been advanced from the fourteenth to the
sixteenth year, and by the voluntary action of parties having the
nomination, or seeking the appointment, to the eighteenth year, we see
no reason why the school attainments corresponding to, and compatible
with that age, should not be also required. The least that should be
demanded of any candidate is that amount of general culture and
attainments, which constitutes a good English education, and which it is
now the aim of the public schools, and their boast, to give without
partiality, to all, poor and rich alike, if the advantages they proffer
are properly improved. And we see no injustice in fixing the standard of
general attainments and culture as high as that now reached by cadets in
good standing at the close of their first year in this Academy,
including even an elementary knowledge of one modern language. If the
French, or Spanish, or German language is to be mastered by American
officers for the sake of the military science and literature which it
embodies, or its uses in conversation, or official duty, called for by
the exigences of our foreign relations, both in peace and war, its
acquisition should be begun as early in life as possible, while the
organs of speech are flexible, and the grammatical and etymological
difficulties of a new language are more readily surmounted. Judging from
the results of the examinations we have witnessed here, and what we know
of the attainments made by students in colleges elsewhere, very few
persons, who begin the study of modern languages, late in their school
life, in the pressure of other studies, ever attain the mastery of even
one, so as to be able to use it as an instrument of written or spoken
communication,
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page787" id = "page787">787</a></span>
or make its treasures of science and literature a familiar
possession.</p>

<p>Whatever may be thought of the disciplinary and practical value of
earlier and longer attention to one or more modern languages, to those,
whose minds will otherwise be almost exclusively subjected to the
peculiar training of the mathematics, there can be no doubt that young
men who have reached the age of eighteen, and desire to profit by the
special studies of a purely military school, should exhibit in their
language, habits, and attainments that intellectual, moral, and
esthetical culture, which the public or private schools of any State
can, and should give to any youth of average ability of that age.</p>

<p>4. Low as the requirements for admission now are, from a defective
and vicious mode, as we believe, of selecting candidates, and making
appointments to the Cadet Corps, the number of candidates nominated and
provisionally appointed, who present themselves at West Point and shrink
from any examination, or who fail to pass even the entrance examination
which is confined to reading a few passages of familiar English prose or
verse, and writing a few sentences from dictation, and performing on the
blackboard a few operations of the most elementary character in
arithmetic,&mdash;or being admitted, are not able to gain or keep a
respectable standing for one year, although the studies of the first
year belong to a general, and not a military education,&mdash;or by a
“special providence,” manage just to escape dismission from
incompetency, and graduate,&mdash;is disgracefully large. The country
abounds in youth, competent to master and profit by the course of
instruction here provided, and ambitious of enjoying these privileges of
education, and opportunities of distinction; and a selection by lot from
the juvenile population of any state, could not result in so few prizes,
and such a dreary waste of blanks as have been realized from the
appointments made, in the necessary absence of all personal knowledge of
the candidates by the appointing power, on the recommendation, or
nomination of one or more persons in each Congressional District, in no
way responsible for the incompetency of the individuals named.</p>

<p>From official tables prepared from the records of the Academy,<a
class = "tag" name = "tag10_14" id = "tag10_14" href =
"#note10_14">14</a> it appears that the proportion of all who graduate,
to all appointed in successive periods of ten years, is as follows:</p>

</table>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page788" id = "page788">788</a></span>
<p>From official returns furnished by the Superintendent, a portion of
which are hereto appended, (B.&nbsp;C.) it appears that out of 4626 who
have been admitted to the Corps of Cadets, (including two hundred new
members,) only 2020 were able to graduate, and of those who failed,
(2398, excluding those who remain,) more than three-fifths broke down in
the first year in studies which in almost every military and scientific
school in Europe are required for admission. Out of the whole number
regularly nominated, recommended, and provisionally appointed from 1841
to 1863, more than twenty per cent. failed to pass the examination, as
to health and constitution, or the slight examination in reading,
writing, and ciphering. And this proportion would be increased by the
number who withdrew in advance from the consciousness of their unfitness
for a position to which ambitious and influential friends had promoted
them. Out of the whole number admitted from 1851 to 1862, more than
one-third failed during their first year. The proportion of graduates to
the whole number admitted is 46 per cent. and of those who failed to
graduate, 54 per cent.</p>

<p>The Visitors are unanimously of opinion that in a matter of such
vital importance as the right organization and command of the armies of
the United States, on which the honor and safety of the whole country
depend, the original appointment to the Cadet Corps which is the
<i>first step</i> in promotion to such command, as well as to all the
special duties which attach to the engineer service, should not be made
in any case except on the principle of finding the best youth for the
place&mdash;having the health, character, vigor of body, maturity and
aptitude of mind, and preparatory knowledge, to profit by the
opportunities of the special military training provided by the
government for this corps, and a decided taste and expressed desire for
a military career. And to this end, the law and regulations should
provide for the rigorous exclusion in advance of all who can not present
testimonials from the teachers under whose instruction they have been
for the two years next previous, that in their opinion they possess the
qualifications above specified, and who do not make a written
declaration of their desire to enter the Corps for the purpose of
qualifying themselves to labor in the military service of the
government, to which they will bear true allegiance against all enemies
foreign and domestic, and over all state and local authority, government
and constitution whatever. To select the best out of any number who may
present their testimonials and written declarations, public examination
should be held of all applicants at such times and places as the
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page789" id = "page789">789</a></span>
law should prescribe, by such persons and under such regulations as the
Department shall be authorized to appoint; and the results of such
examination of each person examined, and in each subject specified by
law, should be returned to the Department, in which return the
applicants should be arranged in the order of merit. From this merit
roll, revised from year to year, all appointments to the Cadet Corps
should be made, and in the order of merit as assigned by the
examiners.</p>

<p>This principle of appointment and promotion by merit which we
advocate, is in full and successful operation in the classification and
advancement of cadets in the Academy itself, and the country will be
satisfied if the same principle can be as fairly and rigorously enforced
on all who aspire to enter, as well as on all promotions in the service
after leaving the institution. The principle itself, of selection by
merit, either in the mode of public examination, or of careful and
searching inquiry by competent and impartial educators, designated for
this purpose by the parties to whom custom and not law had assigned the
grave responsibility of nominating candidates, has been voluntarily
applied in several Congressional Districts. Not a cadet known to have
been thus selected and appointed, has ever broken down from want of
vigor of body or mind, or failed to reach and maintain an honorable
position on the merit roll of the Academy; and to this careful selection
by those who felt the responsibility of the privilege accorded to them,
is the country indebted for its most eminent and useful officers.</p>

<p>To the objection that selection by public competitive examination,
will involve expense, we reply, that any expense which will do away with
the prejudices against the Academy, which the present system of
patronage has done so much directly and indirectly to evoke and foster,
and which will, at the same time, exclude incompetent, and secure the
services of vigorous, talented, well trained officers, for every arm of
the service, will be well incurred. But, in our opinion, there will be
no more expense in selecting and educating a given number of cadets on
this plan, than on the present. The two thousand cadets who were
appointed by patronage and failed to graduate, cost the government,
directly and indirectly each year, a much larger sum than it would have
taken to have excluded them in advance from the institution by
competitive examination, and filling their places by better men; and
their exclusion by substituting better material, would have been an
incalculable gain to the Academy, facilitating its discipline,
increasing the value of its instruction, and giving to the army a larger
number of competent officers.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page790" id = "page790">790</a></span>
<p>The objection, that the mode of making all appointments by open
competitive examination, will deprive the President, and members of
Congress of the opportunity of appointing the sons of meritorious
officers, or poor, and it may be, orphan boys of genius&mdash;is more
plausible than real. That such appointments have been made, to the
manifest advantage of the country, is certain. But we know not a single
instance of such marked success, on the part of a cadet thus appointed,
as to attract investigation, where the same youth would not have secured
the appointment in open competition. But if he had failed, and the place
had been filled by one better qualified, the country would have been no
loser, and he would have suffered no injustice or neglect. We fear, from
an abuse of this amiable motive of rewarding meritorious parents, and
assisting the poor, that in some instances, weak, ignorant, and
incompetent persons are appointed, as though this Academy were a public
charity school, or home for orphans; and not a special school for
military instruction and training, for which the great object, in any
mode of appointment, is to select those who will profit most by its
advantages, and do the country the greatest service after being thus
educated at its expense.</p>

<p>To the objections that, in these examinations, “the most forward boys
will have the best chance, and such boys seldom make the best men,” and
that no amount of book knowledge can give assurance of the great
military genius, “which must be born and not made,” we reply, that these
objections apply just as forcibly to any plan of nomination, and to
every system of instruction. But we believe that those examinations can
be and will be so conducted as to distinguish what is precocious from
what is the healthy development of the faculties, what is solid from
what is showy in attainments, what is vigor, grasp and aptitude of mind
from what is mere memory and quickness, in competing candidates. All of
these candidates must bring the testimonials of their former teachers,
as to their character, ability and attainments, must have reached the
age of eighteen years, and will be called upon to exhibit orally as well
as in writing their knowledge and opinions on subjects which require
judgment, reflection, presence of mind and decision. If a young man of
eighteen and upward shows that he has done well what he had undertaken
to do thus far in life, that he has preserved a sound constitution in
vigorous health, has mastered the studies appropriate to his age, is
honest, diligent, thoughtful, teachable, courageous, courteous, and
ambitious of excellence generally, then the country has every assurance
which can be given that on this basis of character, talents,
attainments, and application, a solid fabric of military
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page791" id = "page791">791</a></span>
education can be reared, and that in the hour of trial he will show not
only courage to dare, but competence to devise, influence and command.
In the responsibilities of such an hour will be found the fruitage of
all his previous promise and preparation.</p>

<p>To the objection&mdash;“that a competitive examination must always
result in the success of the best instructed, wholly irrespective of the
capacity of the competing candidates; and the plan will thus secure for
the country the services of dull mediocrity well instructed, and exclude
genius without opportunities of development,”&mdash;we reply, that this
does occur now under the present system, but need not, and never has
been the result of competitive examination properly conducted. The
examination which we propose to have inaugurated, is not to search
simply or mainly for the results of memory or diligence, but for “vigor
and aptitude of mind” in reference to the special purposes of this
Academy. The examination will be poorly conducted, and will operate here
widely differently than elsewhere, if it does not only exclude in
advance palpable incompetency, and ascertain beyond doubt the possession
by all the successful candidates, of that knowledge which is the basis
of a special military training, but also seek, and give credit in the
result, for the quick eye, the firm set mouth, the vigor and elasticity
of body, the rapid decision, the contempt of danger, the competency to
influence and command&mdash;and all the other marks of the incipient
soldier and officer, as well as the mathematical tastes and qualities of
mind which indicate the successful engineer. Composed as every
Examination Commission might be, of at least one experienced officer of
the United States Army, of one member (past or present,) of the Academic
Board, of one officer of the State Militia, as well as one or more
experts in educational matters, the military qualities of body,
character and mind, will be sought for as well as the mere results of
memory, diligence and good opportunities of instruction, in the
competing candidates.</p>

<p>To the objection, that candidates will make special preparation, and
in the phraseology of the class-room, “cram for the occasion,” we
reply,&mdash;to such preparation and cramming as cover the whole ground
of a good English education, we can see no possible objection; the more
of it, the better. If the preparation is only crude and on the surface,
we are sure that the ploughshare of interrogation requiring precise
answers, oral and written, will very soon expose its superficial and
undigested character.</p>

<p>To the sifting out and selection by open competition, might be added
a period of probation for the successful candidates&mdash;making
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page792" id = "page792">792</a></span>
their first year’s connection with the academy a further test of
capacity, preparation, and aptitude for a military career. No pains and
no expense should be spared to exclude from the academy and the service,
incompetent, indifferent, and unteachable cadets and officers; such men
are “cumberers of the ground,” and no influence and inertia should be
potent enough to resist the inevitable working of the principle of open
competition, applied at frequent intervals, and at every stage of
promotion, in getting rid of such cadets and officers.</p>

<p>The fact that such a public examination is to be held from year <ins
class = "correction" title = "text has ‘to / to’ at line break">to</ins>
year, and that the educational privileges of this Academy, and immediate
and prospective promotion in the army are the prizes which await
success, will, in five years call forth more latent genius in the
obscure corners and poor families of a State, than has ever been sought
out by the lantern of patronage, (which is now seldom carried beyond the
family, or neighborhood, or party of the person having the nomination,)
since the foundation of the Academy. With the network of public and
elementary schools, woven by state legislation over all the
land&mdash;with public schools of a higher grade, and special schools of
science and the arts already established, at short intervals, or which
will be called into existence by the demand for a higher and different
preparation from that now given, it may be safely said, that no genius,
likely to attract the attention of a member of Congress, will exist,
which will not be developed under the same influences by which the “dull
mediocrity” of the rest of the community will be educated. Once set in
the path of instruction and development, real genius will assert its own
claims to attention, and will, on a first or second trial, before any
board of examiners, make its vigor, courage, and persistence felt. The
result will be the same in this institution, as in every really good
Public High School and Free Academy&mdash;all classes as to wealth,
occupation, religious and political affinities will be
represented,&mdash;provided the regulations are judicious, and the
examination practical and impartial.</p>

<p>This is the experience of the competitive principle in France ever
since it was inaugurated by Carnot in the Polytechnic School at Paris,
and Napoleon extended its application to every public special school,
and to promotion in every department of administration, civil as well as
military. And where is there more general administrative ability,
central and local? Where are abler or better trained officers, military
and civil, to be found? Where does “well instructed mediocrity,” no
matter how well backed up by wealth, find less favor, or genius for
organization and command, no matter how poor or unfriended, find such
speedy and sure recognition?</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page793" id = "page793">793</a></span>
<p>The experience of England in the trial of the two principles of
patronage and competitive examination for admission, not only to the
military and naval schools, but to the East India and the Civil service
generally, is instructive, and especially on the points which we are now
considering. Prior to the Crimean war, (which exposed the utter
incompetency of a large number of officers, who had obtained their
military education and promotion by patronage and
purchase,)&mdash;admission to the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich,
was by nomination, and the age fixed by law, was fourteen years.</p>

<p>The Secretary of War was satisfied by personal inquiry in 1855, that
nothing could do so much to narrow and cramp the full development of a
boy’s mind, as his long confinement from so early an age among lads
having the same limited attainments, special studies, and
destination;&mdash;that a majority of those admitted on nomination and
through influential friends, had only the minimum qualifications
specified by law;&mdash;that to most cadets the severer studies were
irksome and imperfectly mastered, on account of immaturity of mind and
imperfect preparation;&mdash;that the certainty of promotion by
influence and purchase, after obtaining the diploma of the Academy, and
not unfrequently without it, took away all stimulus for continued
study;&mdash;that resignations were common, when the profession of arms
ceased to be a pastime, or could be exchanged for something that paid
better&mdash;and the service was incumbered by officers without large
and trained capacity for command, although not deficient in courage and
dash. Under these circumstances the Secretary of War, advanced the
minimum age of candidates from fourteen to eighteen years, removed all
the general studies of the Academy into the preparatory course, and
opened the doors of admission to those only, who could prove their title
to enter by personal merit, in a free competitive examination. The same
principle was applied to appointments and promotion in the new regiments
called for by the exigences of the great war in which England found
herself engaged.</p>

<p>Subjects, time, and places of examination, were officially made known
throughout the kingdom, and commissions to conduct the examinations were
appointed, composed of men of good common sense, military officers, and
eminent practical teachers and educators. The results as stated in a
debate in Parliament, five years later, on extending this principle to
all public schools, and to all appointments and promotions in every
department of the public service, were as follows:&mdash;In the
competitive examinations for admission to the Royal Military Academy,
candidates from all classes
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page794" id = "page794">794</a></span>
of society appeared&mdash;sons of merchants, attorneys, clergymen,
mechanics, and noblemen, and among the successful competitors, every
class was represented. Among the number was the son of a mechanic in the
arsenal at Woolwich, and the son of an earl, who was at the time a
Cabinet Minister&mdash;the graduates of National Schools, and the
students of Eton, and other great Public Schools. The most successful
candidates were between the ages of eighteen and nineteen, as is found
to be the case in competitions for admission to the Polytechnic School
of France. Out of 579 successful candidates for the latter, between 1854
and 1857, 450 were over eighteen years. But the most important result of
the competitive examinations for Woolwich, was the superior mental
ability, the vigorous health, and eagerness for study exhibited by the
new classes, and the small number who have failed on account of
ill-health or incompetency. On this point, Mr. Edward Chadwick, in a
Report before the National Social Science Association, at Cambridge, in
1862, says:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Out of an average three hundred patronage appointed cadets at the
Royal Military Academy at Woolwich, for officers of engineers and the
artillery, during the five years preceding the adoption of the principle
of open competition for admission to the Academy, there were fifty, who
were after long and indulgent trial, and with a due regard to
influential parents and patrons, dismissed for hopeless incapacity for
the service of those scientific corps. During the five subsequent years,
which have been years of the open competition principle, there has not
been one dismissed for incapacity. Moreover, the general standard of
capacity has been advanced. An eminent professor of this university who
has taught as well under the patronage as under the competitive system
at that Academy, declares that the quality of mind of the average of the
cadets, has been improved by the competition, so much so, that he
considers that the present average quality of mind of the cadets
there,&mdash;though the sorts of attainment are different, has been
brought up to the average of the first classmen of this (Cambridge)
university, which of itself is a great gain. Another result, the
opposite to that which was confidently predicted, by the opponents to
the principle, has been that the average physical power or bodily
strength, instead of being diminished, is advanced beyond the average of
their predecessors.”</p>

<p>The opening of the Royal Military School at Woolwich to competition,
on the basis of a more advanced age, and more thorough general
education, has not only drawn in pupils of higher average ability and
attainments, but has enabled the authorities to extend
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page795" id = "page795">795</a></span>
the course of instruction. In this, the only safe way, they solved the
problem which has tortured the ingenuity of the friends of our
Academy&mdash;of crowding new studies acknowledged to be desirable if
not indispensable, into a course already too crowded for cadets so
unequally, and, many of them, so imperfectly prepared for the course as
it is.</p>

<p>Another result of immense importance to the educational interests of
Great Britain has followed the introduction of these open competitive
examinations for appointments to the Military and Naval Schools, to the
East India service, as well as to fill vacancies in the principal
clerkships in the War, Admiralty, Ordnance and Home Departments of the
government:&mdash;a stimulus of the most healthy and powerful kind,
worth more than millions of pecuniary endowment, has been given to all
the great schools of the country, including the universities of England,
Scotland and Ireland. As soon as it was known that candidates, graduates
of Trinity College, Dublin, had succeeded over competitors from Oxford
and Edinburgh in obtaining valuable appointments in the East India
service&mdash;the professors in the latter universities began to look to
their laurels. As soon as it was known to the master of any important
school, that some of his leading pupils might compete in these
examinations, and that his own reputation as a teacher depended in a
measure on the success or failure of these pupils, he had a new motive
to impart the most vigorous and thorough training to his whole
school.</p>

<p>The success of candidates who had never seen the inside of a
government Military School, in open competition for appointments to the
Artillery and Engineer Corps, in the new regiments raised in 1855, over
those who hold the diplomas of the Royal Military Academy, was one of
the reasons which led to a thorough revision of the whole system of
military education.</p>

<p>These results, imperfectly presented here, will, the Visitors
believe, be realized from the changes, which they now suggest, in the
requirements as to age, attainments, capacity and aptitude, and
especially in the mode of ascertaining these qualifications, of
candidates for appointments to the Cadet Corps of the United States
Army.</p>

<p>To the present low requirements, and mode of selecting cadets, do
they attribute the hostility which they know exists, to some extent,
against this Academy, in different parts of the country. The charges of
personal, and political favoritism in making nominations, and the
absence of reasonable search, among all the youth of a district, for the
best qualified in natural endowments and acquired
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page796" id = "page796">796</a></span>
knowledge irrespective of the poverty, or wealth, or occupation, or
family, or party relations of the parents or guardians, we are forced to
believe, in too many instances, to be well founded. To these hasty and
injudicious nominations, do we attribute the bitter disappointments of
so many individuals and families caused by the numerous failures to pass
the almost formal entrance examinations in reading, spelling,
penmanship, and elementary operations of arithmetic, or if admitted, to
maintain a respectable standing in conduct and studies during their
first year’s connection with the institution. To this inequality of
preparation and maturity of mind on entrance, do we attribute the
astonishing disparity of capacity and attainments in the members of the
same class, and the very large proportion of all who are admitted, who
fail to graduate in very high standing as men of science or military
promise.</p>

<p>To this want of preparatory knowledge, maturity of mind, and taste
for mathematical and military studies, do we attribute most of the
difficulties of internal administration, and class-room instruction. So
long as the cadet is a boy, or if full grown in body, a youth with only
boyish tastes, and without scholarly and soldierly aspirations,&mdash;so
long as not a few are in the Academy, not because they sought its
privileges from an inward and irrepressible impulse to a military
career, but for the eclat of a military position to be resigned when
such position involves sacrifices; <i>so long</i> will the admission of
each new class, and especially, the period of encampment be signalized
not only by boyish pranks, but by personal outrages on unoffending
members of the same corps, which we had supposed to belong to the dark
ages of collegiate institutions, when boyish inmates were congregated in
large numbers, away from the restraints of family discipline;&mdash;so
long will the time, skill, and patience of able professors, which should
be devoted to the elucidation of difficult scientific principles and
their applications to military art, be engrossed in supplying the
defects of an elementary education, which should have been obtained by
the cadet as well, or better, at home; so long will the severe
mathematical studies, and their special applications, difficult enough
to task a well disciplined mind even with the preparation provided in a
thorough knowledge of arithmetic, algebra, and geometry,&mdash;be
irksome in the extreme, and be never mastered to any useful purpose to
the army of the United States, by more than one half of the graduates of
the Academy;&mdash;so long will the country be disappointed in the
subsequent career of many graduates, for whose military instruction and
training all these appropriate and costly preparations have been
made.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page797" id = "page797">797</a></span>
<p>In view of these and other considerations the Board of Visitors
unanimously recommend that the law and regulations relating to the
military academy be so modified as to provide as follows:</p>

<p>I. The Cadet Corps of the army of the United States shall consist of
four hundred members, to which each state and territory shall be
entitled to a number equal to its representation in the Congress of the
United States, and the remainder shall be designated by the President
from the country at large, including the District of Columbia; and he
shall also fill, in the same way, any vacancy which for any cause may
remain unfilled, for three months after the annual examination in each
year.</p>

<p>II. No person shall be appointed to the cadet corps until he has been
found qualified in the particulars designated by law, after a public
examination conducted in such places, at such times, and in such manner
as Congress shall prescribe; from which examination no person resident
of that portion of the country for which the same is held, shall be
excluded, who shall present credentials from the teacher or teachers
whom he had last attended, that he is over seventeen, and under
twenty-one years of age, of unblemished moral character, and personal
habits, of good physical strength and constitution, and has given
evidence of aptitude and vigor of mind for the studies and duties of a
military career. The examiners shall make return under oath to the
Secretary of War, of the persons so presenting themselves, examined, and
found qualified, arranged in the order of merit, specifying the
residence and school or schools which they have attended in the two
years previous, and the degree of merit exhibited in each subject of the
examination. And all appointments to fill vacancies for any state or
territory, or for the country at large, shall be made from these
returns, and in the order of merit as assigned by the examiners, until
the same shall be revised by new regulations of the Department.</p>

<p>III. No person shall be returned to the Secretary of War as a
suitable candidate for admission to the Cadet Corps, unless he</p>

<p>1. Shall be <i>over</i> seventeen, and under twenty-one years of
age.</p>

<p>2. Shall possess an unblemished moral character and correct personal
habits.</p>

<p>3. Shall be in good health, and in no way incapacitated by want of
vigor and elasticity of physical constitution for military service.</p>

<p>4. Shall possess vigor and aptitude of mind for the studies of the
Military Academy, and shall give evidence, oral and written, of a good
English education, which, in view of the wide spread facilities of
instruction in public and private schools, might very properly
embrace</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page798" id = "page798">798</a></span>
<p>(<i>a.</i>) The correct use of the English language, in speaking,
reading, and writing the same.</p>

<p>(<i>b.</i>) Penmanship, book-keeping, and elementary drawing.</p>

<p>(<i>c.</i>) The ability to perform with facility and accuracy the
various operations of arithmetic.</p>

<p>(<i>d.</i>) The elementary principles of algebra and geometry.</p>

<p>(<i>e.</i>) A thorough knowledge of American geography and history,
and the leading features of the Constitution of the United States, and
of the State of his residence.</p>

<p>(<i>f.</i>) Or so much of the subjects above specified as shall be
deemed indispensable to the immediate and profitable attention of the
Cadets on their admission to the special studies and occupations of a
military school.</p>

<p>5. Shall make a written declaration of his desire to obtain admission
to the Cadet Corps for the purpose of qualifying himself for the
military service of the United States, which service he assumes from the
date of his appointment as cadet, to continue in the same for a period
of at least sixteen years&mdash;bearing true faith and allegiance to the
Constitution and government of the United States, against all enemies,
foreign and domestic, and paramount to all obligations to any State
government, authority, or constitution.</p>

<p>The Totals in the column of Cadets admitted, graduated, and failed to

<h4>OPINIONS OF COL. THAYER AND OTHERS.</h4>

<p class = "heading"><i>On the recommendations of the Board of Visitors
as to the conditions of admission to the United States Military Academy
at West Point.</i></p>


<p><span class = "firstword">Extract</span> from a letter of <span class
= "smallcaps">Col. Sylvanus Thayer</span>, Superintendent of the United
States Military Academy, from 1816 to 1831.</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>“The Extracts from the Report of the Visitors at West Point, for
1863, I have read with the highest satisfaction, not to say admiration.
The subject of the admission of Cadets, their number, age, attainments,
and mode of appointment, is discussed in the most complete and able
manner, <i>ne laissant rien a desirer</i>, as far as I can see.
I&nbsp;am naturally the more pleased from finding my own views so
perfectly reflected in many important particulars. The only difference I
notice is the small addition to my standard of attainment for admission.
I&nbsp;not only agree to that, but would raise the standard as high as
Congress would be willing to adopt. The higher the standard, the more
perfect will be the test of capacity. The subject, as you may well
suppose, is not a new one with me. More than forty years ago I made my
first effort to have the mode of appointment by nomination, done away
with, and admission by open competition adopted. My last effort before
the late one, was made in 1858, while I was in command of the Corps of
Engineers, during the absence of Gen. Totten. At the same time,
I&nbsp;recommended a higher standard of attainment, a Board of
Improvement, and some of the other changes comprised in my
“Propositions,” but with little expectation, however, that my solitary
voice would be heeded. After long despairing, I&nbsp;am now encouraged
and cheered. Admission by competitive examination, open to all, may not
be attained as soon as we wish, but come it must at no distant day. Let
every future Board of Visitors recall the attention of the Government to
your excellent Report; no new arguments are needed, and let all the
publications devoted to the cause of education, agitate the question
<ins class = "correction"
title = "close quote missing">unceasingly.”</ins></p>
</div>

<p>We have been favored with the perusal of the <ins class =
"correction" title = "close quote missing">“Propositions,”</ins>
referred to in Col. Thayer’s letter, and submitted by him to the
Secretary of War, in 1863, with “Suggestions for the Improvement of the
United States Military Academy.” So far as the Visitors go, their views,
and those of Col. Thayer, are almost identical, but Col. Thayer’s
communication to the Secretary includes many other suggestions relating
to the instruction, discipline, and administration of the institution,
which we hope will be adopted by the Secretary, and embodied in the
Regulations.</p>

<p>In addition to the modifications suggested by Col. Thayer, we should
like to see the theoretical course at West Point reduced to two years;
and Special Courses, or Schools of Application and Practice
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page806" id = "page806">806</a></span>
established for the Engineer, Artillery, Cavalry, and Infantry service,
open only to those who should show natural aptitude, and the proper
amount of acquired knowledge, whether graduates of the scientific course
of West Point, or any State scientific or classical school, in a
competitive examination. In each of these courses or schools, there
should be a graduation, and promotion, in the particular service,
according to merit. Our whole system of military instruction should
terminate in a <span class = "smallroman">STAFF SCHOOL</span>, open only
to those who, in addition to the knowledge required for graduation in at
least two of the above special courses, should have had at least three
years actual experience in service. While members of the Staff School,
these candidates for the Staff Corps, should, if called for by the State
authorities, assist without compensation, in conducting Military
Encampments of the Officers of the State Militia, like those held every
year in Switzerland, and corresponding to what is known in this country
to Teacher’s Institutes. The graduates of the Staff School, should
constitute the Staff Corps, from which all vacancies in the higher
offices of the Regular Army should be filled, and all appointments to
new regiments be made.</p>


<p><span class = "smallcaps">Extract</span> from a letter of <span class

<div class = "in-one">
<p>I have read with the utmost care, the Extract from the Report of the
Board of Examiners of the Military Academy at West Point, for the year
1863, and most heartily concur in the views therein set forth, and
especially in that portion of it, which recommends a competitive
examination of candidates for admission. In all its relations it is
right. In fact it stands out prominently as the only proper mode of
admittance.</p>

<p>My intimate acquaintance with the Academy, having attended the
examination in 1846, by invitation, and again in 1847, as Secretary of
the Board of Visitors for that year, enables me to speak with reasonable
authority. These visits afforded me opportunities, which I improved to
the utmost, and most minutely, to become intimately well informed of the
effect of the prevailing method of selection, and of its practical
results upon character and scholarship after admission, as well as to
know, with what degree of fidelity, the institution was answering the
intent of its founding, and the just expectation of the country; and I
was then satisfied, and subsequent observation has confirmed me in my
opinion, that whatever of deficiency prevailed, was traceable to the
method of admission. Faithful teachers and faithful teaching will
achieve great results, but they can not make good, incompetent natural
endowments, nor infuse vigor and life into sluggish natures.
I&nbsp;sincerely hope that the Government will feel the force of your
views, and comply with your most commendable recommendations.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Extract</span> from letter of Prof. Monroe,
St. John’s College, Fordham, N.Y.</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>I rejoice that some one has taken hold of this subject at last. It
needs only to be understood to be adopted; for I can not see from what
quarter any opposition to it can arise. You rightly observe that “all
the educational institutions of the several States” are interested in
this mode of appointment. Great Britain, France, and many of the
Continental States admit to their military schools the most competent
young men who present themselves, and the method is found to be as
economical as it is equitable. Long years of <i>winnowing</i> is saved
to the Government; for the subjects who present themselves are, of
course, the most capable. For several years I was a witness of the
beneficial effects produced on youth in France by the stimulation of
their energies in order to undergo an examination for admission into the
military or naval schools. Our present mode of appointment appears to be
an anomaly; for while monarchies find it expedient to adopt a less
exclusive mode of sustaining their military organizations, we still
cling to one founded on patronage and prerogative. Many of our young men
in different colleges and educational institutions have a taste and
vocation to the military profession, and have an equal right to compete
for a place in the only fields where such a taste can be
gratified&mdash;viz., in the army and navy. These careers should then be
open to them. There is danger and want of policy in suppressing the
legitimate aspirations of young men in a nation which is, say what we
can, passionately fond of military glory.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Extract</span> from the Report of the Board
of Visitors of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point for 1864.</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>The main features of the Report of the Visitors for 1863 we most
cordially approve, especially its recommendations of competitive
examination, and raising the age and qualifications of candidates for
admission. The only student who obtained his appointment through
competitive examination (introduced into his district by the member of
Congress upon whose recommendation he was appointed from the common

</div>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page808" id = "page808">808</a></span>
<p>The beneficial effect on schools, as regards both pupils and
teachers, of throwing open appointments in civil, as well as in military
and naval service, to competition, and giving them to the most
meritorious candidates, on examination, is thus commented on in the
Report of the Queen’s Commissioners on the Endowed Schools of
Ireland:</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>This measure has received the unanimous approval of our body, who
regard it as an effectual method of promoting intermediate education.
The experience already obtained respecting the operation of public and
competitive examinations, so far as they have hitherto been tried,
leaves no doubt on our minds that the extension of this system would,
under judicious management, produce very beneficial effects, both in
raising the standard of instruction, and in stimulating the efforts of
masters and of pupils. The educational tests adapted for examinations
for the public service would be, in our opinion, of all others the most
general in their character, and therefore, those best calculated to
direct the efforts of teachers to that course of mental discipline and
moral training, the attainment of which constitutes, in our opinion, the
chief object of a liberal education. The experience of the civil service
commission has shown the shortcomings of all classes in the most general
and most elementary branches of a literary and scientific education.</p>

<p>These views are strongly corroborated by the testimony, appended to
the Report, of prominent teachers and educators consulted on the
subject:</p>

<p>Prof. Bullen, in the Queen’s College, Cork, remarks:&mdash;“No
movement ever made will so materially advance education in this country
as the throwing open public situations to meritorious candidates. It has
given already a great impulse to schools and will give greater. The
consequence of throwing the civil service open to the public is already
beginning to tell&mdash;although only in operation a few months, it has
told in a most satisfactory manner in this city; and, from what I can
see, it will have the happiest results on education generally.”</p>

<p>Prof. King, Head Master of a Grammar School at Ennis,
writes:&mdash;“These examinations have already caused improvements in my
own school by inducing me to give instruction in branches which I had
never taught before.”</p>

<p>The Dean of Elphin, the Archdeacon of Waterford and the Bishop of
Doun, advocate the measure on the ground of its tendency to produce
competition between schools, and to stimulate private enterprise. The
Bishop of Cashel “thought that this competition would be more valuable
than the endowment of schools giving education gratuitously.”</p>

<p>In confirmation of the above views, and as an illustration of the
benefits likely to accrue both to the cause of education and to the
public service from the extension of the system of competitive
examinations, we may add that, at the late competitive examination for
certificates of merit held by the Royal Dublin Society Mr. Samuel
Chapman, who was educated solely by the Incorporated Society, as a
foundation boy, obtained the first place and a prize of £5.&nbsp;In
consequence of this success the Bank of Ireland immediately appointed
him to a clerkship. Mr. Chapman was originally elected to the Pococke
Institution, from a parish school, by a competitive examination; and on
his leaving the Santry school Prof. Galbraith appointed him his
assistant in Trinity College, in consequence of the skill in drawing
which he exhibited, and his knowledge of mathematics, as proved by his
final examination.</p>

<span class = "submini">DEBATE IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE, MAY 18TH,
1864.</span></h4>

<p><span class = "firstword">The</span> Bill making appropriation for
the Military Academy being under consideration, Senator Anthony, of R.
Island, remarked on the following amendment:</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p><i>And be it further enacted</i>, That hereafter, in all appointments
of cadets to the Military Academy at West Point, the selections for such
appointments in the several districts shall be made from the candidates
according to their respective merits and qualifications, to be
determined under such rules and regulations as the Secretary of War
shall from time to time prescribe.</p>
</div>

<p>This, Mr. President, is substantially the proposition which I offered
at the last session; and although I was not so fortunate as to obtain
for it the assent of the Senate, mainly from an apprehension of
practical difficulties in carrying out what is admitted to be a
desirable reform if it could be effected, yet the general expression of
Senators was so much in favor of the principle, and I have been so much
strengthened in my views on the subject by subsequent reflection and
examination, that I am emboldened to renew it.</p>

<p>I differ entirely from those who are fond of disparaging the Military
Academy. It has been of incalculable service to the country; it is the
origin and the constant supply of that military science without which
mere courage would be constantly foiled, and battles would be but Indian
fights on a large scale. Not to speak of the Mexican war, throughout the
whole of which West Point shone with conspicuous luster, it is safe to
leave the vindication of the Academy to the gallant and able men who
have illustrated the annals of the war that is now raging. Nor have its
indirect advantages been less marked than its direct. It has kept alive
a military spirit, and kept up a good standard of military instruction
in the volunteer militia. It furnished, from its graduates who have
retired from the Army, scores of men who rushed to the head of our new
levies, who organized and instructed them, inspired them with
confidence, and led them over many a bloody field to many a glorious
victory. Large numbers of our best volunteer officers owe their
instruction indirectly to West Point.</p>

<p>To say that no course of military instruction can make a pupil a
military genius, can create in him that rare quality that takes in at a
glance, almost by intuition, the relative strength of great masses
opposed to each other, and that power of combination which can bring an
inferior force always in greater number upon the severed portions of a
superior force, is very true. To discard military education on that
account would be like shutting up the schools and colleges because they
can not turn out Miltons and Burkes and Websters. Education does not
create, it develops and enlarges and inspires and elevates. It will make
the perfect flower, the majestic tree, from the little seed; but it must
have the seed. And what I desire is that the Academy at West Point
should have the best seed; that its great resources, its careful
culture, its scientific appliances, should not be wasted on second-rate
material. The Academy has never had a fair chance; the country has not
had a fair chance; the boys have
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page810" id = "page810">810</a></span>
not had a fair chance. This is what I want them all to have, and
especially the country. I&nbsp;desire that the Academy shall begin, as
it goes on, upon the competitive principle. As all its standing, all its
honors, are won by competition, so should the original right to compete
for them be won. I&nbsp;would give all the youth of the country a fair
chance; and, more desirable than that, I&nbsp;would give the country a
fair chance for all its youth. I&nbsp;would have the Academy filled up
by those young men who, upon examination by competent judges, should be
found most likely to render the best service to the country; to make the
best officers; whose qualifications, physical, intellectual, and moral,
whose tastes and habits, should seem to best fit them for military
life.</p>

-->

<p>But, it is objected, no such examination would be infallible. Of
course it would not be. No human judgment is infallible. Our
deliberations are not infallible; but therefore shall we not deliberate?
The decisions of the Supreme Court are not infallible; therefore shall
we abolish the court?</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">A Senator.</span> The Senator from New
Hampshire would say yes.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Mr. Anthony.</span> I know the Senator from
New Hampshire [Mr. <span class = "smallcaps">Hale</span>] would say
“Yes.” He would abolish both the Academy and the Court, and I can well
suppose that the policy which would abolish the one might abolish the
other. But although such an examination would not be infallible, it
would, if properly organized and properly conducted, accomplish much
toward the reform which all admit to be desirable, if it be practicable.
It can not be doubted that the young men who would come out best from
such a trial would, as a body, be superior to those who are selected
upon mere personal preferences, and these preferences generally not for
themselves, but for their parents; not for their own qualifications, but
as a recognition of the political services of their fathers.</p>

<p>But, again, it was objected when I made this proposition a year ago
that it was not equal; because, in giving to any given place of
examination, some young men would have further to travel than others! If
this objection had not been gravely made by men for whom I have the
highest respect I should be tempted to call it puerile. A&nbsp;boy asks
the privilege of going a hundred miles to the place of examination, and
is told that he can not have it because another boy will have to go two
hundred miles, and another but fifty, and it is not equal! The fact that
either of them would go five hundred miles on foot for the opportunity
of competition is not taken into the account. On the same principle our
elections are not equal, for one man must travel further than another to
reach the polls. For a boy who can not obtain the means to travel from
his home to the place of examination&mdash;and there will be very few
such of those who would be likely to pass high in the
examination&mdash;the plan proposed would be no worse, certainly, than
the present system; for those who have the means the difference in
travel is too small an item to enter into the account.</p>

<p>No plan can be made perfectly equal. Shall we therefore refuse to
make a large advance toward equality? Certainly the system which invites
a competition from all who are in a condition to avail themselves of it
is more equal than that which excludes all competition. But although
equality in the advantages of the Academy is very desirable, and
although the amendment proposed would be a long step in that direction,
it is not for that reason that I urge it. It is not to give all the
young men an equal chance for the Academy, it is to give the Academy a
chance for the best young men; and although even under this system the
best young men will often fail of success, it can not be doubted that
many more of them will enter the service than under the present
system.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page811" id = "page811">811</a></span>
<p>Nor will the advantages of this competition be confined to those who
reach the prize for which so many will struggle. An incalculable
although an incidental benefit will accrue to the thousands whose
youthful hearts will be stirred by an honorable ambition, and who will
cultivate their minds by liberal studies and develop their physical
power by manly exercises in the struggle upon which the humblest may
enter, and in which the proudest can obtain only what he fairly earns.
Under the present system the Academy wastes full half its strength upon
boys who never ought to be admitted, and whose natural incapacity
derives but little benefit from the partial training that they receive
there. Under the system proposed, the Academy would exert its influence
upon thousands of the brightest and most aspiring boys all over the
country, stimulating them to the pursuit of such studies and to the
formation of such habits as, if they fail to carry them to West Point,
will help to conduct them to usefulness and honor in whatever path of
life they may choose.</p>

<p>But, again, we are met with the objection that this proposition is
impracticable, that it looks very well on paper, but that it can not be
carried into effect. Let us see. It is quite safe to conclude that what
has been done can be done, and that what wise and judicious people do,
and persist in doing after experiment, is proper to be done. What is the
most warlike nation of Europe? What nation of Europe has carried
military science to the highest degree? What nation of Europe has the
greatest genius for organization? You will say the French. Let us see
what is their <ins class = "correction"
title = "text has ‘sytem’">system</ins>. I&nbsp;read from the report of the Commission
appointed by Congress in 1860 to visit the Military Academy at West
Point, and report upon the system of instruction; a commission of which
you, Mr. President, [Mr. <span class = "smallcaps">Foot</span>,] were a
member:</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>Among the European systems of military education that of France is
preëminent. The stimulating principle of competition extends throughout
the whole system; it exists in the appointment of the student, in his
progress through the preliminary schools, in his transfer to the higher
schools, in his promotion to the Army, and in his advancement in his
subsequent career. The distinguishing features of the French system are
thus described by the British commissioners.</p>

<p>“1. The proportion, founded apparently upon principle, which officers
educated in military schools are made to bear to those promoted for
service from the ranks. 2.&nbsp;The mature age at which military
education begins. 3.&nbsp;The system of thorough competition on which it
is founded. 4.&nbsp;The extensive State assistance afforded to
successful candidates for entrance into military schools whenever their
circumstances require it. <span class = "halfspace">******</span></p>

<p>Admission to the military schools of France can only be gained
through a public competitive examination by those who have received the
degree of bachelor of science from the lycées or public schools, and
from the orphan school of La Flèche.</p>

<p>A powerful influence has thus been exercised upon the character of
education in France. The importance of certain studies has been
gradually reduced, while those of a scientific character, entering more
directly into the pursuits of life, have been constantly elevated.</p>

<p>The two great elementary military schools are the School of St. Cyr
and the Polytechnic School. These, as well as the other military
schools, are under the charge of the Minister of War, with whom the
authorities of the schools are in direct communication. Commissions in
the infantry, cavalry, and marines can only be obtained by service in
the ranks of the army, or by passing successfully through the School of
St. Cyr, admission to which is gained by the competitive examination
already referred to.”</p>
</div>

<p>Again, the Commission say, speaking of the School of St. Cyr:</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>The admission is by competitive examination, open to all youths,
French by birth or by naturalization, who, on the 1st of January
preceding their candidature,
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page812" id = "page812">812</a></span>
were not less than sixteen and not more than twenty years old. To this
examination are also admitted soldiers in the ranks between twenty and
twenty-five years, who, at the date of its commencement, have been
actually in service in their regiments for two years.</p>

<p>A board of examiners passes through France once every year, and
examines all who present themselves having the prescribed
qualifications.</p>

<p>A list of such candidates as are found eligible for admission to St.
Cyr is submitted to the Minister of War. The number of vacancies has
already been determined, and the candidates admitted are taken in the
order of merit.</p>

<p>Twenty-seven, or sometimes a greater number, are annually, at the
close of their second year of study, placed in competition with
twenty-five candidates from the second lieutenants belonging to the
army, if so many are forthcoming, for admission to the Staff School of
Paris. This advantage is one object which serves as a stimulus to
exertion, the permission being given according to rank in the
classification by order of merit.</p>
</div>

<p>In regard to the Polytechnic School, the Commission say:</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>Admission to the School is, and has been since its first commencement
in 1794, obtained by competition in a general examination, held yearly,
and open to all. Every French youth between the ages of sixteen and
twenty (or&nbsp;if in the army up to the age of twenty-five) may offer
himself as a candidate.</p>
</div>

<p>This is the system which was organized by Carnot and adopted and
extended by Napoleon. Under this system the French army has attained its
perfection of organization, its high discipline, its science, its dash,
and its efficiency.</p>

<p>But not the French alone have adopted the competitive system. In
England, all whose traditions are aristocratical, where promotion in the
army has so long been made by patronage and by purchase, the sturdy
common sense of the nation has pushed away the obstructions that have
blocked up the avenues to the army, and have opened them to merit, come
from what quarter it may. In the commencement of the Crimean war, the
English people were shocked at the evident inferiority of their army to
the French. Their officers did not know how to take care of their men,
or how to fight them. And although in the end British pluck and British
persistence vindicated themselves as they always have and always will,
it was not till thousands of lives had been sacrificed that might have
been saved under a better system. No French officer would have permitted
that memorable charge at Balaklava, which was as remarkable for the
stupidity that ordered it as for the valor that executed it, and which
has been sung in verses nearly as bad as the generalship which they
celebrate. After the war, the English Government, with the practical
good sense which usually distinguishes it, came, without difficulty, to
the conclusion that merit was better than family in officering the army,
and that it was more desirable to put its epaulets upon the shoulder of
those who could take care of the men and lead them properly than upon
those who could trace their descent to the Conqueror, or whose uncles
could return members of Parliament. Accordingly, the Royal Military
Academy, which had been filled, as ours is, by patronage, was thrown
open to public competition. On this subject I quote from the very
interesting and valuable report of the Visitors of the Military Academy
in 1863:</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>The same principle was applied to appointments and promotion in the
new regiments called for by the exigencies of the great war in which
England found herself engaged.</p>

<p>Subjects, time, and place of examination were officially made known
throughout the kingdom, and commissions to conduct the examinations were
appointed, composed of men of good common sense, military officers, and
eminent practical teachers and educators. The results, as stated in a
debate in Parliament five years later, on extending this principle to
all public schools, and all appointments
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page813" id = "page813">813</a></span>
and promotions in every department of the public service, were as
follows: in the competitive examinations for admission to the Royal
Military Academy candidates from all classes of society
appeared&mdash;sons of merchants, attorneys, clergymen, mechanics, and
noblemen, and among the successful competitors every class was
represented. Among the number was the son of a mechanic in the arsenal
at Woolwich, and the son of an earl who was at that time a cabinet
minister&mdash;the graduates of national schools, and the students of
Eton, and other great public schools.</p>

<p>On this point Mr. Edward Chadwick, in a report before the National
Social Science Association, at Cambridge in 1862, says:</p>

<p>“Out of an average three hundred patronage-appointed cadets at the
Royal Military Academy at Woolwich, for officers of engineers and the
artillery, during the five years preceding the adoption of the principle
of open competition for admission to the Academy, there were fifty who
were, after long and indulgent trial and with a due regard to
influential parents and patrons, dismissed for hopeless incapacity for
the service of those scientific corps. During the five subsequent years,
which have been years of the open-competition principle, there has not
been one dismissed for incapacity. Moreover, the general standard of
capacity has been advanced. An eminent professor of this university, who
has taught as well under the patronage as under the competitive system
at that Academy, declares that the quality of mind of the average of the
cadets has been improved by the competition, so much so that he
considers that the present average quality of the mind of cadets there,
though the sorts of attainment are different, has been brought up to the
average of the first-class men of this (Cambridge) university, which of
itself is a great gain. Another result, the opposite to that which was
confidently predicted by the opponents to the principle, has been that
the average physical power or bodily strength, instead of being
diminished, is advanced beyond the average of their predecessors.”</p>
</div>

<p>I read this also from the same report:</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>Another result of immense importance to the educational interests of
Great Britain has followed the introduction of these open competitive
examinations for appointments to the military and naval schools, to the
East India service, as well as to fill vacancies in the principal
clerkships in the war, admiralty, ordnance, and home departments of the
Government. A&nbsp;stimulus of the most healthy and powerful kind, worth
more than millions of pecuniary endowment, has been given to all the
great schools of the country, including the universities of England,
Scotland, and Ireland. As soon as it was known that candidates,
graduates of Trinity College, Dublin, had succeeded over competitors
from Oxford and Edinburg in obtaining valuable appointments in the East
India service, the professors in the latter universities began to look
to their laurels. As soon as it was known to the master of any important
school that some of his leading pupils might compete in these
examinations, and that his own reputation as a teacher depended in a
measure on the success or failure of these pupils, he had a new motive
to impart the most vigorous and thorough training.</p>
</div>

<p>Such has been the result in France and in England. We are not without
examples at home. The competitive system has been tried in repeated
instances here in the appointments both to the Military and the Naval
Academy. Several Representatives in Congress, with a conscientious sense
of the responsibility resting upon them, have given their patronage to
the result of general competition, among them the gentleman who so ably
represented, in the last Congress, the district in which I live. The
results have been most satisfactory. Here, again, I&nbsp;will quote from
the report of the Board of Visitors for 1863:</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>The principle itself, of selection by merit, either in the mode of
public examination or of careful and searching inquiry by competent and
impartial educators designated for this purpose by the parties to whom
custom, and not law, had assigned the grave responsibility of nominating
candidates, has been voluntarily applied in several Congressional
districts. Not a cadet known to have been thus selected and appointed
has ever broken down from want of vigor of body or mind, or failed to
reach and maintain an honorable position on the merit-roll
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page814" id = "page814">814</a></span>
of the Academy; and to this careful selection by those who felt the
responsibility of the privilege accorded to them is the country indebted
for its most eminent and useful officers.</p>
</div>

<p>The same report makes some observations on another point:</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>To the objection that selection by public competitive examination
will involve expense, we reply that any expense which will do away with
the prejudices against the Academy, which the present system of
patronage has done so much directly and indirectly to evoke and foster,
and which will, at the same time, exclude incompetent and secure the
services of vigorous, talented, well-trained officers for every arm of
the service, will be well incurred. But in our opinion there will be no
more expense in selecting and educating a given number of cadets on this
plan than on the present. The two thousand cadets who were appointed by
patronage and failed to graduate, cost the Government, directly and
indirectly, each year a much larger sum than it would have taken to have
excluded them in advance from the institution by competitive examination
and filling their places by better men; and their exclusion by
substituting better material would have been an incalculable gain to the
Academy, facilitating its discipline, increasing the value of its
instruction, and giving to the Army a larger number of competent
officers.</p>
</div>

<p>Even under the despotic government of Austria the competitive system
has been adopted for the higher places, and it has been adopted by
Prussia and Italy. In Austria every subject can claim admission into the
military schools on payment of the cost of his instruction; and all the
appointments to the staff are on the competitive system. On this subject
I read from the work upon Military Education and Schools, by Hon. Henry
Barnard, who stands in the very front rank of the great educators, and
who gives, to the competitive system the weight of a name which alone
should incline us strongly in its favor:</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>The yearly examinations, the manner in which the marks of the monthly
examinations tell on the final one, and the careful classification of
the pupils in the order of merit, reminded us of the system of the
Polytechnic more than any other school we have seen. <span class =
"halfspace">****</span></p>

<p>The arrangements for the general staff-school require more
remark.</p>

<p>In our report upon Austrian schools we have specially noticed this
school as remarkable for its thorough and open competitive character
from first to last, and its very sensible plan of study. Admission to it
is by competition, open to officers of all arms. The pupils are not
unduly overburdened with work; perhaps there is even room for one or two
more subjects of importance; but what is done seems to be done
thoroughly. The officers are carefully ranked on leaving the school,
according as the abilities they have displayed may be considered a
criterion of their fitness for employment on the general staff; and in
this order they enter the staff corps. The consequence is that every
officer knows distinctly, from the time that he first competes for
admission until his final examination on leaving, that the order in
which he will enter the staff depends entirely on his own exertions and
success at the school. It seemed to us that this open competition
produced a spirit of confidence and energy in the students as great, if
not greater, than any we met with elsewhere.</p>
</div>

<p>I quote from the same work in regard to the military education in
Sardinia:</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>Admission into the artillery and engineer school may be considered
the reward of the most distinguished pupils of the <i>Accademia
Militare</i>, who, after spending their last year in that institution in
the study of the higher mathematics, chemistry, and architectural
drawing, are transferred for the completion of their education to the
school of the artillery and engineers.</p>

<p>The staff-school, the formation of which dates from 1850, is chiefly
frequented by officers of the infantry and cavalry, who must be below
the age of twenty-eight years upon their entrance. It is carried on upon
the competitive final examination, the ablest entering the staff corps
in that order.</p>
</div>

<p>In the same work Mr. Barnard characterizes the Staff-School at
Vienna:</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>The most striking features in the system of this school, both at the
entrance
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page815" id = "page815">815</a></span>
and throughout the course, are, that it is distinctly competitive, that
it admits very young officers, and that while the work is considerable,
the subjects for study are not numerous. In these three points it
differs considerably from the Prussian staff-school, in which the
students are generally older, and the principle of competition is not so
fully carried out. In the Austrian school the students are placed, on
entering, in the order which their entrance examination has just fixed.
They are examined once a month during their stay. On leaving the school
their respective places are again determined, and they have a claim for
appointments in the staff corps in the exact order in which they were
placed on leaving the school. In Belgium, the competitive system is
fully adopted.</p>
</div>

<p>The following testimony is from a report on the progress of the
principle of competitive examination for admission into the public
service, read before Section F. Economic Science and Statistics of the
British Association for the Advancement of Science, at Leeds, September
27, 1858, by Edward Chadwick:</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>Mr. Canon Mosely attests that the “qualifications of the whole” body
of competitive candidates appeared to rise above the general “level of
the education of the country.” It is stated in evidence before the
commissioners for inquiring into the means of improving the sanitary
condition of the army, that this was most decidedly so of the whole body
of competing candidates for medical appointments in the East India
service. Mr. Canon Mosely concludes his report on the last year’s
experience in the following terms: “With reference to the general scope
and tendency of competitive examinations, I&nbsp;may perhaps be
permitted the observation, that the consciousness which success in such
examinations brings with it in early life of a power to act resolutely
on a determinate plan, and to achieve a difficult success, contributes
more than the consciousness of talent to the formation of a manly and
honorable character, and to success on whatever career a man may
enter.”</p>
</div>

<p>The report of the last Board of Visitors at West Point, from which I
have read, I&nbsp;believe has not yet been printed by Congress;
I&nbsp;have read from a pamphlet copy of it printed in the Journal of
Education. The Board was composed, as it usually is, of men of high
character and ability. After a full and laborious examination of the
whole subject, they unanimously and earnestly recommend the adoption of
the competitive system.</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>If the appointments to fill and maintain the corps at this maximum
[four hundred] can be selected out of the many American youths ambitious
to serve their country in the Army, on the plan of an open competitive
examination in the several States, the Visitors believe that ninety out
of every one hundred thus appointed will go through the whole course
with honor, and the average ability, scholarship, and good conduct of
the whole corps will equal that now reached by the first ten of each
class.</p>
</div>

<p>With such experience of other nations, with such examples at home,
I&nbsp;submit that we may safely in this republican country give our
young men the privileges that are conceded in imperial France and in
aristocratic England; that we may safely place competition against
patronage, and give to modest merit a chance with pretentious
imbecility. I&nbsp;would go somewhat further in the competitive system.
I&nbsp;would not have the Army or the Navy officered exclusively by the
graduates of the national Academies. If any young man, at his own
expense, and by his own study and aptitude for the profession, has
fitted himself for a command in either, let the competition be open to
him equally with those who have been instructed at the public expense,
and let the epaulets rest on the shoulders that are most worthy to wear
them. But I do not propose to follow the subject to this extent at
present. I&nbsp;shall be abundantly content if the Senate will adopt the
competitive system, which has worked so well in other countries and so
well here as far as it has been tried, in the Military Academy.</p>

AT FORTRESS MONROE</a></h3>

<p class = "smallhead">HISTORICAL NOTICE.</p>

<p><span class = "firstword">The</span> Artillery School of the United
States Army at Fortress Monroe, was organized and opened April 1, 1868,
under a code of regulations and programme of instruction drawn up by
Col. William F. Barry (who was placed in command from the start), and
approved by the General of the Army. After two years of experience the
code and programme were revised, and the present system established. The
class of 1868 and of 1869, consisted, each, of twenty lieutenants of
artillery, and of the whole number, thirty-eight were sent back to their
regiments after having passed a satisfactory examination. To this number
at the close of the school year (April) 1871, sixteen more out of the
class of twenty were found qualified to return to their respective
regiments; twenty more are now in the progress of instruction,
constituting together one-half of all the officers of that grade
belonging to the artillery.</p>


<p class = "smallhead">COURSE OF INSTRUCTION.<a class = "tag" name =
"tag10_16" id = "tag10_16" href = "#note10_16">16</a></p>

<p>The course of theoretical instruction embraces the subjects of
mathematics, ordnance, and gunnery, military engineering and surveying,
military history, and military, constitutional, and international law.
The method of pursuing these studies is very similar to that pursued at
the Military Academy at West Point, viz., by recitations, questions, and
demonstrations at the blackboard. In military history each officer is
required, in addition to his regular recitations, to prepare and read
before the class and staff of the school two essays or memoirs upon some
battle, campaign, or the military events of some epoch of peculiar
interest.</p>

<p>The topics for these essays are selected by the instructor in
military history, with the approval of the commandant and superintendent
of instruction, and are generally confined to events not prior to the
last two decades of the eighteenth century.</p>

<p>The necessary maps, instruments, and apparatus for the elucidation
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page822" id = "page822">822</a></span>
or practical application of the various subjects of the entire range of
the theoretical course have to a considerable extent been supplied to
the school by requisitions upon the Engineer and Ordnance Departments of
the Army. They are kept in active use, and are of the greatest
value.</p>

<p>Instructions in the theoretical course is confined to the months of
autumn, winter, and the early spring, except instruction in mathematics,
which unavoidably has to be given during the months of May, June, July,
and August.</p>

<p>The course of practical instruction is pursued, as the weather
permits, throughout the entire year, but is more closely attended to
during the months of summer and autumn. This course consists of the
service of every species of gun, howitzer, or mortar in use in the
United States military service; of the use of the various kinds of
projectiles and fuses; the laying of platforms; the use of plane-tables,
and telemeters, for ascertaining ranges; of mechanical manœuvres;
transportation and other handling of all kinds of ordnance, and
particularly of the 15-inch guns and their carriages, and of 13-inch
mortars and their beds, and of other heavy material which has been
adopted into the artillery of the United States.</p>

<p>The practical course also includes very full target practice with
every description of ordnance; the duties of the laboratory, as far as
they immediately concern officers of artillery; and the study of and
recitation in the tactics for light and heavy artillery, and as much of
the tactics for infantry as is essential for artillery officers.</p>

<p>Guns, carriages, ammunition, platforms, artillery machines, including
hydraulic-jacks of greater or less power, and other appliances, are
supplied by requisition on the Ordnance Department in such number and
variety as may be desired. The school is compelled to be indebted to the
Ordnance Department for the occasional use, when necessary, of some of
its instruments and apparatus for determining initial velocities,
pressures, densities, etc.</p>

<p>Instruction in the practical course is designed to be as thorough as
possible, and no officer leaves the school who has not become
practically familiar with the tools of his trade, and able to use them
intelligently.</p>

<p>A school for non-commissioned officers, and for such other enlisted
men as may desire to avail themselves of its advantages, is also
established. Every non-commissioned officer belonging to the five
instruction batteries is required to attend the school for one year’s
full course of instruction; all other enlisted men are permitted to
attend. But their attendance upon school is entirely voluntary.
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page823" id = "page823">823</a></span>
Enlisted men of good character, and belonging to batteries not stationed
at the post where the Artillery School is established, are also
permitted to enjoy the benefits of one year’s course of instruction at
the school. Such men, on their own application, are nominated by their
battery commanders to their regimental commanders, on whose approval
they are detached from their batteries, by orders from the head-quarters
of the Army, and directed to report themselves in person to the
commanding officer of the school. Of this last-named class of men
twenty-two have undergone or are now undergoing instruction at the
school.</p>

<p>The course of instruction for the non-commissioned officers is both
practical and theoretical. The practical course is pursued <i>pari
passu</i> with that of the commissioned officers, but is not carried to
the same extent, being restricted to the scope of the necessary duties
and requirements of non-commissioned officers of artillery, and to the
average capacity of enlisted men of that grade in our Army.</p>

<p>The theoretical course of instruction for the non-commissioned
officers embraces mathematics, history of the United States, geography,
reading, and writing. The subject of mathematics includes the entire
field of arithmetic, and, for the more advanced scholars, it is carried
as far as equations of the second degree in algebra. The instruction in
most of the branches is conducted as in the school for commissioned
officers, by recitations at the blackboard, and by questions.</p>

<p>Since the commencement of the duties of the Artillery School one
hundred and three enlisted men (chiefly non-commissioned officers) have
gone through the entire course of practical and theoretical instruction
for one year, and have been awarded by the staff of the school engraved
certificates, signed by each of its members, setting forth that
fact.</p>

<p>The following-named officers constitute the staff and instructors at
the school at the present date, and, with the above-stated exceptions,
have been thus on duty since its first establishment:</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p><i>Commandant.</i>&mdash;Colonel W. F. Barry, Second Artillery.</p>

</div>

<p>A library of books of reference, professional instruction and general
reading, to the number of 2,050 volumes, belongs to the school, made up
of duplicates from the libraries of the War Department and the Military
Academy, and a bequest of Col. Archer.</p>

<p>A museum of field, siege, and sea-coast artillery; specimens of
primers, fuses, and projectiles; different varieties of small arms of
this and other countries; instruments for inspecting cannon and
projectiles, has been commenced by the Superintendent, as a useful aid
to the course of practical and theoretical instruction in the school. It
now numbers over 4,000 articles.</p>

<p>The Artillery School has been organized and conducted thus far to the
satisfaction of the Department, and favor, with this arm of the service,
without any special pecuniary expense to the Government by the present
Commandant, Col. William F. Barry&mdash;who closes his annual Report
with the remarkable paragraph:&mdash;“No special appropriation (beyond
the ordinary requirements of this Military Post) for the maintenance of
this school are now needed, and none are required.”</p>

<h3><a name = "virginia" id = "virginia" href = "#us">VIRGINIA MILITARY
INSTITUTE AT LEXINGTON.</a></h3>

<p class = "smallhead">HISTORICAL NOTICE.</p>

<p><span class = "firstword">The</span> <span class =
"smallcaps">Virginia Military Institute</span> at Lexington, was
established in 1839, and was organized and conducted from the start on
the plan of the Military Academy at West Point, by Col. Francis H.
Smith, a graduate of that institution of the class of 1833, and
professor there from 1834 to 1836.</p>

<p>The State makes an annual appropriation of $15,000 for its support,
on the basis of which a certain number (usually&nbsp;36) cadets are
admitted without charge; in consideration of which they are required to
teach in some school of the State for two years after graduation. In the
selection of State cadets regard is had to their capacity to profit, and
inability to pay the expenses of tuition and board, and an equal
representation of each senatorial district. Any commissioned officer of
the militia of the State can become a student for a period not exceeding
ten months, and receive instruction in any or all departments of
military science taught therein, without charge for tuition.</p>

<p>The course of instruction was from the start distinctly scientific,
and since its return [from Richmond where it was removed after the
destruction of its building and library, when Lexington was taken
possession of by Gen. Hunter] in 1866, and its reorganization on its
present basis of a general School of Applied Science, it has become even
technic in reference to all the chief industries and natural resources
of Virginia.</p>

<p>The origin and military character of the Institute are thus set forth
by the Superintendent in an address to the Corps of Cadets, Sept. 10,
1866:</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>Peculiar circumstances gave to this Institution its distinctive
military character. Here the State had a deposit of arms, in an arsenal,
which had been established for many years before the organization of the
Institution, and the annuity which had been formerly given to the public
guard by the State, was transferred to the Virginia Military Institute,
as the basis of its support. Upon this foundation the Virginia Military
Institute was established, and as the duty imposed upon the cadet was
military, so military discipline and military instruction became an
essential and distinctive feature in the education it supplied. Besides
daily exercises in the school of the soldier, company, and battalion in
<i>infantry</i>, and of the piece and battery in <i>artillery</i>
tactics, minute instruction is
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page826" id = "page826">826</a></span>
given in the class-room, upon all the theoretic branches of the military
art, embracing, in addition to those enumerated, <i>ordnance</i> and
<i>gunnery</i>, <i>military strategy</i> and <i>military history</i>,
and the principles and practice of field and permanent
fortifications.</p>

<p>It is not necessary that I should say any thing, at this time, to
vindicate the completeness of the arrangements made in this institution
for theoretical and practical military education. The sanguinary
conflict which has just closed has fully tested its efficiency.
<i>One-tenth</i> of the Confederate Armies was commanded by the éléves
of this school, embracing three <i>major generals</i>, thirty
<i>brigadier generals</i>, sixty <i>colonels</i>, fifty <i>lieutenant
colonels</i>, thirty <i>majors</i>, one hundred and twenty-five
<i>captains</i>, between two and three hundred <i>lieutenants</i>; and
the terrible results of the battles, in numbering one hundred and
twenty-five of these among the <i>killed</i>, and three hundred and
fifty among the <i>wounded</i>, show that the éléves of this institution
met the call of their country with an earnestness of devotion which
places them in most honorable distinction for their heroic defense of
what they believed to be right.<a class = "tag" name = "tag10_17" id =

<p class = "smallhead">IV. SYSTEM OF INSTRUCTION AND GOVERNMENT.</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>The System of Instruction and Government is founded upon that of the
United States Military Academy at West Point.</p>

<p>As soon as a young man enters the Institution, it assumes over him an
entire control, and not only directs his moral and intellectual
education, but provides every thing required for his personal wants or
comfort. A&nbsp;Cadet, may, if his parents desire it, remain in charge
of the Institution for the entire term of four years, as the system of
government keeps it always in operation. The months of July and August,
in each year, are devoted exclusively to Military Exercises. Furloughs
are granted to those who may desire it, in turn, during this period. The
Cadets are lodged and boarded in the Institution, their Clothing, Books,
and other supplies, being provided by the Quartermaster of the
Institute, <i>at cost</i>. The sick are under the special care of the
Surgeon, with Hospital and other facilities for nursing.</p>

<p>The energy, system, subordination, and self-reliance which the
military government of the Institute cultivates, give a practical
character to the education which it supplies. The high reputation which
its Alumni have established for the School is the evidence of its
value.</p>
</div>


<p class = "smallhead">V. DEGREES.</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>A Diploma, signed by the Governor of Virginia and by the Visitors and
Faculty, is awarded to all Cadets who may pass approved examinations on
all the studies of the Academic School, with the title of “<i>Graduate

all who may complete the course prescribed for either of the <i>Special
Schools of Applied Science</i>, with the title of “<i>Graduate</i>” in

STATE SCHOOLS OF SCIENCE.</a></h3>

<p class = "smallhead">INTRODUCTION.</p>

<p><span class = "firstword">In</span> the Act of Congress (July, 1862)
making grants of public lands to the several States for the endowment of
State Schools of Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts, it is provided that
military tactics shall be included in their schemes of instruction; and
by an Act of March, 1869, the President is authorized to detail an army
officer to each institution, to instruct in such tactics. On these two
provisions, with further cooperative legislation, State and National, a
system of military instruction can be gradually developed, which, for
economy, efficiency, and uniformity, will meet all the conditions of a
national armament, and compare favorably, as against foreign invasion or
domestic insurrection, with that of Switzerland or Prussia. Thus far the
subject has received only slight attention, and the connection of these
departments with the State militia, or volunteer companies, or the
appointment of cadets to our national military schools or to vacancies
in the army, has not been discussed. We state briefly what is attempted
in a few of these schools:</p>


<p class = "smallhead"><a name = "state_cornell" id = "state_cornell"
href = "#state">CORNELL UNIVERSITY AT ITHACA, N.Y.</a></p>

<p>In Cornell University (to which the United States Land Grant of
989,000 acres of land was assigned by the Legislature of New York, and
which Mr. Ezra Cornell has endowed with the sum of $525,000, securely
invested and drawing interest at seven per cent.), the military tactics
is incorporated into the general organization of the students, and made
the basis of the College of Military Science. (1.) Attendance on
military exercises is made obligatory on every able-bodied student; and
for this purpose the whole number is organized into a military
corps&mdash;arms and equipments being furnished by the State&mdash;under
the Military Professor, who has the title of Commandant, and is aided in
his duties by a staff, selected in view of military aptitude, general
deportment, and proficiency in studies. (2.) All students are required
to observe and conform to such regulations as may, from time to time, be
promulgated by the Commandant; provide themselves with the university
cap for ordinary wear, and with the blouse or fatigue cap for parade;
and are
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page830" id = "page830">830</a></span>
held to strict accountability for the proper use of the arms and other
property issued to them. (3.) The practical instruction for all students
embraces infantry and artillery tactics, and special exercises with the
sabre, sword, and bayonet; and (4.) for those who elect, a military
course consisting of (a.) <i>Military Engineering</i>, (b.) <i>the Art
of War</i>, and (c.) <i>Military Law</i>. At the close of each year,
after the graduating exercises, the Faculty will recommend to the
Governor of the State a list (not exceeding one in every ten of such
graduates), distinguished for general proficiency in any one of the
complete University courses, special attainments in military science,
expertness in military exercises, and of good moral character and of
sound health, with a request to transmit the same to the President of

<p>The Committee of Examination for 1870 report as follows:</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>Your Committee can not refrain from alluding to the interest which
all the young men take in the drills, the evident beneficial effect upon
their bearing and health, and the value of the accomplished soldiers and
officers thus, made for the future service of the Commonwealth, in the
event of another call to send forth her sons for herself or the nation.
Were no other result accomplished by this institution, the money of the
Commonwealth could be no more judiciously expended, and yet this is but
an incident to the regular course.</p>

<p>The Principal, Col. Clark, writes: “We have a fine hall for in-door
exercise, and are furnished by the State with cannon, breech-loading
rifles, sabres, &amp;c., and consider our course a decided success. Our
graduates are able to act as officers in infantry and artillery
regiments, and I believe our system, as we are organized and taught by a
West Point graduate, a most excellent and economical substitute for the
ordinary militia system.”</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Louisiana State University</span> was
founded as “a State Seminary of Learning and Military Academy” by the
Legislature in 1855, near Alexandria, in the Parish of Rapides, on
endowments of land made by the General Government at different times,
from 1806 to 1827, for establishing “a Seminary of Learning.” It was
opened for the reception of students, January 2, 1860, and organized on
a military basis, under the superintendence of Col. W.&nbsp;T. Sherman
(now General-in-Chief, United States Army), who resigned his position,
February 2, 1861, on the hostile demonstration of the State of Louisiana
against the authority of the United States. The instruction of the
institution continued under Col. W.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;M. Linfield, till April
22, 1863, when its operations were closed by the disasters of the War,
to be reopened on the first of October, 1865, only to be closed again by
the utter destruction of its extensive buildings by fire on the 15th of
October, 1869. On the 1st of November following, its exercises were
resumed at Baton Rouge, in the extensive building of the Asylum for the
Deaf and Dumb, which was placed temporarily for the occupancy of the
classes, and a portion of the students. The session of 1871, under the
superintendence of Col. D.&nbsp;F. Boyd, closed with 217 matriculated
Cadets, of whom 128 were admitted on the State Cadet warrants.</p>

<p>The Law of March 16, 1870, relative to the appointment of Beneficiary
Cadets, provides that each parish shall delegate two, and the city of
New Orleans, by its Board of School Directors, twenty cadets, to be
selected from the members of the highest class in the public school of
such parishes and city, distinguished for their scholarship and good
conduct, and whose parents may not be able to provide for their
necessary expenses for tuition and maintenance at the State Seminary;
and at the expiration of their residence at the University which can not
exceed four years, these Beneficiary Cadets are required to teach school
within the State for two years, on penalty of default to the amount of
the sum paid by the State.</p>

service of seven thousand five hundred feet, is thus divided:
A&nbsp;marching and running course, of three hundred feet, twelve feet
wide, and seventeen feet high; a gymnasium sixty feet by twenty-six, and
twenty-four feet high, ventilated and lighted by a central tower fifty
feet in height; an armory and gun-room, for care of small arms and

<div class = "in-one">
<p>The gratifying success with which the military department of the
State University has been conducted is worthy of special notice, and I
am happy to announce that perfect discipline and a high state of
proficiency pervade the department of military study at that
institution. The cadets were incorporated with the National Guard of the
State by Act of the last legislature, and have been formed into four
companies of infantry, and instructed most fully and perfectly in that
branch of military service. A&nbsp;personal inspection of the battalion
enables me to speak of its condition with confidence. I&nbsp;find both
officers and cadets thoroughly up to the requirements of the infantry
soldier, perfect in carriage, most proficient in the use of arms, steady
in marching and all company formations, and, in the manœuvres of the
battalion, challenging an admiration worthy to be elicited by a veteran
soldiery. Their <i>ensemble</i> is striking, and the effect of a
thorough military training upon the young gentlemen of the University is
largely manifested in their erect and graceful personal appearance and
movements, apparent not only when upon duty but in their ordinary walks
of every-day occupation; while the gentlemanly and high-toned courtesy
that pervades the whole body may not unjustly be attributed, in a large
degree, to their military studies and military habits. The young
officers evince excellent characteristics of command, great dignity of
deportment and admirable ability in imparting instruction. I&nbsp;can
not too highly commend to your attention the whole military condition of
the cadets of the State University, and to ask for them your fostering
care and encouragement, and that of the Legislature.</p>

<p>There are several colleges in California in which military
instruction is introduced; prominent among them is St. Augustine College
at Benicia, and McClure’s Academy at Oakland. At each there are about

PARTRIDGE.</a></h4>

<p><span class = "firstword">Alden Partridge</span>, Captain in the
United States Corps of Engineers, Professor and Superintendent of the
Military Academy at West Point, and the Founder of a class of
institutions in which the military element is recognized and provided
for as an essential part of the training of the American citizen, was
born at Norwich in Vermont, on the 12th of January, 1785. His father was
a farmer, in independent circumstances, served in the war of the
Revolution, and took part in the capture of Burgoyne and his army at
Saratoga. He brought up his son in the New England fashion, at such
district school as the times and the country afforded in the winter, and
at all sorts of work about the house and on the farm at other seasons,
until he was sixteen years of age, when, being of studious turn, and
fond of reading, he was allowed to fit for college, and entered
Dartmouth in August, 1802. We have no knowledge of his studies in
college, but it is presumed that his predilections were for the
mathematics, and from the lateness with which he commenced his Latin and
his subsequent declarations, his aversion was for the languages. Before
completing his collegiate course he received the appointment of cadet<a
class = "tag" name = "tag10_20" id = "tag10_20" href =
"#note10_20">20</a> in the regiment of artillerists in the United States
service, with orders to repair to West Point, and report himself to the
commanding officer of the Military Academy at that place.</p>

<p>The Military Academy at the time Cadet Partridge arrived at West
Point was very inadequately equipped with the men and material aids of
instruction, although the two teachers appointed
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page834" id = "page834">834</a></span>
were abundantly capable in their respective departments. Jared
Mansfield, especially, the teacher of natural philosophy, had won such
reputation in mathematical studies that he received his commission as a
captain of engineers from Mr. Jefferson for the very purpose of becoming
a teacher at West Point, which he did by appointment in 1802, although
in reality he did not perform his duties regularly, and then only for
one year, having been, in 1808, appointed by President Jefferson to the
responsible post of Surveyor-General of the North-western territory.
Such instruction as was given was received by Cadet Partridge in 1806,
and in July of that year, he was transferred to the Corps of Engineers,
and in October, commissioned as first lieutenant. In November, 1806, he
was appointed assistant professor of mathematics, Fedinand K. Hassler, a
little later, having been made Professor in place of Capt. Barron,
retired. From Prof. Hassler, he received great help in his mathematical
studies, as he afterwards repeatedly acknowledged. In 1808, Prof.
Partridge was called to act in place of the Superintendent in the
absence of Col. Williams, and continued to do so, with brief intervals,
until January, 1815, when he was appointed to the office which he filled
till March, 1816. In 1809, Mr. Hassler resigned the professorship of
mathematics, and the instruction before given by him devolved on his
assistant, Mr. Partridge. In 1810, he succeeded, after repeated
applications to the Secretary of War, in obtaining two field pieces, for
practical instruction of the Cadets as Artillerists.</p>

<p>In 1812, the Academy was re-organized, and was made to consist of the
Corps of Engineers and the following Professors, in addition to the
teachers of the French language and drawing, viz.: “one professor of
natural and experimental philosophy; one professor of mathematics; and
one professor of the art of engineering; each professor to have an
assistant taken from the most prominent of the Officers or Cadets.” The
number of Cadets was increased to two hundred and fifty, and were
directed to be arranged into companies of non-commissioned officers and
privates, according to the directions of the commandant of Engineers,
and be officered from that corps, “for the purposes of military
instruction, in all the duties of a private, non-commissioned officer,
and officer, and to be encamped at least three months of each year, and
taught all the duties incident to a regular camp.” The age of admission
was fixed, the minimum at fourteen, and maximum at twenty-one, and
preliminary knowledge to be well versed in reading, writing, and
arithmetic. It was further provided that any Cadet who shall receive a
regular degree from the Academical Staff, after going through all the
classes,
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page835" id = "page835">835</a></span>
shall be considered among the candidates for a commission in any corps,
according to the duties he may be judged competent to perform. The sum
of $25,000 was appropriated towards the buildings, library, implements,
&amp;c. On this broad basis the Academy was progressively enlarged to
its present capabilities of usefulness.</p>

<p>Under the new arrangement of 1812, Mr. Partridge was appointed
professor of mathematics, with the pay and emoluments of a major, which
appointment was soon after, at the request of the Secretary of War,
exchanged for that of professor of engineering, it being found more
difficult to fill the latter post than the former. The duties of this
professorship he continued to discharge from September 1, 1813, till
December 31, 1816.</p>

<p>In 1808, Capt. Partridge was ordered by Col. Williams to take charge
of the internal direction and control of the Military Academy as
Superintendent, which duties he discharged until January 3, 1815, when,
by regulations of that date, he was made the permanent Superintendent,
which post he held-till November 25th, 1816, and was finally relieved on
the 13th of January, 1817.</p>

<p>By the regulation of January 3, 1815, the commandant of the Corps of
Engineers was constituted <i>Inspector</i> of the Academy, and made
responsible for instruction, and to report to the Department of War. Out
of this appointment, and the instructions relating thereto, grew a
difference of opinion, which resulted in the final withdrawal of Capt.
Partridge from the institution, the resignation of his commission in the
military service of the United States, and his subsequent devotion to
the dissemination by lectures and personal efforts of the views which he
had formed of the education required by the American citizen, and the
establishment of institutions in which these views could be carried
out.</p>

<p>After resigning his commission in the military service of the United
States, Capt. Partridge was engaged, in the summer of 1818, as military
instructor to a volunteer corps, and in giving a course of lectures on
fortifications and other branches of military science to a class of
officers and citizens in the city of New York. The views which he then
presented on the best means of national defense were in advance of the
“piping times of peace” in 1818, but have been since demanded to be
eminently sound and practical by the terrible experience of
1861&ndash;1862.</p>

<p>His chief reliance for national defense was in the <i>military
habits</i> of the great body of the American people&mdash;organized into
suitable militia departments corresponding in the main to the limits of
the several states, officered by men of the right capacity, scientific
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page836" id = "page836">836</a></span>
education, and military training. The officers were required to assemble
annually at stated periods, either in camps or rendezvous, at some
central point in the department, to receive instruction from a few
competent teachers of the military art. We give the plan in his own
language as published at the time.</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>I. Let the United States be divided into military departments, say
thirty in number; each of those departments to be wholly comprised
within the same state, whenever this can be done.</p>

<p>II. To each of those departments let there be attached a military
instructor, (under the authority of the United States,) who should
receive the pay and emoluments of a colonel of infantry, and have the
brevet-rank of a brigadier-general. These instructors to be gentlemen of
established character and reputation, and who have received a regular
scientific military education.</p>

<p>III. Let the officers of each brigade of militia in the United States
be required to assemble annually at stated periods, either in camp or
rendezvous at some central point in the brigade, there to remain six
days, for the purpose of military instruction. Let each instructor
attend in succession at the several camps or places of rendezvous in his
department, and devote himself assiduously to the instruction of the
officers there assembled. One portion of the day might be devoted to
practical drills, and field evolutions&mdash;also to the turning off,
mounting, and relieving guards and sentinels, while the remainder could
be most usefully employed in explaining and illustrating the principles
of tactics generally, of artillery, of permanent and field
fortification, the duties of troops in camp and in garrison, and such
other branches as time and circumstances might permit, by means of
familiar explanatory lectures.</p>

<p>IV. Let each officer receive from the government a reasonable
allowance for his expenses while attending the instruction, and also
while going to, and returning from, the camp or rendezvous.</p>

<p>Some of the principal advantages that would result from the adoption
of the foregoing plan, I&nbsp;conceive would be as follows;
viz.:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The same system of tactics and discipline would pervade the whole
mass of the militia&mdash;the instructors being imperatively required to
adhere to one system. This would be a very important advantage.</p>

<p>2. By this means the country, in the course of a few years, would be
furnished with a well organized military force, of at least one million
of men, composed of the best materials in the world for soldiers; the
whole of which, the officers having been regularly and correctly
instructed, might be rendered, in the course of a few weeks, after being
called into service, perfectly competent to the efficient discharge of
all the duties of the field. This assertion is not founded upon
conjecture. An experience of nearly fifteen years in military
instruction, has convinced me, that any of our regiments of militia, in
their present state of discipline, if brought into the field and placed
under competent officers, could, by three weeks instruction, be prepared
for discharging all the duties of regular troops. The instruction, then,
in time of peace, of the officers, becomes an object of great
importance;&mdash;that of the privates is of secondary consideration.
There is no difficulty in making soldiers, when officers understand
their duty, and are disposed to perform it.</p>

<p>It may perhaps be objected to the foregoing plan, that the time
proposed for the officers to remain in camp or rendezvous is too limited
to admit of their deriving much advantage therefrom. In answer to this I
will observe, that a due share of experience in this species of
instruction, has fully convinced me, that they would acquire more
correct military information in six days, under a competent and
systematic instructor, than they usually acquire under the present
system, during the whole period from eighteen to forty-five years of
age; and that, after attending two or three similar courses, the great
body of them would be perfectly competent to the correct, efficient, and
useful discharge of all the duties of the field. From the best
calculation I have been able to make,
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page837" id = "page837">837</a></span>
I feel confident, that the whole necessary expense of carrying this plan
into full and effective operation, would not exceed six hundred thousand
dollars&mdash;it would probably fall short of that sum. Whether the
expense, then, is to be considered as disproportionate to the object in
view, and therefore to constitute a barrier to its accomplishment, must
be decided by the sound discretion of the representatives of the people.
It appears to me, however, to bear no greater ratio to it, than does a
grain of sand to the globe we inhabit. The cultivation of military
science must also be viewed as of the first importance in a system of
military defense for our country. The plan already detailed, is
calculated for the general dissemination of practical military
information throughout the community, but is not adapted to the
investigation of principles. This can only be done at seminaries, where
it constitutes a branch of regular attention and study; and where theory
and practice can, in due proportion, be combined. At those seminaries
would be formed our military instructors, our engineers, and our
generals; and from those, as from so many foci, would all the
improvements in the military art be diffused throughout the country.</p>
</div>

<p>In the lectures delivered in 1818, Capt, Partridge, in view of the
Inevitable disintegration by frost and moisture, and the improvements in
the science of attack, anticipated the insufficiency of permanent
fortifications&mdash;of works of masonry, no matter how expensively or
strongly constructed&mdash;to the defense of our principal harbors
against the attacks of a foreign foe; his reliance was on the general
diffusion of military science and training amongst the militia, on an
efficient navy, and the following plan of marine defense.</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>I. At the most important and exposed points on our seaboard, let one
or two principal works of the most permanent kind be erected: these
works to be kept in perfect repair, to be plentifully supplied with all
the munitions of war, and the gun’s and carriages well secured from the
weather by means of pent houses.</p>

<p>II. In the vicinity of all the most exposed and vulnerable points on
the seaboard, let spacious and permanent arsenals be constructed, in
which, let there be deposited ample supplies of cannon, mortars, gun
carriages, materials for platforms, and other munitions of war, where
they would remain perfectly safe from the weather.</p>

<p>III. In case of war or threatened invasion, let temporary works,
either of earth, or of wood, be constructed at all the most vulnerable
points, which could be readily furnished with cannon, gun carriages,
platforms, and all the necessary implements and munitions from the
arsenals in their vicinity.</p>

<p>IV. As soon as peace is restored, these works should be dismantled,
and all their apparatus returned to the arsenals from whence it was
taken. In case of future emergencies, they could be restored, or others
of the same descriptions, constructed in their places, which could be
supplied from the arsenals in the manner above stated. The efficacy in
marine defense, of works of the above description, I&nbsp;presume will
not be doubted by any scientific military man. Should any one, however,
be disposed to doubt it, I&nbsp;would beg leave to refer him to the
defense of Fort Moultrie, in the harbor of Charleston, South Carolina,
when attacked by the British shipping, during the Revolutionary war, and
also to the defense made by the small fort at Stonington, Connecticut,
when attacked in a similar manner during the last war.</p>

<p>By adopting this system, I think the following advantages would
result:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. A more secure defense would be obtained. By knowing the
description of force we had to encounter, we should be enabled to
construct our temporary works in a manner the best calculated to repel
it; and as the gun carriages, platforms, and implements, when taken from
the arsenals, would be sound and in perfect order, we might reasonably
calculate these works would make a more
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page838" id = "page838">838</a></span>
vigorous resistance than permanent ones, which, with their apparatus,
are in a state of partial dilapidation and decay.</p>

<p>2. The system would be much less expensive than the one by permanent
fortification. Those temporary works could ordinarily be constructed by
the troops with very little, if any, additional expense; but in case of
pressing emergency, the zeal and patriotism of the people might be
relied upon with safety, to supply any amount of labor that might be
necessary, as was the case at New York in 1814. As it is not proposed
they should be retained as military stations in time of peace, the
expense of keeping them in repair would be nothing.</p>
</div>

<p>In the early part of 1819, Capt. Partridge was engaged in the
exploring survey of the North Eastern boundary, under the fifth article
of the treaty of Ghent. While on this survey he determined from
barometrical and thermometrical observations of the altitudes of the
Highlands dividing the rivers which flow northerly into the St.
Lawrence, from those which flow southerly into the Atlantic ocean; he
also made a profile of the country between several points on the St.
Lawrence, and corresponding position in the state of Maine.</p>

<p>In 1820, Capt. Partridge resigned his position in this survey, for
the purpose of carrying into practical effect a plan of education, which
had occupied much of his attention since 1810, and which in its main
features was, doubtless, suggested by his experience at Hanover, and
West Point, and was calculated to supply certain deficiencies which he
and others had already noticed in our American colleges and higher
seminaries of learning. His views both of the deficiencies and their
remedies were set forth in a lecture delivered at this time, which was
subsequently printed. After defining “education in its most perfect
state to be the preparing a youth in the best possible manner for the
correct discharge of the duties of any station in which he may be
placed,” in this lecture he proceeds to characterize the existing plan
of instruction.</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>1. It is not sufficiently practical, nor properly adapted to the
various duties an American citizen may be called upon to discharge.
Those of our youth who are destined for a liberal education, as it is
called, are usually put, at an early age, to the study of the Latin and
Greek languages, combining therewith a very slight attention to their
own language, the elements of arithmetic, &amp;c.; and after having
devoted several years in this way, they are prepared to become members
of a college or university.</p>

<p>Here they spend four years for the purpose of acquiring a knowledge
of the higher branches of learning; after which, they receive their
diplomat, and are supposed to be prepared to enter on the duties of
active life. But, I&nbsp;would ask, is this actually the case? Are they
prepared in the best possible manner to discharge correctly the duties
of any station in which fortune or inclination may place them? Have they
been instructed in the science of government generally, and more
especially in the principles of our excellent Constitution, and thereby
prepared to sit in the legislative councils of the nation? Has their
attention been sufficiently directed to those great and important
branches of national industry and sources of national
wealth&mdash;agriculture, commerce, and
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page839" id = "page839">839</a></span>
manufactures? Have they been taught to examine the policy of other
nations, and the effect of that policy on the prosperity of their own
country? Are they prepared to discharge the duties of civil or military
engineers, or to endure fatigue, or to become the defenders of their
country’s rights, and the avengers of her wrongs, either in the ranks or
at the head of her armies? It appears to me not; and if not, then,
agreeably to the standard established, their education is so far
defective.</p>

<p>2. Another defect in the present system, is, the entire neglect, in
all our principal seminaries, of physical education, or the due
cultivation and improvement of the physical powers of the students.</p>

<p>The great importance and even absolute necessity of a regular and
systematic course of exercise for the preservation of health, and
confirming and rendering vigorous the constitution, I&nbsp;presume, must
be evident to the most superficial observer. It is for want of this,
that so many of our most promising youths lose their health by the time
they are prepared to enter on the grand theatre of active and useful
life, and either prematurely die, or linger out a comparatively useless
and miserable existence. That the health of the closest applicant may be
preserved, when he is subjected to a regular and systematic course of
exercises, I know, from practical experience; and I have no hesitation
in asserting, that in nine cases out of ten, it is just as easy for a
youth, however hard he may study, to attain the age of manhood, with a
firm and vigorous constitution, capable of enduring exposure, hunger and
fatigue, as it is to grow up puny and debilitated, incapable of either
bodily or mental exertion.</p>

<p>3. A third defect in our system is, the amount of idle time allowed
the students; that portion of the day during which they are actually
engaged in study and recitations, under the eye of their instructors,
comprises but a small portion of the whole; during the remainder, those
that are disposed to study, will improve at their rooms, while those who
are not so disposed, will not only not improve, but will be very likely
to engage in practices injurious to their constitutions and destructive
to their morals. If this vacant time could be employed in duties and
exercises, which, while they amuse and improve the mind, would at the
same time invigorate the body and confirm the constitution, it would
certainly be a great point gained. That this may be done, I&nbsp;shall
attempt in the course of these observations, to show.</p>

<p>4. A fourth defect is, the allowing to students, especially to those
of the wealthier class, too much money, thereby inducing habits of
dissipation and extravagance, highly injurious to themselves, and also
to the seminaries of which they are members. I&nbsp;have no hesitation
in asserting, that far the greater portion of the irregularities and
disorderly proceedings amongst the students of our seminaries, may be
traced to this fatal cause. Collect together at any seminary, a large
number of youths, of the ages they generally are at our institutions,
furnish them with money, and allow them a portion of idle time, and it
may be viewed as a miracle, if a large portion of them do not become
corrupt in morals, and instead of going forth into the world to become
ornaments in society, they rather are prepared to become nuisances to
the same. There is in this respect, an immense responsibility resting on
parents and guardians, as well as on all others having the care and
instruction of youth, of which it appears to me they are not
sufficiently aware.</p>

<p>When youths are sent to a seminary, it is presumed they are sent for
the purpose of learning something that is useful, and not to acquire bad
habits, or to spend money; they should consequently be furnished with
every thing necessary for their comfort, convenience and improvement,
but money should in no instance be put into their hands. So certainly as
they have it, just so certainly will they spend it, and this will, in
nine cases out of ten, be done in a manner seriously to injure them,
without any corresponding advantage. It frequently draws them into
vicious and dissolute company, and induces habits of immorality and
vice, which ultimately prove their ruin. The over-weening indulgence of
parents, has been the cause of the destruction of the morals and future
usefulness of many a promising youth. They may eventually discover their
error, but alas, it is often too late to correct it. Much better does
that person discharge the duties of a real friend to the thoughtless,
unwary youth, who withholds from him the means of indulging in
dissipated and vicious courses.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page840" id = "page840">840</a></span>
<p>5. A fifth defect is the requiring all the students to pursue the
same course of studies.</p>

<p>All youth have not the same inclinations, nor the same capacities;
one may possess a particular inclination and capacity for the study of
the classics, but not for the mathematics and other branches of science;
with another it may be the reverse. Now it will be in vain to attempt
making a mathematician of the former, or a linguist of the latter.
Consequently, all the time that is devoted in this manner, will be lost,
or something worse than lost. Every youth, who has any capacity or
inclination for the acquirement of knowledge, will have some favorite
studies, in which he will be likely to excel. It is certainly then much
better that he should be permitted to pursue those, than, that by being
forced to attend to others for which he has an aversion, and in which he
will never excel, or ever make common proficiency, he should finally
acquire a dislike to all study. The celebrated Pascal, is a striking
instance of the absurdity and folly of attempting to force a youth to
attend to branches of study, for which he has an utter aversion, to the
exclusion of those for which he may possess a particular attachment. Had
the father of this eminent man persisted in his absurd and foolish
course, France would never have seen him, what he subsequently became,
one of her brightest ornaments.</p>

<p>6. A sixth defect is the prescribing the length of time for
completing, as it is termed, a course of education. By these means, the
good scholar is placed nearly on a level with the sluggard, for whatever
may be his exertions, he can gain nothing in respect to time, and the
latter has, in consequence of this, less stimulus for exertion. If any
thing will induce the indolent student to exert himself, it is the
desire to prevent others getting ahead of him. It would be much better
to allow each one to progress as rapidly as possible, with a thorough
understanding of the subject.</p>
</div>

<p>Having stated what appeared to him the most prominent defects in the
academies and colleges as organized and conducted, he next proceeds to
point out the remedies.</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>1. The organization and discipline should be strictly military.</p>

<p>Under a military system, subordination and discipline are much more
easily preserved than under any other. Whenever a youth can be impressed
with the true principles and feelings of a soldier, he becomes, as a
matter of course, subordinate, honorable, and manly. He disdains
subterfuge and prevarication, and all that low cunning, which is but too
prevalent. He acts not the part of the assassin, but if he have an
enemy, he meets him openly and fairly. Others may boast that they have
broken the laws and regulations of the institution of which they are, or
have been members, and have escaped detection and punishment, by mean
prevarication and falsehood. Not so the real soldier. If he have broken
orders and regulations, he will openly acknowledge his error, and
reform; but will not boast of having been insubordinate. Those
principles, if imbibed and fixed in early youth, will continue to
influence his conduct and actions during life; he will be equally
observant of the laws of his country, as of the academic regulations
under which he has lived; and will become the more estimable citizen in
consequence thereof. I&nbsp;shall not pretend, however, that all who
wear a military garb, or live, for a time, even under a correct system
of military discipline, will be influenced in their conduct by the
principles above stated; but if they are not, it only proves that they
have previously imbibed erroneous principles, which have become too
firmly fixed to be eradicated; or that nature has not formed them with
minds capable of soaring above what is low and groveling.</p>

<p>2. Military science and instruction should constitute a part of the
course of education.</p>

<p>The constitution of the United States has invested the military
defense of the country in the great body of the people. By the wise
provisions of this instrument, and of the laws made in pursuance
thereof, every American citizen, from eighteen to forty-five years of
age, unless specially exempted by law, is liable
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page841" id = "page841">841</a></span>
to be called upon for the discharge of military duty&mdash;he is
emphatically a citizen soldier, and it appears to me perfectly proper
that he should be equally prepared by education to discharge, correctly,
his duties in either capacity. If we intend to avoid a standing army,
(that bane of a republic, and engine of oppression in the hands of
despots,) our militia must be patronized and improved, and military
information must be disseminated amongst the great mass of the people;
when deposited with them, it is in safe hands, and will never be
exhibited in practice, except in opposition to the enemies of the
country. I&nbsp;am well aware there are amongst us many worthy
individuals, who deem the cultivation of military science a sort of
heresy, flattering themselves, and endeavoring to induce others to
believe, that the time has now arrived, or is very near, when wars are
to cease, and universal harmony prevail amongst mankind. But, my
fellow-citizens, be not deceived by the syren song of peace, peace,
when, in reality, there is no peace, except in a due and constant
preparation for war. If we turn our attention to Europe, what do we
behold? A&nbsp;league of crowned despots, impiously called holy,
wielding a tremendous military force of two millions of mercenaries!
Ill-fated Naples, and more ill-fated Spain, have both felt the effects
of <i>their peaceable</i> dispositions, and were it not for the
wide-spreading Atlantic, which the God of nature in his infinite
goodness has interposed between us, we also, ere this, should have had a
like experience. The principles of liberty are equally obnoxious to
them, whether found in Europe, Asia, Africa, or America. If rendering
mankind ignorant of the art of war, (as&nbsp;a science,) would prevent
wars, then would I unite most cordially with those, usually termed
peace-men, for the purpose of destroying every vestige of it. But such,
I am confident, would not be the result. Wars amongst nations do not
arise because they understand how to conduct them skillfully and on
scientific principles; but are induced by the evil propensities and
dispositions of mankind. To prevent the effect, the cause must be
removed. We may render nations ignorant of the use of the musket and
bayonet; we may carry them back, as respects the art of war, to a state
of barbarism, or even of savageism, and still wars will exist. So long
as mankind possess the dispositions which they now possess, and which
they ever have possessed, so long they will fight. To prevent wars,
then, the disposition must be changed; no remedy short of this, will be
effectual. In proportion as nations are rude and unskilled in the art of
war, will their military code be barbarous and unrelenting, their
battles sanguinary, and their whole system of warfare, destructive. War,
therefore, in such a case, becomes a far greater evil, than it does
under an improved and refined system, where battles are won more by
skill than by hard fighting, and the laws of war are proportionally
ameliorated. What rational man, what friend of mankind, would be willing
to exchange the present humane and refined system of warfare, for that
practiced by an Attila, a Jenghis Khan, a Tamerlane, or a Mahomet, when
hundreds of thousands fell in a single engagement, and when conquest and
extermination were synonymous terms. On the principles of humanity,
then, it appears to me that, so long as wars do exist, the military art
should be improved and refined as much as possible; for, in proportion
as this is done, battles will be less sanguinary and destructive, the
whole system more humane, and war itself a far less evil. But
independent of any connection with the profession of arms, or of any of
the foregoing considerations, I&nbsp;consider a scientific knowledge of
the military art, as constituting a very important part of the education
of every individual engaged in the pursuit of useful knowledge, and this
for many reasons; viz.:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>First.</i> It is of great use in the reading of history, both
ancient and modern.</p>

<p>A large portion of history is made up of accounts of military
operations, descriptions of battles, sieges, &amp;c. How, I&nbsp;would
ask, is the reader to understand this part, if he be ignorant of the
organization of armies, of the various systems of military tactics, of
the science of fortification, and of the attack and defense of fortified
places, both in ancient and modern times? Without such knowledge it is
evident he derives, comparatively but little information from a large
portion of what he reads.</p>

<p><i>Second.</i> It is of great importance in the writing of history.
I&nbsp;presume it will not be denied, that in order to write well on any
subject, it must be understood.
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page842" id = "page842">842</a></span>
How, then, can the historian give a correct and intelligible account of
a campaign, battle, or siege, who is not only unacquainted with the
principles on which military operations are conducted, but is also
ignorant of the technical language necessary for communicating his ideas
intelligibly on the subject? This is the principal reason why, as it
appears to me, the ancient historians were so much superior to the
modern. Many of their best historical writers were military men. Some of
them accomplished commanders. The account of military operations by such
writers as Xenophon, Thucydides, Polybius and Cæsar, are perfectly clear
and intelligible, whereas when attempted by the great body of modern
historians, the most we can learn is, that a fortress was besieged and
taken, or that a battle was fought and a victory won, but are left in
entire ignorance of the principles on which the operations were
conducted, or of the reasons why the results were as they were.</p>

<p><i>Third.</i> It is essentially necessary for the legislator.</p>

<p>The military defense of our country is doubtless one of the most
important trusts which is vested by the constitution in the general
government, and it is a well known fact, that more money is drawn from
the people and disbursed in the military, than in any other department
of the government. Now as all must be done under the sanction of the
law, I&nbsp;would beg leave to inquire, whether it be not of the
greatest importance, that those who are to make such laws should be in
every respect well prepared to legislate understandingly on the subject?
That there has been, and still is, a want of information on this subject
amongst the great body of the members of Congress, I&nbsp;think will be
perfectly evident to any one who is competent, and will take the trouble
to examine our military legislation since the conclusion of the
Revolutionary war. I&nbsp;feel little hesitation in asserting, that from
want of this information, more than from any other cause, as much money
has been uselessly expended in our military department alone, as would
cancel a large portion of the national debt.</p>

<p><i>Fourth.</i> It is of great use to the traveler.</p>

<p>Suppose a young man, with the best education he can obtain at any of
our colleges or universities, were to visit Europe, where the military
constitutes the first class of the community, and where the
fortifications constitute the most important appendages to nearly all
the principal cities, how much does he observe, which he does not
understand? If he attempt a description of the cities, he finds himself
embarrassed for want of a knowledge of fortification. If he attempt an
investigation of the principles and organization of their institutions,
or of their governments, he finds the military so interwoven with them
all, that they can not be thoroughly understood without it. In fine, he
will return with far less information, than with the aid of a military
education he might have derived. As it respects the military exercises,
I&nbsp;would observe, that were they of no other use than in preserving
the health of students, and confirming in them a good figure and
manliness of deportment, I&nbsp;should consider these were ample reasons
for introducing them into our seminaries generally; they are better
calculated than any others for counteracting the natural habits of
students, and can always be attended to, at such times as would
otherwise be spent in idleness or useless amusements. Having expressed
my views thus fully on this subject, I&nbsp;will next proceed to state
more specifically the other branches which I would propose to introduce
into a complete course of education: and&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The course of classical and scientific instruction should be as
extensive and perfect as at our most approved institutions. The students
should be earnestly enjoined and required to derive as much of useful
information from the most approved authors, as their time and
circumstances would permit.</p>

<p>2. A due portion of time should be devoted to practical geometrical
and other scientific operations in the field. The pupils should
frequently be taken on pedestrian excursions into the country; be
habituated to endure fatigue, to climb mountains, and to determine their
altitudes by means of the barometer as well as by trigonometry. Those
excursions, while they would learn them to walk, (which I estimate an
important part of education,) and render them vigorous and healthy,
would also prepare them for becoming men of practical science generally,
and would further confer on them a correct <i>coup d’œil</i> so
essentially
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page843" id = "page843">843</a></span>
necessary for military and civil engineers, for surveyors, for
travelers, &amp;c., and which can never be acquired otherwise than by
practice.</p>

<p>3. Another portion of their time should be devoted to practical
agricultural pursuits, gardening, &amp;c.</p>

<p>In a country like ours, which is emphatically agricultural,
I&nbsp;presume it will not be doubted, that a practical scientific
knowledge of agriculture would constitute an important appendage to the
education of every American citizen. Indeed the most certain mode of
improving the agriculture of the country will be to make it a branch of
elementary education. By these means, it will not only be improved, but
also a knowledge of their improvements generally disseminated amongst
the great mass of the people.</p>

<p>4. A further portion of time should be devoted to attending familiar
explanatory lectures on the various branches of military science, on the
principles and practice of agriculture, commerce and manufactures, on
political economy, on the constitution of the United States, and those
of the individual states, in which should be pointed out particularly
the powers and duties of the general <ins class = "correction" title =
"hyphen in ‘govern/ment’ missing at line break">government,</ins> and
the existing relations between that and the state governments, on the
science of government generally. In fine, on all those branches of
knowledge which are necessary to enable them to discharge, in the best
possible manner, the duties they owe to themselves, to their fellow men,
and to their country.</p>

<p>5. To the institution should be attached a range of mechanics’ shops,
where those who possess an aptitude and inclination might occasionally
employ a leisure hour in learning the use of tools and acquiring a
knowledge of some useful mechanic art.</p>

<p>The division of time, each day, I would make as follows,
viz.:&mdash;</p>

<p>Eight hours to be devoted to study and recitation; eight hours
allowed for sleep. Three hours for the regular meals, and such other
necessary personal duties as the student may require. Two hours for the
military and other exercises, fencing, &amp;c. The remaining three hours
to be devoted, in due proportion, to practical agricultural and
scientific pursuits and duties, and in attending lectures on the various
subjects before mentioned.</p>

<p>Some of the most prominent advantages of the foregoing plan would, in
my opinion, be the following; viz.:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The student would, in the time usually devoted to the acquirement
of elementary education, (say six years) acquire, at least, as much, and
I think I may venture to say more, of book knowledge, than he would
under the present system.</p>

<p>2. In addition to this, he would go into the world an accomplished
soldier, a scientific and practical agriculturist, an expert
mechanician, an intelligent merchant, a political economist, legislator
and statesman. In fine, he could hardly be placed in any situation, the
duties of which he would not be prepared to discharge with honor to
himself and advantage to his fellow-citizens and his country.</p>

<p>3. In addition to the foregoing, he would grow up with habits of
industry, economy and morality, and, what is of little less importance,
a firm and vigorous constitution; with a head to conceive and an arm to
execute&mdash;he would emphatically possess a sound mind in a sound
body.</p>
</div>

<p>After much correspondence Capt. Partridge decided to carry out his
principles of education in an institution organized on his own plan and
conducted by himself, with such assistance as he could command, in his
native village of Norwich, Vermont. Here he opened, on the 4th of
September, 1820, the American Literary, Scientific and Military Academy,
on which the pupils or their parents had their choice of studies, out of
a course as extensive as that of any academy and college in New England
combined&mdash;in which
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page844" id = "page844">844</a></span>
military training formed a prominent feature, and the mathematics,
especially as applied to surveying and engineering, received special
attention. During the four years and half of its continuance in Norwich
the Academy was attended by 480 pupils, representing twenty-one out of
the twenty-four states, and of these, and especially of such as
continued on an average two years at the institution, a large proportion
became distinguished in military, public, and business life&mdash;as
large it is believed as the records of any other institution for the
same period of time can show. Its success demonstrated beyond cavil,
that military exercises and duties are not inconsistent with ardent
devotion, and the highest attainments in literary and scientific
studies.</p>

<p>In 1824, the citizens of Middletown, Connecticut, made a liberal
subscription to secure the location there, of a college about to be
established in that State, under Episcopal auspices. Failing in that
object, by the location of the institution at Hartford, where it now
exists under the name of Trinity College, they invited Capt. Partridge
to remove his Academy to their city, and offered to erect and place at
his disposal suitable buildings for his accommodation. This invitation
and offer were accepted, and on the 1st of April, 1825, he closed his
institution at Norwich, and on the 1st of September following, opened
his new course of instruction at Middletown, with an attendance of two
hundred and ninety-seven pupils in the first year. During the three
years&mdash;up to September 1828, the American Literary, Scientific, and
Military Academy at Middletown remained under his superintendence, there
were nearly twelve hundred pupils representing every State and Territory
of the United States, the British Provinces, Mexico, several of the
South American States, and the West Indies. This attendance shows
conclusively, that the military and scientific element, together with an
optional course of study, and a term of residence limited by the ability
of the pupil to complete the course, met a want not provided for in
existing colleges. Of those who completed the full course of study begun
at Norwich, as large a proportion, as the corresponding graduates of any
American college, attained a high degree of usefulness and eminence in
widely diversified fields of labor. Among its graduates are to be found
the founders or professors of several State Military Institutes, many
officers of the highest rank in the military service of the United
States, several eminent civil engineers, superintendents, of railroads,
members of Congress, lawyers, and men of practical efficiency and
success in every line of business.</p>

<p>One of the characteristic features of Captain Partridge’s system
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page845" id = "page845">845</a></span>
of instruction and discipline at Middletown, was the military marches
and pedestrian excursions for scientific and recreating purposes
conducted under his personal command, or in his company. Several of
these excursions occupied three or four weeks, extending in one instance
to Washington. The military marches amounted in the aggregate to over
two thousand miles, and these and the various <ins class = "correction"
title = "text has ‘pedesterain’">pedestrian</ins> excursions, included
visits to nearly all points of military and historical interest in New
England and New York. The immediate and controlling reasons which
induced Capt. Partridge to leave Middletown, are not known to the writer
of this memoir. He has however, understood it was owing partly to a
desire for temporary relief from the cares and confinement of immediate
superintendence, that he might start a similar institution in the
neighborhood of New York, and partly from disgust at the refusal of the
Legislature of Connecticut in 1828, to grant to the institution at
Middletown, the usual privileges and powers of a college.</p>

<p>In 1833,1834, 1837, and 1839, Capt. Partridge was elected
representative from the town of Norwich, to the Legislature of Vermont,
and in that capacity labored to give efficiency to the military system
of the State. In 1834, he secured for certain petitioners a charter for
the Norwich University, in which the Trustees are required “to provide
for a constant course of instruction in military science and civil
engineering,” and are “prohibited from establishing any regulations of a
sectarian character, either in religion or politics.” Of this
corporation, consisting of twenty-five trustees, Capt. Partridge was a
member, and in organizing the institution in 1825, he was elected
president of the Faculty. He continued to instruct in his own department
of military science and engineering, and administered the affairs of the
university till 1844, when owing to some difficulties arising out of the
use of the building, arms, and accourtrements, which were his private
property, he resigned.</p>

<p>In 1838, he was influential in calling together a convention of
military officers and persons interested in giving greater efficiency to
the organization of the militia of the several states, to meet for
consultation. This convention met at Norwich on the 4th of July; and
continued to meet annually for many years, to discuss plans for the
organization and discipline of the militia, for the dissemination of a
knowledge of military science, for the defense of the coast, &amp;c.
Many reports of this body were drawn up by him, and the proceedings were
forwarded to, and printed by order of the Congress of the United
States.</p>

<p>In 1839, on the request of many influential citizens, he visited
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page846" id = "page846">846</a></span>
Portsmouth, Virginia, to establish a Military School, which he did, and
which was soon after recognized by the Legislature of the State as the
Virginia Literary, Scientific, and Military Institute, and aided by an
appropriation out of the Literary Fund. This Institute, with an
Institute of a similar character at Lexington, in the western part of
the State, has been greatly instrumental in diffusing widely in Virginia
a knowledge and taste for military affairs. The success of this
institution, and the personal influence of many of his own scholars at
Norwich and Middletown, led to the establishment of similar schools in
other southern states.</p>

<p>In May, 1842, Capt. Partridge accepted the position of Camp
Instructor for a large body of officers and men of the Pennsylvania
volunteer militia in encampment at Reading, Berks County. Each evening
he delivered a lecture to officers assembled in the General’s marquee,
and during the day exercised the troops in the manual of arms, and in
company, regimental, and brigade movements in the field. On this, and
many similar occasions, he demonstrated the correctness and
practicability of his theory of national defense, so far as testing the
qualifications of officers for command, and giving accuracy, rapidity,
and steadiness of exercise and movements to troops, by assembling
officers and men of the State Militia, once or twice in the year, in
convenient numbers and places, under instructors properly qualified for
the work. A&nbsp;few instructors, themselves trained in the best
military institutions, and familiar with every improvement in military
organization, equipment, and movement, and especially when clothed with
the reputation of success in actual service, would soon bring the entire
militia of the states into a uniform system, and give respectability and
efficiency to this department of the public service. This result would
be more speedily realized if a number of educational institutions
similar to those which he had organized under many disadvantages and
against many prejudices, could call out and cultivate military taste and
accomplishments among a portion of the young men of each state.</p>

<p>In 1853, he opened at Brandywine Springs, near Wilmington, in the
State of Delaware, another institution in which he fondly hoped his
ideal of a National school of education would be realized&mdash;an
institution in which physical training in connection with military
exercises and movements, should accompany the acquisition of practical
knowledge of the great principles of science that underlie all the arts
of peace and war, and resorted to by students from every state of the
American Union. His plan as developed in conversation with those
directly interested, embraced his old ideas of scientific,
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page847" id = "page847">847</a></span>
and literary studies with systematic pedestrian excursions,<a class =
"tag" name = "tag10_21" id = "tag10_21" href = "#note10_21">21</a> and
marches in vacations to the great objects of natural, economical, and
historical interest in different parts of the country. In this latter
particular, he unconsciously applied the suggestion of Milton in his
letter to Samuel Hartlib, that “the students of his Academy should go
out in companies with prudent and staid guides to all quarters of the
land, learning and observing all places of strength, and all commodities
(facilities) of building and of soil, for towns and tillage, harbors and
ports of trade,&mdash;even sometimes taking sea as far as to our navy to
learn there also, what they can in the practical knowledge of sailing
and sea-fight.” Arrangements were made for a class of ten or twelve of
the most advanced and matured cadets to accompany him to Europe to study
the strategy of the great battles of the world, and the armies,
armories, and resources of the great nations of Europe&mdash;thus again
realizing Milton’s plan of gratifying “the desire of the more hopeful
youth” “to see other countries at three or four and twenty years of age,
not to learn principles, but to enlarge experience and make wise
observation.” But these hopes were darkened for a time by a great
disaster, and soon extinguished in the sudden death of the great
projector. In the autumn of 1853, the buildings at Brandywine Springs,
were consumed by fire, and although arrangements were at once made to
secure suitable accommodations at Bristol, Pennsylvania, and upwards of
one hundred pupils enrolled their names to attend for a year at that
place, still the great motive power of the enterprise was stricken
down.</p>

<p>At the close of the year, 1853, Capt. Partridge returned to Norwich,
where his family still resided, in apparently good health and the best
spirits. A&nbsp;few days after he reached home, he was attacked by sharp
and excruciating pains in his back, which were soon subdued by anodynes,
but from the prostration and the cause, which proved on a post-mortem
examination to be an aneurism near the base of the spine, and which had
been exhausting his vitality for years&mdash;he never rallied, and on
the 17th of January, 1854, he breathed his last&mdash;widely and deeply
mourned by troops of friends, who loved and admired him as their
teacher, or looked up to him as the best expounder of principles of
military science and education, and of national defense.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page848" id = "page848">848</a></span>
<p>Although living most of his life in the discharge of educational and
public duties, under circumstances inconsistent with “a local
habitation,” he had strong domestic tastes and attachments, and was a
genial companion in his own room and home. In 1837, he married Miss
Swazey, the daughter of a merchant in Claremont, New Hampshire, and to
this happy union were born two children. The oldest boy, George, was
educated by the father on his own system, and had displayed vigorous
health, and strong partialities and attainments in mathematical studies
and their applications; but he survived his father only a few
months&mdash;“long desolate months they were to the widow and children
”&mdash;and the tenement of that bright intellect was laid by the side
of that of his hardy and indefatigable father in the little village
burying-ground. The other son Henry, as he grew up, showed a partiality
for the profession of law, and was pursuing his studies in Warren,
Penn., when the call of the President of the United States for
volunteers, summoned him to the defense of the flag of the country. He
enlisted for the war, and was promoted to a captaincy in a Pennsylvania
regiment, which was attached to the army of the Potomac, whose varying
fortunes he shared till, greatly weakened by exposure and disease, he
was honorably discharged from the service. His superior officer in
writing to his mother, says: “He is in every respect a model officer.
How could he be otherwise? He has it all by right of inheritance, and I
fully appreciate that you have made a very great contribution to the
government and the country in sending him forth to fight the battles
which have been forced upon us.”</p>

PARTRIDGE,</a></p>

<p class = "hanging"><i>Relating to the Military Academy at West Point,
and praying that young men educated at other military schools may have
an equal chance for admission to the army as those young men have who
are educated at West Point. January 21, 1841. Referred to the Committee
on Military Affairs.</i></p>

<p class = "hanging"><i>To the Honorable Congress of the United
States:</i>&mdash;The memorial of Alden Partridge, President of the
Norwich University, at Norwich, State of Vermont, respectfully
showeth:</p>

<p>That your memorialist holds it to be a cardinal principle of our
republican institutions, that stations of honor, trust, and emolument
should be equally open to all our citizens, to which all have an equal
right to aspire, and from which none can constitutionally be excluded by
any law, rule, or regulation whatever. Your memorialist has, however,
witnessed, with deep regret, a direct violation of this vital principle
of our constitution, by the rules and regulations adopted for the
organization and government of the Military Academy at West Point. The
cadets of that institution, all of whom are educated at the
<i>public</i> expense, have, for many years, <i>monopolized</i> nearly,
if not quite, all of the stations of honor, trust, and emolument, above
that of a non-commissioned officer, in the military establishment of the
United States, to the utter exclusion of those who are equally well
qualified, equally meritorious, and who are educated at their <i>own</i>
expense. But, in order to place this subject more clearly before your
honorable body, your memorialist would call your attention to the law of
the 29th of April, 1812, entitled, “An act making further provision for
the corps of engineers.” By the provisions of this act, no candidate can
be admitted into the Military Academy who is under fourteen, or over
twenty-one, years of age. The effect of this provision is to exclude
every young man in the United States who is above twenty-one years of
age from the appointment of cadet, while the rules of the War department
require that none except those educated at this academy can be
commissioned in the army of the United States. The effect, then, of the
law and regulation is to utterly exclude all the youth of our country,
except such select few as the President may think proper to place in
this “public charity school,” from the military service of their
country, who are above twenty-one years of age, unless they will enter
in the humble capacity of <i>privates</i> or <i>non-commissioned
officers</i>. And can such a system be in accordance with the principles
of our constitution? Your memorialist believes not. On
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page850" id = "page850">850</a></span>
the contrary, he feels confident in the assertion that it is a most
flagrant and palpable violation of them. The direct and certain effect
of this institution is to extend <i>Executive patronage</i>; for the
President has the entire selection of the <i>chosen two hundred</i> and
<i>fifty</i> who are to be placed in the institution, and also to
establish an <i>aristocracy</i> of the most dangerous kind, viz.: a
<i>military</i> aristocracy in the United States. What, your memorialist
would ask, is an aristocracy? Is it not where any particular class in a
State claims and exercises privileges of which the great body of the
people are deprived? And do not the cadets at West Point enjoy such
privileges? and if so, do they not constitute an aristocracy? Your
memorialist believes that neither the fact nor the inference can be
controverted. But your memorialist will go further, and aver that the
regulations at West Point have not only constituted an aristocracy in
the United States, but that this aristocracy has already become, in a
great degree, <i>hereditary</i>. How many individuals, your memoralist
would ask, who have held offices of honor, trust, or emolument, under
the Government, for the last twenty-five years, have had their sons,
brothers, nephews, or other relatives, educated at the public expense at
West Point, to the entire exclusion of those who (to&nbsp;say the
least,) were equally meritorious, and equally capable of rendering
service to the republic? And how many of those thus educated have ever
rendered any service whatever? A&nbsp;reference to the rolls of the
institution will answer these inquiries. Your memorialist has
<i>personal</i> knowledge of many instances. Your memorialist is well
aware that it has been attempted, by the friends of this monstrous
invasion of the rights of the people, to cast around it the mantle of
Mr. Jefferson. Your memorialist is ready to grant that the institution
was established during the early part of the first term of Mr.
Jefferson’s administration; but denies that any inference can be drawn
from that circumstance to sustain the present system. The institution
<i>then</i> consisted only of the corps of engineers, which was limited
to sixteen officers and four cadets, without any of those exclusive
privileges which have since been conferred upon it. On the 29th of
April, 1812, (just previous to the declaration of war,) a law was,
however, passed, entitled “An act making further provision for the corps
of engineers;” by the provisions of which, the whole number of cadets,
whether of infantry, artillery, or riflemen, was not to exceed two
hundred and fifty; and the President to appoint a limited number of
cadets, and conferring on him a <i>discretionary</i> power to attach
them to the Military Academy, was evidently induced by the certainty of
immediate war with Great Britain, and had a direct reference to a
<i>war</i> establishment. Your memorialist would respectfully call the
attention of your honorable body particularly to the provisions of the
law of 1812 just referred to; and, if he does not much mistake, it will
satisfactorily appear that the President is not <i>required</i>, but
simply authorized, to appoint a single cadet; and that it is left
entirely discretionary with him, after they are appointed, to attach
them to the Military Academy, or to attach them to their respective
companies, agreeably to the provisions of other laws then in existence.
And here your memorialist would observe that, in the
<i>peace</i>-establishment of the army previous to the late war, two
cadets were allowed to each company of artillery, light infantry, and
infantry, amounting, in the total, to a <i>larger</i> number than was
authorized by the law of 1812. But neither President Jefferson, nor
President Madison considered that the law required of them to fill those
vacancies so long as they considered their services were not required;
and they consequently
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page851" id = "page851">851</a></span>
did not fill them. The largest number of cadets ever in service at the
same time, previous to the late war, did not exceed forty, and seldom
exceeded twenty-five. Do the necessities of the country require that any
larger number should be retained in service now, than were deemed
necessary by Presidents Jefferson and Madison during a time of peace?
Your memorialist believes not. But it is urged, in favor of this
academy, that it presents a most favorable opportunity for the education
of meritorious young men who are poor, and, consequently, unable to
educate themselves. Your memorialist, however, has yet to learn by what
<i>constitutional</i> authority Congress is empowered to appropriate any
portion of the public revenue for the support of a <i>national charity
school</i> for the education of the poor. Besides, if this power did
exist, (which your memorialist presumes no reasonable person will
contend does,) <i>all</i> the poor in the United States have an equal
right to the benefits to be derived from its exercise, and that,
consequently, the institution at West Point is on quite too limited a
plan for the accomplishment of the contemplated object. Either, then,
the institution should be very much enlarged, or several others
established in different parts of the United States, which would be far
more convenient for the great body of the poor. If, however, the rolls
of this institution for the last twenty years be examined, it will be
found that many more of the <i>rich</i> and <i>influential</i> have been
educated there, than of the <i>poor</i>. Poverty, however meritorious
the subject of it may be, is but a sorry recommendation for admission to
this aristocratic establishment.</p>

<p>But it is further urged, that this institution is <i>necessary</i>
for the education of the officers of the army; and that, were it
abolished, the candidates for commissions would not be properly
qualified for the discharge of their duties as officers. Before your
memorialist proceeds to <ins class = "correction"
title = "text has ‘exaime’">examine</ins> the truth of this position, he would inquire, at
what institution, and at whose expense, Generals Washington, Greene,
Knox, Putnam, Lincoln, Sullivan, Morgan, Wayne, Sumter, Pickens, Marion,
and all the other officers of the revolutionary army, by whose valor,
skill, and patriotic exertions, these United States now constitute a
free and independent nation, received their education? The answer is
ready: at the ordinary institutions of the country, and at their
<i>own</i> expense; just as every <i>American citizen</i> should be
educated. And have the <i>proteges</i> of the West Point Academy, on
whose education so many millions of dollars of the peoples’ money have
been expended within the last twenty years, exhibited more skill, more
valor, or more patriotism, than did the officers of the revolutionary
army? Let the events of the Florida war, as compared with those of the
Revolution, answer the question. The truth is, (and it can not be much
longer concealed from the view of the people, by the reports of
<i>boards of visitors</i>,) that the whole system of education at West
Point is well calculated to form <i>military pedants</i> and <i>military
dandies</i>, but will never form <i>efficient soldiers</i>. Much more
important to them is their attention to the <i>cut</i> of the
<i>coat</i>, the placing of a <i>button</i>, and the <i>snowy whiteness
of gloves and pantaloons</i>, than to those <i>physical</i> and <i>moral
qualities</i> which are absolutely necessary to the correct and
efficient discharge of the active duties of the field.</p>

<p>But your memorialist denies the truth of the position, that the West
Point Academy is necessary for the education of young men for the army.
There are other institutions where military science and instruction
constitute a branch of education for the pupils. Of these institutions,
however, your memorialist will
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page852" id = "page852">852</a></span>
particularize but one&mdash;and that is the Norwich University, at
Norwich, Vermont, over which he has the honor to preside. This
institution was incorporated by the Legislature of Vermont, in November,
1834, with full power to confer diplomas, &amp;c. By the act of
incorporation, military science is made a part of the education of all
the pupils. They are consequently correctly and thoroughly instructed in
the theoretical part of military science, and also in the
<i>practical</i> duties of the soldier, and every one who graduates at
this institution is well qualified to discharge the duties of a company
officer (and even, if necessary, to command a battalion) in any corps of
the army. In order further to prepare them to discharge the more hardy
and active duties of the soldier, they occasionally perform military
marches. In the month of July, 1840, they performed a march, under the
personal command of your memorialist, to the celebrated <i>military
post</i> of Ticonderoga, carrying their arms, accoutrements, knapsacks,
&amp;c.; the whole length of which was one hundred and sixty-five miles.
Of this distance, one hundred and forty miles was on foot, and
twenty-five miles by steamboat. The march on foot was performed in a
little more than five days, crossing the Green Mountain range twice, and
the ground, with the heavens for covering, constituted their only
resting-place at night. The weather, during the whole march, was hot;
and they were enveloped in a cloud of dust, occasioned by the severe
drought, nearly the whole distance. They all returned in excellent
health and spirits. The youngest member of the corps was thirteen years
of age. The other branches of literature and science are attended to as
extensively, and the latter much more practically, than at any other
institution in the United States; and the students are consequently
equally well qualified to discharge their duties in the <i>cabinet</i>
and in the <i>field</i>. But notwithstanding the members of this
institution are, to say the least, as well qualified for commissions of
any grade, and in any corps of the army, as those of any other
institution in the country, and have also obtained the necessary
qualifications at their own expense, they are virtually excluded
therefrom by the <i>arbitrary</i> and <i>monopolizing</i> regulations
(established without the least sanction of law,) of the Military Academy
at West Point. In the month of September, 1840, a member of the Norwich
University, the son of a highly respectable gentleman in the city of New
York, well recommended, applied to the Secretary of War for a commission
in the army, but was informed that there were <i>no vacancies</i>, and
that the cadets from West Point were <i>more than sufficient to fill all
the vacancies</i>. On the 21st of December, 1840, your memorialist wrote
to the Secretary of War, recommending three young gentlemen, members of
the Norwich University, for commissions in the army of the United
States; and received an answer, dated War Department, December 29, 1840,
from which the following is an extract: “I&nbsp;acknowledge the receipt
of your letter of the 21st instant, recommending Messrs. Morris,
Stevens, and Dorne, for appointments in the army; and I have here to
inform you, in reply, that there being no vacancies at present, the
application will be filed for consideration, when any occur, <i>to which
they can be appointed</i>.” Now your memorialist feels confident that
the records of the War Department will show that a large number of
cadets at West Point are commissioned every year; and he presumes that
such will continue to be the case, unless a radical change is effected.
But when young gentlemen of equal respectability and attainments, who
have not been of the <i>favored few</i> whom <i>Executive favor</i> has
admitted into this nursery of aristocracy, to be educated
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page853" id = "page853">853</a></span>
at the expense of the honest working men of the country, become
applicants, their claims are entirely set aside. Against this
<i>unconstitutional</i>, <i>unequal</i>, and <i>monopolizing</i>
practice, your memorialist deems it his duty respectfully, but most
decidedly, to protest; and to ask of your honorable body the
establishment of some rule whereby the members of the Norwich
University, at least, (to&nbsp;whom, in many respects, he stands in the
relation of guardian,) may be restored to their <i>constitutional
rights</i>; that when they become applicants for stations of honor,
trust, or emolument, in the military service of their country, they
shall stand on terms of equality with the cadets at West Point.</p>

<p>Your memorialist deems it proper here to remark, that in October,
1840, he addressed a communication to the President of the United
States, on this subject, requesting to be informed whether, in the
opinion of the President, he possessed the power to remedy the grievance
of which your memorialist complains; and, if so, whether such power
would be exercised for that purpose. To this communication no answer has
been received. Your memorialist, availing himself of the privileges
granted to every American citizen, by the first amendment of the
constitution of the United States, would beg leave to call the attention
of your honorable body to some subjects, which he considers grievances
of a high order, and respectfully but earnestly solicits that they may
be redressed, viz:</p>

<p>1st. Your memorialist considers the Military Academy at West Point a
grievance. Under its present organization, it is unconstitutional,
calculated to foster a military aristocracy in the country; calculated
to depress the militia, (our only constitutional defense,) by engrossing
all the patronage of government; and is entirely unnecessary, as
military science can be attained at other institutions, from which the
necessary officers for the army can be supplied without any tax on the
people. Your memorialist, therefore, asks that this institution may be
abolished, and that the money that is annually appropriated for its
support may be applied to aid in disciplining the militia, and
disseminating military information amongst the people, who are its
constitutional and safe depositories.</p>

<p>2nd. Your memorialist considers the Board of Visitors that annually
assemble at West Point a grievance. This board never had any
<i>existence whatever in law</i>, but was established by Executive
usurpation; yet, to pay the expense of this illegal board, your
memorialist believes that more than fifty thousand dollars has been
drawn from the public treasury. Your memorialist earnestly solicits that
this appropriation, the making of which is a direct sanction to
Executive <i>usurpation</i>, should be discontinued.</p>

<p>3rd. Your memorialist considers the removal of the head-quarters of
the corps of engineers from West Point to Washington a grievance,
because it is a direct violation of the law of the 16th of March, 1802,
establishing that corps. That law requires the commandant of engineers
to reside at West Point, unless ordered, by the President of the United
States, on duty at some other place in the line of his profession; and,
when, at West Point, the law makes him superintendent of the Military
Academy; and when he is absent, the next in rank (who is then present,)
is made the <i>legal</i> superintendent. The appointment, therefore, of
any particular officer as permanent superintendent, is evidently
illegal, as the law has clearly specified who the superintendent shall
be.</p>

<p>All of which is respectfully submitted,</p>

<p class = "smallhead">REMARKS BY THE EDITOR.</p>

<p>We publish the foregoing Memorial of Capt. Partridge, asking Congress
to redress “the grievance” of the Military Academy, not because we have
the slightest sympathy with the object or main arguments of the
memorialist, but as specimens of the opinions held and propagated by a
graduate, professor, and superintendent of the Academy, who did more
than any other individual to introduce military instruction and
exercises in schools not national or professionally military. We can
not, however, put it forth without accompanying it with a few brief
remarks.</p>

<p>To Capt. Partridge, more than to any one man, and to his pupils, and
personal friends, as we believe, is due the popular objections which
prevail respecting the United States Military Academy, except so far as
the objections spring from the abuse of the mode of <ins class =
"correction" title = "text has ‘apppointing’">appointing</ins> Cadets.
For nearly twenty years Capt. Partridge was never known to express any
doubt of the constitutionality or usefulness of this institution. His
objections first took shape and utterance when he was superceded in the
superintendence by Colonel Sylvanus Thayer. Of the circumstances and
results of his removal, and of the appointment of Col. Thayer, and the
subsequent reorganization of the Academy, something has already been
said in the History of West Point, in this volume, (p.&nbsp;17-48,) and
more will be said when we come to speak of the labors of Col.
Thayer.</p>

<p>So far as these objections are directed to the constitutionality of
the laws for establishing the Cadet Corps, as distinct from any other
Corps of the army, or against training officers collected together and
organized as a school, we think them preëminently frivolous. If any
friend of the Academy would assure his doubtful faith in its
constitutionality, let him read Capt. Partridge’s Memorial, asking the
same Congress to establish a system of National Education, which he
petitions to redress the grievance of a special school, that every
civilized government holds to be indispensable to the right organization
of its armies.</p>

<p>So far as these objections are aimed at the mode of appointment and
promotion,&mdash;confining both to the patronage of one man in the
country, or one man in a Congressional District, acting in either case
without personal examination of the party to be admitted or promoted,
and excluding others, it may be, better qualified,&mdash;we hold them to
be valid. A&nbsp;more disgraceful record of failures, where an
opportunity of selecting the most meritorious candidates existed, can
not be shown.</p>

<p>While we believe that candidates are too often recommended and
nominated to the appointing power, from family and party considerations,
we have seen no reason to believe that the social condition or
occupation of parents has influenced the appointments. On the other
hand, the records of the Academy, as made out in this particular by the
Cadets themselves, exhibit a fair representation from all classes and
occupations of society.</p>

<p>According to an official Statement, prepared by Capt. Boynton, and
published in his History of the Academy, of <ins class = "correction"
title = "page damaged: number computed from table on page
799">5206</ins> cadets admitted from 1842 to 1863 inclusive, the fathers
of 1,300 were farmers or planters; of 681, were lawyers; of 672, were
merchants; of 377, were mechanics; of 69, were physicians; of 256, were
in the civil service; of 116, were clergymen; of 467, were in the army
or navy; of 572, were editors, masters of vessels, &amp;c. Of the whole
number, 1,136 were orphans, 1,585 were in moderate, 534 in reduced, 62
in indigent, and 324 in independent circumstances. We shall publish the
Statement in our next Number.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page855" id = "page855">855</a></span>
<p>The views presented in the memorial of Capt. Partridge in 1841, have
found advocates in and out of Congress before and since. They were
anticipated by the Secretary of War (John C. Calhoun), under whose
energetic administration of the Department in 1816, the Academy first
assumed the organization of an efficient military school&mdash;a place
of thorough scientific instruction in the knowledge not simply of
military drill, but of the duties of an accomplished artillerist and
military engineer; and they have been deepened by the radically vicious
system of appointment to cadetship, in which personal and political
considerations have in too many instances outweighed the merits of young
men, whose natural aptitude and generous ambition would have found here
the special field for their largest development and usefulness. These
views found expression in the elaborate speech of Franklin Pierce, then
a member of the House from New Hampshire, in the discussion of an
amendment to the <ins class = "correction"
title = "text has ‘apppropriation’">appropriation</ins> bill in 1836 (June&nbsp;30), who
“felt bound to oppose the bill in every stage of its
progress”&mdash;mainly on the ground that “the institution conferred
exclusive and gratuitous privileges.”</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>It is <i>gratuitous</i>, because those who are so fortunate as to
obtain admission there, receive their education without any obligation,
except such as a sense of honor may impose, to return, either by service
or otherwise, the slightest equivalent. It is exclusive, inasmuch as
only one youth out of a population of more than 47,000 can participate
in its advantages at the same time; and those who are successful, are
admitted at an age when their characters cannot have become developed,
and with very little knowledge of their adaptation, mental or physical,
for military life. The system disregards one of those great principles
which, carried into practice, contributed perhaps, more than any other,
to render the arms of Napoleon invincible for so many years. Who does
not perceive that it destroys the very life and spring of military ardor
and enthusiasm, by utterly foreclosing all hope of promotion to her
soldier and non-commissioned officer? However meritorious may be his
services, however pre-eminent may become his qualifications for command,
all are unavailing. The portcullis is dropped between him and
preferment, the wisdom of your laws having provided another criterion
than that of admitted courage and conduct, by which to determine who are
worthy of command. They have made an Academy, where a certain number of
young gentlemen are educated annually at the public expense, and to
which there is, in consequence, a general rush, not so much from
sentiments of patriotism, and a taste for military life, as from motives
less worthy&mdash;the avenue, and the only avenue, to rank in your
army.</p>

<p>I deny utterly the expediency and the right to educate at the public
expense, any number of young men who, on the completion of their
education, are not to form a portion of your military force, but to
return to the walks of private life. Such was never the operation of the
Military Academy until after the law of 1812; and the doctrine, so far
as I have been able to ascertain, was first formally announced by a
distinguished individual, at this time sufficiently jealous of the
exercise of executive patronage, and greatly alarmed by what he
conceives to be the tendencies of this Government to centralism and
consolidation. It may be found in the report of the Secretary of War,
communicated to Congress in 1819.</p>
</div>

<p>Mr. Pierce, afterwards President Pierce, quotes with approbation the
suggestion of Col. Williams in a report to Mr. Jefferson in
1808&mdash;that
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page856" id = "page856">856</a></span>
the plan should be large enough to take not only minor officers, “but
also any youth from any of the States who might wish for such an
education whether designed for the Army or Navy, or neither, and let
them be assessed to the value of their education, which might form a
fund for extra or contingent expenses.”</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>These are the true doctrines upon this subject; doctrines worthy of
the administration under which they were promulgated, and in accordance
with the views of statesmen in the earlier and purer days of the
Republic. Give to the officers of your army the highest advantages for
perfection in all the branches of military science, and let those
advantages be open to all in rotation, and under such terms and
regulations as shall be at once impartial toward the officers, and
advantageous to the service; but let all young gentlemen who have a
taste for military life, and desire to adopt arms as a profession,
prepare themselves for subordinate situations at their own expense, or
at the expense of their parents or guardians, in the same manner that
the youth of our country are qualified for the professions of civil
life.</p>

<p>I am far from desiring to see this country destitute of a Military
Academy; but I would have it a school of practice, and instruction, for
officers actually in the service of the United States; not an
institution for educating, gratuitously, young gentlemen, who, on the
completion of their term, or after a few months’ leave of absence,
resign their commissions, and return to the pursuits of civil life.</p>

<p>There has already been expended upon the institution more than three
millions, three hundred thousand dollars. Between 1815 and 1831,
thirteen hundred and eighteen students were admitted into the Academy;
and of all the cadets who were ever there, only two hundred and
sixty-five remained in the service at the end of 1830. Here are the
expenses you have incurred, and the products you have realized.</p>
</div>

<p>When the War of Secession broke out, and graduates of the Academy
then in the army,&mdash;like many other Southern men, in the civil
service of the United States, imbued with the political doctrines and
sympathizing with the domestic institution, on which the War was
based&mdash;sided with the political leaders of their several states,
the opposition to the institution took another direction. The record of
the War silenced these objectors. According to Gen. Cullum’s
<i>Biographical Register of the Graduates of the Military Academy</i>,
out of 1,249 graduates living at the beginning of the Rebellion, 99 in
civil life and 184 from the army, joined in the war against the United
States. Three-fourths remained faithful. Of 821 graduates in the Army at
the time, 184 (about one-fifth) joined in the Rebellion. Of the 99 in
civil life all but one were residents in slave territory. Of 350
graduates who were born in or appointed from slave States, 162 remained
loyal. Of the 292 loyal graduates in civil life, at the date of
secession, 115 re-entered the Army&mdash;all below the age of 45, except
those who were disabled for active duty, and most of these served in
civil capacities. One-fifth of all the graduates who served in the
battles of the Rebellion, one-fifth laid down their lives, and more than
one-half were wounded in defence of the flag.</p>

<p class = "smallhead">MILITARY EXERCISE, AND DUTIES.</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>The students will be regularly and correctly instructed in the
elementary school of the soldier, and also in those of the company and
battalion; they will likewise be taught the regular formation of
military parades, the turning off, mounting, and relieving guards and
sentinels; the duties of officers of the guard, officers of the day, and
adjutants; the making out correctly the different descriptions of
military reports; in fine, all the duties incident to the field or
garrison. The military exercises and duties will be so arranged as not
to occupy any of the time that would otherwise be devoted to study; they
will be attended to at those hours of the day which are generally passed
by students in idleness, or devoted to useless amusements, for which
they will be made a pleasing and healthful substitute. Practical
scientific operations will be frequently attended to, which will conduce
equally to health and improvement.</p>

<p>The students will be required to sleep on matrasses, or straw-beds;
no feather-beds will be allowed in the establishment.</p>

<p>For the purpose of giving to the students a military appearance, when
engaged on military duty, and also on a principle of economy, they are
required to wear a uniform dress, a description of which is hereunto
annexed. In prescribing a dress, it has been endeavored to combine as
far as possible, cheapness and a neat military appearance, with such a
form as, while it leaves the student the free and unrestrained use of
his limbs, will at the same time encumber him the least possible. The
discipline will be strict, but correct; and particular attention will be
given to the full development and due cultivation of all those liberal,
manly, noble and independent sentiments which ought to characterize
every American, whether citizen or soldier. The strictest attention will
be given to the health, manners and morals of the students. They will be
continually under the personal inspection of the superintendent, who
will bestow upon them all that care and attention which it is believed
their parents, under similar circumstances, would bestow.</p>

<p class = "smallhead">MILITARY LECTURES.</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>For the accommodation of gentlemen, (particularly of those holding
commissions in the volunteer corps and militia,) who may not wish to go
through with a regular course of military studies and instruction, and
also for the purpose of diffusing military science more generally, Capt.
Partridge will deliver annually at the before-mentioned seminary, three
courses of public lectures; the first course to commence on the second
Monday in May, the second course on the second Monday in July, and the
third course on the first Monday in October, annually. These lectures
will embrace the following branches of military science and instruction,
viz.:&mdash;</p>

<p>1st. Permanent and field fortification, the construction of field
works generally, and also of marine batteries.</p>

<p>2d. The attack and defense of fortified places.</p>

<p>3d. The use of artillery, with a general exposition of the principles
of gunnery.</p>

<p>4th. Military Tactics.</p>

<p>5th. Garrison and field service of troops, embracing particularly
their police and rules for turning off, mounting and relieving guards
and sentinels, and also for guard duty, likewise castrametation.</p>

<p>6th. General rules for the attack and defense of a province or
country embracing an exposition of the principles of base lines of
operation.</p>

<p>7th. Rules for the inspection and review of troops.</p>

<p>8th. A summary of ancient fortification, and also of the ancient
modes of attacking and defending fortified places.</p>

<p>9th. A summary of the ancient tactics, particularly those of the
Greeks and Romans.</p>

<p>10th. A description of some of the most celebrated battles and
sieges, both of ancient and modern times, for the purpose of practically
illustrating the principles explained in the lectures. In order to
render the lectures on fortification perfectly intelligible, plans will
be prepared, on which the several parts of a work will be clearly and
distinctly exhibited.</p>

<p>Particular attention will be given to a full explanation of all the
technical terms used in fortification, as well as in the other
departments of military science. A&nbsp;full course will comprise about
twenty lectures; five to be delivered in each week until the course be
finished. The terms for attending a course will be ten dollars.
Gentlemen subscribing for two courses, will be allowed ever after to
attend gratis. All those attending the lectures, will be entitled,
during the time of such attendance, to practical military instruction,
and also to the privilege of the reading-room, without any additional
charge.</p>

<p>On the 1st of April, 1825, Capt. Partridge was induced by liberal
overtures from citizens of Middletown, Conn., to leave his institution
at Norwich, and remove to Middletown, Conn., and reopen it in that city.
Before doing so he published a card in which he exhibits the progress
and results of his labors at Norwich.</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>This seminary was opened at Norwich, in the state of Vermont, on the
4th of September, 1820, under my immediate direction and
superintendence; and although the plan was new and untried, besides
containing principles, which were by many considered discordant with
each other, viz., the connecting of mental improvement with a regular
course of bodily exercise, and the full development of the physical
powers, the whole conducted under a military system of discipline; still
its success has exceeded, rather than fallen short, of my most sanguine
expectations.</p>

<p>The following extract from a recent report of the adjutant of the
institution, compiled from the rolls and other authentic documents, will
enable the public to form their conclusions, from facts on this
subject.</p>

<p>3dly. Of the above number, twenty are commissioned and warrant
officers of the U.S. Navy, viz., 4 lieutenants, 1 assistant-surgeon, and
15 midshipmen.</p>

<p>4thly. Out of the whole, 441 have been engaged in the study of the
Mathematics, and out of this number 145 have completed a full course of
“<i>Hutton’s Mathematics</i>.” Of these, 80 have, in addition, attended
to practical Mathematics, 56 have continued their course through the
study of Philosophy, and others are now fast progressing in the
accomplishment of those higher branches also.</p>

<p>5thly. The whole number who have studied the Greek and Latin
languages, is about 150. Of these, 25 have advanced far towards
completing a course, although none have gone entirely through. Of those
not included in the last-mentioned number, many have fitted for college,
or progressed still farther, and many are progressing. What is here
considered a course, is the same which is laid down in the prospectus,
which could be scarcely completed in the period since the establishment
of the institution.</p>

<p>6thly. The number of those who have attended to the French language,
is about 130. Twenty have become well acquainted with the
language&mdash;30 are very well advanced, and many of the remainder have
made respectable progress.</p>

<p>7thly. About ten or twelve of those who have been, or are now members
of the institution, have devoted considerable time and instruction of
the militia or volunteer corps, in this and various other sections of
the country, and many of them are still engaged in that useful
employment.</p>

<p>Of those who have been, or are now, engaged in the study of the Latin
and Greek languages, I&nbsp;flatter myself there are several who would
not suffer by a comparison with any of the same degree of advancement at
our older and most approved seminaries; and as a school of practical
science, I&nbsp;have little hesitation in asserting, that it is second
to none in our country. In confirmation of this assertion, I&nbsp;would
observe, that since the establishment of the seminary, my pupils, in
addition to their usual exercises in practical geometry, and many
operations of minor consequence, have executed, in a very handsome
manner, a profile of the country, exhibiting the perpendicular altitudes
of all the prominent points, above tide water, as determined by actual
observation, from the summit of Manchester mountain, in the state of
Vermont, to the summit of mount Washington, the highest elevation of the
White Mountains, in the state of New Hampshire, a distance of 165 miles.
They have also executed a similar profile from Norwich to Whitehall, in
the state of New York, a distance of sixty-eight miles, and
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page860" id = "page860">860</a></span>
have further executed a trigonometrical survey of the country around
Norwich, for a distance in some directions, of about twenty miles. This
survey was commenced, and has been prosecuted, in such a manner as to
serve as a basis for any further operations that may be thought
necessary. A&nbsp;handsome topographical plan of this survey is
finished.</p>

<p>In the department of French, it is believed, the pupils have made as
rapid progress as at any seminary in our country, and in Mineralogy,
Botany, &amp;c., although but recently commenced, there appears to be
much zeal, and a corresponding improvement, amongst the classes which
have attended, and those still attending, numbering about sixty.</p>

<p>Music and fencing have been attended by a large proportion of the
members, and with a progress highly creditable to them.</p>

<p>The military exercises and duties are common to all the cadets, and
it is believed very few have left the seminary, who were not competent
to instruct from the elementary drill of the soldier, to embrace the
school of the battalion, and who, in addition, did not possess a very
competent knowledge of the principles of the grand tactics, of the
elements of permanent and field fortification, of the principles of
gunnery, &amp;c. The beneficial effects of the regular system of
exercise and active duty, to which my pupils are subject, upon their
health, has been fully equal to my expectations. But one death has
happened at the institution, since its commencement; and this was a
youth who had just entered his name on the rolls, but was attacked by a
prevailing epidemic, of which he died, before commencing his studies or
regular duties. Several who joined the seminary feeble and debilitated,
have in a short time been entirely restored to vigorous health. Indeed,
such has been the result, I&nbsp;believe, without a single exception.
That a youth may, by means of a regular system of exercise, preserve all
his bodily activity and vigor, and at the same time apply himself most
assiduously to study, I&nbsp;have never had any doubts; but if I had,
the facts developed since the establishment of this seminary, would have
dispelled them. Many of my pupils, and those the closest applicants to
study, walk with facility forty miles per day. In the summer of 1823,
several of them left Norwich at day-break in the morning, walked to the
summit of Ascutney mountain, and returned to Norwich about 9 o’clock in
the evening of the same day&mdash;the whole distance forty-six miles:
which, considering the fatigue and difficulty of ascending and
descending the mountain, (upwards of 3,000 feet high,) may reasonably be
estimated as equivalent to sixty miles on the usual roads of the
country. They continued their regular studies and other duties the
following day. In September, 1823, a party of nearly thirty accompanied
me on a pedestrian tour to the summit of Manchester mountain, in the
state of Vermont, a large portion of whom traveled 150 miles in four
days, and on the fourth day one of the party, a youth of sixteen years
of age, walked by my side forty-five miles. On a recent excursion, to
the summit of the most elevated of the White Mountains, with a party of
fifty of my pupils, a large portion of them, on the last day, walked
forty-two miles. Belonging to this party, was a youth of but twelve
years of age, who walked the whole distance, (160 miles,) carrying his
knapsack, with clothes, &amp;c., and returned in perfect health.</p>

<p>Since the latter part of June, 1821, the cadets, as a military corps,
have executed, under my personal command, six military marches,
amounting, in the aggregate, to 637 miles. Different detachments from
the corps have also, within the same time, in addition to several of
minor importance, performed, under my personal direction, four
pedestrian excursions, for practical scientific purposes, amounting in
the aggregate to 684 miles, and which, added to the former, gives
637×684=1321 miles. To this may be added an excursion to the White
Mountains, whole distance 170 miles, by a party which I did not
accompany, and which will make the total distance traveled in those
marches and excursions, 1491 miles.</p>

<p>The foregoing facts are stated for the purpose of illustrating and
confirming the correctness of the opinion I have so often advanced in my
lectures on education, relative to the practicability, and even
facility, of combining the full development and perfection of the
physical powers of youth, with a due cultivation and improvement of the
mental faculties. Whether a young man, who enters on the grand theater
of active life, with a mind and body equally vigorous and improved, who,
while he has a head to conceive, possesses also an arm to execute, will
or will not possess advantages in the discharge of the various duties he
may be called upon to perform, over one, who has grown to the age of
manhood, puny and debilitated, destitute of physical energy, and
incapable of bodily exertion, I&nbsp;shall leave to the sound discretion
of the American people to decide.</p>

<p>As it respects the effect of the system on the morals of youth,
I&nbsp;would observe, that I feel confident no one has left the
institution worse than he joined it, and that I flatter myself, several
have, in this respect, been improved. Next after the influence of
religion, I&nbsp;consider habits of industry and economy as constituting
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page861" id = "page861">861</a></span>
the surest basis of morals amongst youth. To instill these into the
minds of my pupils, ever has, and ever will be, a leading object; and I
consequently shall imperatively require the strictest adherence to ail
the regulations bearing on those points, by all concerned. I&nbsp;would
therefore beg leave to assure the parents, guardians, and relatives of
my pupils, that the regulations prohibiting the cadets being furnished
with money, otherwise than by the superintendent, or by his express
permission, is to be taken in its literal meaning, (without exception,)
and must be adhered to under all circumstances; and that any deviation
from it will be followed by immediate dismission. I&nbsp;would much
prefer that the great body of my pupils should enter young, and grow up
under my system. The mind and body are then more susceptible of
improvement, than at a more advanced period. Few, if any, vicious habits
have then been formed, and the morals, under a strict and regular
discipline, may easily be preserved. It is my fixed determination not,
knowingly, to admit any young man of confirmed vicious or dissipated
habits into the institution. I&nbsp;would accordingly recommend to
parents and guardians not to send me any of this description; for if
they should gain admission, and did not immediately reform, (which
seldom occurs when the habits are confirmed,) it would only eventuate in
their dismission, and consequent disgrace. It is much easier to prevent
a youth from acquiring bad habits, than to correct them after they are
acquired. If parents and guardians will send me their sons and wards
free from habits of dissipation, immorality, and vice, I&nbsp;will
guarantee, as far as human agency will authorize, that they shall be
preserved free from such habits, while they remain under my care. Every
requisite means will be used to correct the foibles and faults
incidental to youth&mdash;to accomplish this object no pains will be
spared. With their foibles I will bear as much as any person, but with
their vices I will make no compromise. For the purpose of enabling me
the more readily and the more certainly to accomplish this important
object, I&nbsp;must request parents and guardians, if their sons or
wards have foibles or faults, frankly to state them to me. On this
subject there should be no reserve; as, with such information,
I&nbsp;should know much better what course to pursue with them.</p>
</div>

<p>The favorable view taken of the aims, progress, and results of the
scientific and military training provided by Capt. Partridge in his
Academy at Norwich, was amply justified by the success of his pupils at
Middletown, as practical men in various departments of business and
public life.</p>

<p>On account of the condition on which he held a portion of his
property at Norwich, Capt. Partridge was obliged to maintain there a
literary institution, after his removal to Middletown. When he
discontinued his labors at the latter place, and not succeeding in his
plans for establishing a scientific and military school in the
neighborhood of New York, he returned to Norwich, and in 1832, made
preparation to reëstablish his Academy on its old basis, and with
enlarged premises. With this view he erected the building known as the
North Barracks, which were occupied for two years by Rev. Amasa Buck,
for the purposes of a Methodist school, known as the Franklin
Seminary.</p>


<p class = "smallhead">NORWICH UNIVERSITY.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1834, a number of gentlemen associated to establish
at Norwich, not an academic, but a collegiate institution, after Capt.
Partridge’s views, and in the autumn of that year, obtained from the
Legislature of Vermont, a charter by which the petitioners were
constituted a Board of Trustees of an institution by the name of the
<i>Norwich University</i>. The charter further provides “that the said
Board shall be required to furnish at said institution constantly a
course of Military instruction, both theoretical and practical, and also
in Civil Engineering, and the practical sciences generally; and the
President of said institution, with the consent of the Trustees,
<i>shall have power to give and confer all such diplomas, degrees,
honors, or licenses, as are usually given or conferred in Colleges or
Universities</i>, at their discretion; provided, however, that in so
doing they shall have respect to the morals and merits of the candidate
alone.”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page862" id = "page862">862</a></span>
<p>This act of incorporation named fourteen gentlemen, and provided for
the election of eleven others, which twenty-five should constitute the
Board of Trustees of Norwich University. The first meeting of the
Trustees was held at Norwich, Vt., January, 1835. The vacancies in the
Board were then filled, and the first members of the Faculty were
elected, viz.:&mdash;<span class = "smallcaps">Alden Partridge</span>,
“President and Professor of Moral and Intellectual Philosophy, History,
Science of Government, Political Economy, and Military Science and
Tactics;” <span class = "smallcaps">Truman B. Ransom</span>,
Vice-President, and Professor of Natural and Experimental Philosophy,
Mathematics, Theoretical and Practical, and Civil Engineering; <span
class = "smallcaps">M. Noras</span>, Professor of Ancient and Modern
Languages; and <span class = "smallcaps">Franklin Marsh</span> and <span
class = "smallcaps">I.&nbsp;M. Horr</span>, assistants in the English
Department. These gentlemen were authorized to form a course of study
and laws for the government of the institution.</p>

<p>In May, 1835, the University was opened under the auspices and in the
buildings owned by Capt. Partridge, with a full course of literary,
scientific, and military studies. Among those enumerated in the first
prospectus were Military Law, Military Drawing, Civil and Military
Engineering. “Military Science being considered an important appendage
to the education of every American youth is taught theoretically in all
departments of the University. The military exercises are attended at
those hours of the day which are generally passed by students in
idleness or devoted to useless amusements, for which they will be made a
pleasing and healthful substitute.” “The discipline will be strict, but
correct; in principle, military. It will be a great and leading object
to instill into the minds of students liberality of sentiment and
principles of honorable integrity and attachment to our republican
institutions. Everything of a sectarian character in religion will be
entirely excluded and all literary honors will be conferred in
accordance with scholarship and moral worth alone.”</p>

<p>At the close of the academic year, 1835-6, (August 18, 1836,) the
first Annual Commencement took place, and the class of 1836 then
graduated, consisted of one person, Alonzo Jackman, now
Brigadier-General in Vermont, and Professor of Mathematics, Military
Science, etc., at the University. Professor Ransom, entered the United
States Navy about this time, and Mr. Jackman was appointed to fill the
vacant Professorship. Soon after this, Rev. Zerah Colburn, succeeded
Professor Noras. August 17, 1837, the second Annual Commencement was
held, and Hon. George McDuffie, of South Carolina, delivered the
address; the next year Robert Rantoul, Jr., of Massachusetts, was the
orator; in 1839, John Wentworth, of Illinois, and Thomas H. Seymour, of
Connecticut, were speakers; and in 1840, Benjamin F. Hallett, of Boston.
The catalogues of each of these years show that the number of students,
or cadets, averaged a little less than a hundred, and in all the
catalogues, the regulations for the Police of the Cadets’ Quarters were
given in full. They provided for all the military duties of the
students, for the wearing of uniform, etc., etc.</p>

<p>In July, 1840, the Corps of the University under the command of
Captain Partridge, performed a military march across the State to Fort
Ticonderoga. They were just a week on the excursion, and in that time,
they marched nearly a hundred and fifty miles on foot, about twenty-five
miles per day. Notwithstanding the excessive warmth of the day, and the
exposure to the air of the night, with no other covering than the
soldiers’ blanket, the Cadets all returned in good health and
spirits.</p>

<p>During the year 1843, several changes took place in the University.
From
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page863" id = "page863">863</a></span>
the time Mr. Ransom resigned the Vice-Presidency, until May, 1843, that
office was filled by Hon. Aaron Loveland. Mr. Ransom returned at this
time, and was again made Vice-President, and Professor of Civil and
Military Engineering, etc. The buildings and land used up to this time,
were the property of Capt. Partridge. During May, arrangements were made
for the purchase of this property by the University, but some
misunderstanding occurred before this was done, and in November,
President Partridge resigned, and took from the armory all the arms and
accoutrements, attempted to revive his old Academy in another part of
the village, and finally, when the University could not purchase his
property at his prices, obliged the students to remove from the
buildings. On his resignation, Truman B. Ransom was chosen President,
and for the two years the institution was carried on in other buildings
in the town. The Legislature was applied to, and appropriated a hundred
stand of arms, sets of accoutrements, etc., for the use of the students.
At last an arrangement was made with Capt. Partridge, for the purchase
of his property, and the University returned to its old quarters. The
number of students was small during these difficulties, but the military
department was always active, a good military education was given, and
men were graduated who now hold responsible places in the military
service of the United States among the Federal troops.</p>

<p>In May, 1847, President Ransom, then Major-General of the Vermont
Militia, resigned his place at the University, accepted that of Colonel
of the “New England regiment,” ninth infantry, and went with that body
to Mexico. September 13th of the same year, he was shot while gallantly
leading the charge of his regiment upon the fortifications of
Chapultepec. When Gen. Ransom left, Prof. James D. Butler was appointed
President <i>pro tem.</i>, and in January, 1848, Gen. Henry S. Wheaton,
of Massachusetts, was elected President, and served as such till August,
1849; he was succeeded in September, 1850, by Rev. Edward Bourns, LL.
D., who still (1863,) holds that office.</p>

<p>Soon after 1850, the opposition to anything of a military education
became very strong, the number of Cadets at this institution diminished,
and the tone of the prospectus changed to suit the public. “The
discipline is military in principle and form. The Cadets are under
military organization, they dress in uniform, are regularly drilled with
arms. But they are not made lovers of war! They are not found to adopt
the profession of arms more than others of the same age, however
educated; oftentimes the harmless practice of handling arms at this age,
is found to satisfy the craving for the use of them, and these young men
settle down into the ranks of peace more easily and more contentedly
than those that have had no such training. The drill is an agreeable
exercise. The system of discipline is strict, though not oppressive, its
sole object is to preserve order and promote study.” “The object is not
to make soldiers, but to strengthen the body.” During these years (from
1850 to 1860,) the prospects of the University were not bright. It was
at once engaged in lawsuits, and troubled with debt and opposition. In
1853, it was proposed to move the University to Montpelier, but the
project was finally abandoned, the last of the old Academy property was
bought, the buildings were repaired and the institution freed from debt.
Previous to 1850, the finances were in a very confused state. When the
charter was obtained, land to the value of fifteen hundred dollars was
brought and deeded to the University. The sale of this, and
subscriptions from Trustees and citizens of Norwich, produced enough to
purchase the North Barracks.
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page864" id = "page864">864</a></span>
The money received of students for tuition was always, and is still, all
used for paying the salaries of the instructors. The room-rents scarcely
paid the rent and repairs of the South Barracks, and the University ran
slightly into debt. The State, in 1853-4, gave the institution about
thirteen hundred dollars of an unappropriated school fund, and enough
more was raised by friends of the University to purchase the South
Barracks, and pay off old debts, and put all the buildings in good
repair. For several years it was obliged to struggle against a load of
popular prejudice on account of its military feature, but since 1861, it
has brushed up its uniform, and its Military Department no longer seeks
to hide itself. No such semi-apologies for the military training of its
students appear in its catalogues and prospectus for 1861 and 1862.</p>

<p>“The Norwich University differs from most colleges in two respects.
These are its double system of study, consisting in an Academic and a
Scientific course; and its department of Military Science. The Academic
course comprises those studies usually pursued in other colleges; the
Scientific embraces Mathematics, Natural Sciences, Belles-Lettres,
Surveying, and Engineering. Four years are required to complete the
former, and three, the latter course of study. Students are also allowed
to take a partial course in either department. The students of all
departments are regarded as equals.</p>

<p>“The feature, however, which more than any other distinguishes
Norwich University from other Collegiate institutions, is the department
of Military Science and Tactics.</p>

<p>“Agreeably to the provisions of its charter, the students are all
under Military discipline&mdash;are called Cadets&mdash;dress in
uniform, and are instructed in Infantry, Rifle, and Artillery Drill,
Bayonet Exercise, Fortification, Reconnoissance, Castrametation, Guard
and Out-Post duty, &amp;c., &amp;c. All the arms and equipments

<p>“The military feature of this institution is one which should
particularly commend it to the notice, and patronage of the public at
this time. The want of men skilled in Military Science and Tactics, to
take command of volunteer forces, and discipline them into effective
soldiers, has been severely felt in organizing the present army of the
United States. The reverses with which it has met are, without doubt,
owing largely to this cause. To guard against this defect in the future,
it is now generally felt that young men should be educated thoroughly in
every department of Military Science. In times of peace this knowledge
would not incapacitate men for nor interfere with any other
business;&mdash;while in times of war, it would become invaluable to the
country in training an army for efficient service.”</p>

<p class = "smallhead">INTRODUCTION.</p>

<p><span class = "firstword">In</span> all ages and in all countries
there have been educators who recognized the importance of the physical,
and more specifically, of the military element in their schemes of
individual and collective teaching. No higher authority in English
pedagogical literature of the liberal type, can be named in this
connection, than John Milton, who, in his brief but masterly outline of
“a virtuous and noble education,” includes this in the means of a
complete and generous culture, that is “to fit a man to perform justly,
skillfully, and magnanimously all the offices, both private and public,
of peace and war.” In the outset he demands that the number of pupils,
for whose accommodations a spacious house and grounds were to be
provided, should be large enough for “the convenience of a foot company
or interchangeably two troops of cavalry,” so that systematic exercise
could alternate with the studies and diet. In his general <ins class =
"correction" title = "text has ‘progamme’">programme</ins> he includes
studies which shall “stir up their spirits to manly and liberal
exercise,” and “inflame their hearts with high hopes of living to be
brave men and worthy patriots.” In the enumeration of studies he
specifies mathematics, the practical aid of instruments in surveying and
engineering, and their application to fortification and navigation.
Living in the midst of a civil war like our own, when the preservation
of constitutional liberty had summoned troops from the field, the shop,
and the study, and placed men in command who had not been trained to the
profession of arms, Milton directs or points out the value of studies,
the mastery of whose general principles “may at some time or other save
an <ins class = "correction"
title = "text has superfluous close quote">army,</ins> and not let the healthy and stout bodies of young men
rot away under them for want of this discipline, which is a great pity,
and no less shame to the commander.” In treating specially of physical
culture, Milton assigns to military drill, and use of sword and other
weapons, at least an hour and a half each day, that his pupils may be
equally good both for peace and war. “The exercise which I commend first
is the exact use of these weapons to guard and strike safely with edge
or point. This will keep them healthy, nimble, strong, and well in
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page866" id = "page866">866</a></span>
breath; is also the likeliest means to make them grow large and tall,
and to inspire them with a gallant and fearless courage, which being
tempered with seasonable lectures and precepts to make them of true
fortitude and patience, will turn into a native and heroic valor, and
makes them hate the cowardice of doing wrong.” With the use of the sword
Milton would associate all athletic sports “wherein Englishmen are apt
to excel.” And after the day’s study has been thoroughly done, “with
minds in good tune and satisfaction,” he would occupy the “two hours
before supper in military motions, under sky, or cover, according to the
season, as was the Roman wont; first on foot, then as their age permits,
on horseback to all the art of cavalry; that having in spirit, but with
much exactness and daily muster, served out the rudiments of their
soldiership in the skill of embattling, marching, encamping, fortifying,
besieging and battering, with all the helps of ancient and modern
strategems, tactics, and warlike maxims, they may, as it were, out of a
long war come forth renowned and perfect commanders in the service of
their country. They would not then if they were trusted with fair and
hopeful armies, suffer them for want of just and wise discipline to shed
away from about them like sick feathers, though they be never so oft
supplied; they would not suffer these empty and unrecruitable colonels
to quaff out or convey into secret hoards the wages of a delusive list
and miserable remnant. No, certainly, if they knew aught of that
knowledge which belongs to good men or good governors, they would not
suffer these things.” To these school studies and practical exercises,
Milton would add excursions “to all quarters of the land, learning and
observing all places of strength, all material for building, all soil
for towns and tillage, harbors and ports of trade. These ways would try
all their peculiar gifts of Nature, and if there is any secret
excellence among them, would fetch it out and give it fair opportunities
to advance itself by.”</p>

<p>The views of Milton in favor of military exercises can not be
attributed to any professional bias, for his tastes and his habits of
life were in the shaded walks of the academy, “contemplating the serene
countenance of truth in the still air of delightful study.”</p>

<p>The example of Switzerland can be cited on the side of their
practicality, on a scale as liberal and much more popular than their
author at the time contemplated; and quite recently (1871), the Federal
war authorities propose that the older boys in the secondary and
superior schools shall be instructed in outpost and skirmishing
duties.</p>

<span class = "submini">A NATIONAL NECESSITY</span></h3>

<p class = "smallhead">BY EDWARD L. MOLINEUX</p>

<p class = "heading">Major and Inspector in New York Militia.</p>

<p><span class = "firstword">From</span> a long and unexampled period of
political and commercial prosperity we suddenly find ourselves called
upon to struggle for national existence, and while a noble response from
the people to the necessity of the struggle has strengthened the hand of
government with an intelligent army, and developed the resources of the
country, yet the occasion has laid bare defects which call for
correction.</p>

<p>Without a standing army of any magnitude we have found our militia
laws defective, and have been obliged to create ourselves a military
people by the sufferings and bitterness of an experience bought on the
field of active warfare.</p>

<p>Military necessity has compelled the loss of invaluable time in the
organizing and preparing of our troops, which would not have been
required had we been able to meet the rebellion at the commencement with
well trained officers and an experienced and carefully drilled
militia.</p>

<p>“<i>The first object</i>” says Daniel Webster, “<i>of a free people
is the preservation of their liberty:</i>” a noble truth which must
speak home to the heart of every American, and if, as it is asserted,
“the future life and character of a nation is to be seen in its system
of schools,” then we may well listen with some degree of alarm to the
warnings and unmistakable evidences by which we are surrounded, that the
American race is physically deteriorating.<a class = "tag" name =
"tag10_22" id = "tag10_22" href = "#note10_22">22</a></p>

<p>The question arises, has our National system of Education been such
as to qualify and prepare us to maintain successfully, the noble
inheritance which was won by the physical energies of the men of the
Revolution, and with our success in the field of intellectual culture,
have we kept the physical advantages possessed by our forefathers?</p>

<p>Let us not mislead ourselves in this matter, but calmly look at the
facts, that as a rule, our present system of Public Education is devoted
<i>solely</i> to the mental and moral improvement of the scholars, and
that the encouragements and rewards held out by committees and teachers,
stimulate to the overexertion of the brain, and sacrifice in too many
instances, the health and growth of the body.</p>

<p>Although great improvement has been made of late by the shortening of
the time devoted to study, and by the introduction of more frequent
periods of recreation, yet still little has been attempted for giving
exercise and activity to the body; this important training being left to
the care of parents or the pupils themselves.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page868" id = "page868">868</a></span>
<p>Is it not too true that the increase of ill health, broken
constitutions, and early deaths, among the growing portion of our
population, especially in cities, warns us, year after year, that the
thirst for knowledge, and the restless seeking after mental and
intellectual improvement, have been bought at the expense of the vital
energies of the great body of youth who throng the colleges and public
schools of our land?<a class = "tag" name = "tag10_23" id = "tag10_23"
href = "#note10_23">23</a></p>

<p>If any one denies this, let him visit our institutions of learning,
and while he may well admire the wisdom and forethought which has
established our prosperity on a noble system of National Education, he
can not but notice the debility evinced in the frames of so many
youthful votaries of intellectual training; the exceptions making the
contrast still more strikingly painful. Then let him go to the
counting-house or the close confinement of some mechanical employment,
where the evils from mental activity, unaccompanied by physical
recreation, are yet more strongly developed. These evils assail not only
the happiness of families, but the prosperity of the nation and the
well-being of the race. Is this right or necessary? Can it be
avoided?</p>

<p>The solution of these momentous questions may well engage the serious
attention of the reflecting teacher, parent and patriot; and to them we
assert that, <i>unless physical exercises are enforced upon our system
of Public School education, our intellectual culture will be of little
avail, and that our nationality stands in danger of sinking a prey to
designing opponents</i>.</p>

<p>That enfeebled races are invariably conquered by those more
powerfully developed, is proved by innumerable instances in history.
That physical training was an important branch of education among the
Greeks and Romans, is well known. The system inculcated by the
iron-hearted Lycurgus, among the Spartan youth, was of a nature
admirably adapted to fit them for all the sterner realities of life,
whilst the athletic games and exercises of the youth of Rome,
comprising, as it did, walking, running, wrestling, swimming, and
military drill, were the means of improving, to the utmost, their
physical powers. Upon reaching manhood, the advantage of this training
was indicated by the robustness of form, and the constitutional vigor
which enabled them to undertake labor, fatigue and hardship of every
kind, with perfect indifference.</p>

<p>The Spartan and the Roman soldiers were by this early training, not
only qualified to surmount with ease the various obstacles and
difficulties incident to a state of active warfare, but they also became
gifted with precision and rapidity in every movement, and each man was
likewise endowed with that confidence in himself, and that unbounded
reliance upon order, subordination and combined action, which nourish
audacity, yet temper it with coolness and steadiness.</p>

<p>Unfortunately this system, by which the vigor and valor of a Spartan
or a Roman has passed into a proverb, fell into disuse, and as it was
neglected for more intellectual pursuits, so the grand empires founded
by its vigor crumbled before the assaults of more athletic
barbarians.</p>

<p>The influence of health upon the faculties of the mind is
acknowledged by all, and yet how few in this country devote attention to
those all important exercises which are necessary to the preservation of
health, and without which intellectual power can not be applied to its
highest use. The talents, the experience
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page869" id = "page869">869</a></span>
of our best educators of youth, are taxed to devise exercises to develop
the <i>mental</i> faculties, forgetting that too close application to
study is detrimental to the growth of the body.</p>

<p>But few thoughtful teachers will deny the extent to which this evil
has reached, or be unwilling that the strain upon the intellectual
powers of children, by absorbing studies, should be counteracted by
cheerful and relaxing exercises by which the mind will be relieved and
at the same time strengthened. The testimony of physicians, the valuable
works on health by Dr. Warren, Miss C.&nbsp;E. Beecher, and many other
able writers, furnish incontestable evidence of the necessity of
systematic exercise for children. To accomplish this it is absolutely
necessary to adopt it in our course of education, for in the majority of
cases it can not, or will not, be attended to at their homes.</p>

<p>What then is the most simple, feasible and useful plan to adopt for
physical exercises in our Colleges, Normal and Public Schools?</p>

<p>We unhesitatingly say, that the only successful, orderly, and
systematic method is, <i>to engraft them upon the course of studies
during school hours, and to carry it out under strict military
discipline</i>; the exercises being such as are best suited to the age,
strength and capabilities of the pupils, namely: calisthenics and
walking for the girls and younger children, and <i>military
exercises</i> for the elder boys.</p>

<p>Let not the kind hearted parent exclaim against his boy learning the
military drill, for fear of his acquiring a taste for warfare; or the
lover of peace imagine we would re-establish the stern laws of Lycurgus.
We would have moderation, in this respect as in mental studies, and
while we would not, as some may imagine, displace the bust of Howard in
our school rooms for a Napoleon, yet we would impress upon the minds of
boys the image and example of Washington, and in cultivating their
intellectual faculties, likewise prepare them in mind and body to
develop in manhood those virtues and powers which constitute a true and
noble citizen;&mdash;a sincere love of country, of national probity and
justice, beyond selfish considerations or personal aggrandizement They
should be brought up to a sense and knowledge that it will be their
honorable duty and privilege to protect their native land, that she
fosters and educates them in their youth, and that upon their manhood
her nationality depends.</p>

<p>We can never become an aggressive military people; the fields for
successful enterprise in art, science, commerce and agriculture, are too
broad and inviting to render military pursuits very attractive, and
unless we cultivate such exercises and discipline in youth, they will
be, as they have been, neglected when engaged in the active pursuits of
business. The clear, common sense of the American parent will
acknowledge, not only the national necessity, but the moral advantages
of this; for what fond mother is there but would prefer to see in her
son a manly, patriotic spirit, rather than a timid, mercenary one,
which, shunning danger, would sacrifice the honor and greatness of his
country to the base love of gain and ease.</p>

<p>We have suggested that the exercises be conducted under strict
military discipline, because it is impossible for a large body of
children to be exercised in the usual school limits, unless the greatest
decorum and order is observed; and if conducted under the supervision of
a teacher, dangers and accidents will be avoided, which always occur
when children are rash and thoughtless in attempting to accomplish too
much. Thus conducted, they will prove an
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page870" id = "page870">870</a></span>
invaluable aid to the teacher in the enforcement of discipline in the
school room, and teach that invaluable lesson which it seems so
difficult for children to learn,&mdash;unhesitating obedience.</p>

<p>For the advantages of this system let us examine the practical
testimony afforded in the European schools, where considerable attention
has been paid to this important matter.</p>

<p>On the continent the advantages of physical training are appreciated
to their fullest extent, especially in the Industrial Reform schools,
where the admirable principle has been adopted of teaching “what they
will have occasion to use when they become men,”<a class = "tag" name =
"tag10_24" id = "tag10_24" href = "#note10_24">24</a> and thus render
them useful members of society. To Dr. Barnard’s National Education in
Europe, we are indebted for the following extracts and illustrations of
this position.</p>

<p>In the Reform School of Rauhen Haus, near Hamburg, “they are taught
to develop their bodily and mental powers in various practical ways; to
use the fire engine, to swim, to save persons from drowning, and use
remedies to recover them, to climb a mast and handle the sail, of a
ship. They act as a jury among themselves. Their chief reward is to be
enrolled in the table of honor. In the great fire of Hamburg, their
conduct was physically, as well as morally, heroic, and while bravely
saving life and property, they steadily refused rewards.” Parents who,
perhaps justly owing to the numerous accidents in Gymnasiums, are timid
of their children becoming injured by these exercises, should carefully
read the system pursued in Fellenberg’s celebrated establishment at
Hofwyl. “A&nbsp;great variety of exercises of the body and the senses
are employed, so that every boy shall acquire a knowledge of his
physical strength, and attain confidence with regard to those efforts of
which he is capable, instead of that foolhardiness which endangers the
existence of many who have not learned to estimate their own powers
correctly.” At Ruysselde, Belgium, the following plan was pursued: In
summer, from 5½ to 6½ A.M., Exercises and Manœuvres; from 7½ to 8¾ P.M.,
Gymnastics. In winter, several hours were devoted to these exercises,
and the result found (as&nbsp;in this report,) was, that “rickets,
scrofula, want of elasticity in the limbs, difficulty of walking, all
rapidly disappeared under the drill, which confirmed the health and
increased the strength and activity of the children, and accustomed them
to discipline. It predisposed the pupils to sleep, and was an effective
safeguard against shameful habits and secret vices. The battalion
movements were performed with as much precision as that of the army, a
platoon armed with condemned carbines, marched at the head. The bayonet
exercises and skirmishing were as good as play to the boys.”
A&nbsp;remarkable instance of the moral effects of military discipline
upon the lads of the <i>Colonie Agricole</i>, at Mettray, is related by
M. Demetz, and was published in Barnard’s Journal, Vol. 1, p. 623.
“During the revolution of 1848, a band of workmen came to Mettray, with
flags flying and trumpets sounding, and meeting the youths returning,
tired from field labor, their pickaxes on their shoulders, thus
addressed them:&mdash;‘My boys, do not be such fools as to work any
longer. Bread is plentiful; it is ready for you without labor.’ The
<i>chef</i>, who was conducting the boys, and who behaved with the
greatest calmness and tact, immediately cried, ‘Halt! form in line,’ The
lads, being accustomed to march like soldiers, immediately formed. The
<i>chef</i> then
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page871" id = "page871">871</a></span>
said to the men, ‘My friends, you have learned to labor; you have a
right to rest; but leave these lads: let them learn now, and when their
turn comes they may rest as you do.’ The men gave way, the youths
marched home, and Mettray was saved,&mdash;saved, as I believe, by our
habit of military discipline.” It was the heroic exertions of these
young <i>colons</i> during the inundation of 1856, which won for them
the praises of all France. These instances might be multiplied, but are
sufficient to show the moral and physical benefits of military exercises
and discipline upon boys, even of the lowest class.</p>

<p>The governments of Europe being upheld by the bayonets of large
standing armies, and requiring, as they do, in many of the kingdoms, the
compulsory service of all young men, renders it unnecessary for the
daily public schools to teach military exercises to that extent, which
it is well for our Republican government to do. Yet in Europe they watch
with the greatest assiduity and care the bodily powers of the children,
knowing its great advantage not only in health, but the maintenance of
order.</p>

<p>In Great Britain much interest has of late been evinced on this
subject, and Mr. Edwin Chadwick becoming convinced that the studies and
confinement in their schools were generally prolonged beyond the powers
of the children, and in violation of the laws of health, devoted himself
to collecting testimony respecting the advantages of the military drill
upon the health of children. His investigations have elicited much
valuable information, the more interesting to us as they mark its
advantages to a nation which, like our own, depends for its defence
mainly upon a volunteer force.</p>

<p>The following synopsis of his pamphlet we extract from the N.Y.
Evening Post, November 1st:</p>

<p>Mr. Chadwick considers “In a sanitary point of view that a
systematized drill is good, and for defective constitutions requisite
for the correction of congenital bodily defects and taints, with which
the youth of a very large proportion of the population, especially among
the poorer town populations, are affected: and that for these purposes
the climbing of masts, and other operations of the naval drill, and
swimming, are valuable additions to the gymnastic exercises of the
military drill, and when properly taught are greatly liked by boys. From
a moral point of view, also, this drill will give the pupil an early
initiation into all the acquirements of discipline&mdash;namely, duty,
order, obedience to command, self-restraint, punctuality and
patience.”</p>

<p>The evidence furnished by English drill officers shows its national
value, and “That at school it maybe taught most economically, as not
interfering with productive labor, and that thirty or forty boys may be
taught the naval and military drill at one penny farthing (two and a
half cents) per week per head as cheaply as one man, and the whole
juvenile population may be drilled completely in the juvenile stage, as
economically as the small part of it now taught imperfectly on
recruiting or in the adult stage; and that, for teaching the drill, the
services of retired drill sergeants, and naval as well as military
officers and pensioners, may be had economically in every part of the
country.</p>

<p>That the middle and higher class schools should have, in addition to
the foot drill, the cavalry drill, which the parents of that class of
pupils may afford.</p>

<p>That the drill, when made generally prevalent, (without superseding,)
will eventually accomplish, in a wider and better manner, the objects of
volunteer corps and of yeomanry, which, as interrupting productive
occupations now
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page872" id = "page872">872</a></span>
becoming more absorbing, is highly expensive, rendering all volunteer
forces dependent in fitful zeal, and eventually comparatively
inefficient; that the juvenile drill, if made general, will accomplish
better the objects even of the militia; that the juvenile drill will
abate diffidence in military efficiency, and will spread a wide
predisposition to a better order of recruitment for the public service,
will tend to the improvement of the ranks of the regular forces, whether
naval or military, and will produce an immensely stronger and cheaper
defensive force than by the means at present in use or in public
view.</p>

<p>And, finally, that the means of producing this defensive force,
instead of being an expense, will be a gain to the productive powers and
value of the labors of the country.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant-General Shaw Kennedy, in a letter expressing his high
approval of the plan, states, “that the inferences drawn can not be <ins
class = "correction" title = "close quote missing">controverted.”</ins>
He is of opinion that if the measure is carried out it will be the means
of bringing two million of men actually under arms in Great Britain
alone, that is, excluding Ireland. He conceives that the effects of
military drill and exercises, and the use of fire-arms taught at
schools, would never be forgotten; that a youth so trained would, at any
future period, with a slight degree of practice, renew his knowledge of
what he had been <ins class = "correction"
title = "text has superfluous close quote">taught.</ins></p>

<p>Nor has the training of a better class of seamen been neglected. This
is of vital importance to the well-being of a commercial people, and it
is well for us to see what steps England is taking in the matter.</p>

<p><ins class = "correction"
title = "text has superfluous open quote">For</ins> the purpose of giving instruction in the naval drill,
old masts and tackle have been obtained for some of the training schools
in England, and Mr. Taffnell has received expressions of satisfaction
from naval men of the way in which some of the boys have by these means
been tutored as seamen in pauper schools. In order to form sailors, it
is necessary to have masts and sails rigged in the playground, and a
regular seaman must be engaged to drill the boys.</p>

<p>Mr. Baker has observed that the naval drill as given at Greenwich, is
highly effective. “He states that he was on board the Ganges and the
Conway at a time when many boys came on board who had been taught the
naval drill at Greenwich naval schools; and that they proved to be as
ready and well trained as man-of-war’s men; they were clean and orderly,
and as a class were first-rate seamen, becoming petty and warrant
officers in greater proportion than others.”</p>

<p>Of its consequence upon the national health and industry, <ins class
= "correction" title = "text has superfluous open quote">Professor</ins>
Owen has stated that even in the best-warmed and ventilated schools,
five or six hours’ enforced stillness of growing children is a violation
of the primary laws of physiology; whilst Miss Nightingale and others
agree that, under the present system, children are placed under
conditions which impair good bodily health and generate epidemic
disease. Mr. Rahnson, a school commissioner at Amsterdam, states that
the physical evils attendant upon the present amount of sedentary
confinement in schools, required from young children, is beginning to
attract attention in Holland, and that they have under trial a system of
exercises for schools advocated by Dr. Schrieber, of Leipsic. ‘The chief
question,’ says the latter gentleman, ‘is, How are our children to be
brought up? Is it according to the laws of nature? The answer is, No; or
we should not see so many children who were rosy and healthy before
going to school, become pale and bloodless after school has begun;’ and
he prescribes the limitation of the hours of school confinement.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page873" id = "page873">873</a></span>
<p>Mr. Robert Rawlinson, civil engineer, gives the following as his
opinion of the advantages of school drill in connexion with manual
labor:</p>

<p>“In my opinion, based on experience and observation, I think school
drilling and training would prove of the utmost consequence to the boys
in after life. I may give a few instances. In all engineering and
building, tradesmen are frequently required to use their strength in
concert, lifting, carrying and drawing; men, to use their joint strength
not only effectively but safely, must have confidence in each other. Two
trained men will lift and carry more easily and safely than four
untrained men. I&nbsp;have frequently seen trained men weed out
unskilled men where heavy lifting has been required, because they dare
not risk the danger arising from unskilled strength, and few have
performed with more safety work which would have been lighter and easier
if all had been equally skilled. Men frequently reject the assistance of
unskilled men, as there is absolutely danger in having them near.
Frequent accidents arise from using men unskilled in lifting, in
hoisting, and at capstan work. <span class = "emspace">&nbsp;***</span>
Boys should not only learn to march, but to lift, carry and pull in
concert. There are many necessary feats of strength in all trades, which
are more matters of knack and tact than of brute strength. Brute
strength frequently fails to do that which comparative weakness can
accomplish easily with skill and confident concert. There is no regular
system of training in concert to use human strength in the best manner
in any trade, so far as I know; acting in concert is a matter of
necessity, and practice gives facility and confidence. Drill and
training would probably double the effective human power of any
establishment, especially if numbers are instructed in joint feats of
strength. That which is taught to youth is never forgotten in after
life.”</p>

<p>“As regards its fitness as an appendage to the highest branches of
education, we have the testimony of experienced examiners at the
University of Oxford, England, who state that six hours mental work,
instead of ten or twelve, for adults, was the time of the great majority
of the prizemen; and it was always found that those who were the
foremost in mental labor were commonly the foremost in boat-rowing and
physical exercise. The Vice-Chancellor of Oxford testifies that the
institution of the systematized exercise of the volunteer drill in that
college had been attended by an improvement of the mental labors, and of
the whole of the order and discipline, as well as of the health of the
University; and that, encouraged by these results, he was considering of
making provision for cavalry exercises.”</p>

<p>Mr. Chadwick has also furnished incontestable proofs of the absolute
necessity of more active physical training for females and of its
bearing upon the future welfare of the race. But this subject has been
rendered so familiar to American readers by the able pen of Miss
Catherine E. Beecher, that we need not touch upon the European view,
except to say that the noble labors of Professors Ling and Branting, of
Sweden, have been ably seconded by very many of the governments of
Northern Europe, where a method of gymnastics for females, has been
systematized and practically adopted. From this brief sketch of the
practical working of physical military exercises in Europe, let us turn
to what has been accomplished among our own countrymen, whose activity
in behalf of public education called forth the compliment from Prof.
LeRoy, which we wish was better deserved, especially by the class which
he specifies.
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page874" id = "page874">874</a></span>
that “the improvement of schools is, so to speak, the fixed idea, the
constant preoccupation of the statesmen of America.”</p>

<p>We have indeed a noble and liberal system of education, but we would
see its fostering care so extended as to invigorate the bodies as well
as develop the mental faculties and intellectual powers of the pupils.
The military exercises would best accomplish this, and at the same time
form our public schools into a <span class = "smallroman">NURSERY FOR A

<p>Early in October last a communication was addressed by the writer to
the different governors, and various other persons connected with the
executive departments of the Northern States, in regard to the
advantages to be derived from the introduction of infantry drills in the
public schools, and by early preparation in school-days to strengthen
the <i>militia</i> of the different States. At the same time it was
placed before the New York and other City Boards of Education, and
referred by them to special committees. The subject was also agitated
through the columns of the daily press. The warm responses which have
been accorded to these communications, prove the deep interest which is
felt in this important matter, and it is to be hoped by the time this
article appears in print,<a class = "tag" name = "tag10_25" id =
"tag10_25" href = "#note10_25">25</a> some legislative action will have
been taken.</p>

<p>In New York, the energetic Judge Advocate General, William H. Anthon,
being engaged in a report upon the militia laws, and taking a warm
interest in all matters relative to the efficacy of the militia, thus
speaks of the importance of some alteration in the present system, in a
letter addressed to Mr. Curtis, President of the Board of Education in
the city of New York:</p>

<p>“The entire system, in my judgment, needs revision and reform, in
order to make the militia what the Father of the Republic intended it
should be.</p>

<p>It has been suggested by several persons, and among others Col.
Richard Delafield, U.S. A., and Maj. E.&nbsp;L. Molineux, that an
excellent foundation for an improved militia system would be the
introduction of ‘The Manual of Arms,’ and ‘The School of the Soldier and
of the Company,’ into our public schools.</p>

<p>I am disposed to consider these suggestions as valuable, and shall
feel obliged to you if you will, as early as may be convenient, inform
me how far you deem them practicable, and how they may be most
conveniently introduced into the institutions under the charge of your
Board.”</p>

<p>Mr. Curtis, whose personal observations on the European school
systems, and whose long experience at the head of the Educational Board
of the largest city in the Union, renders his views of the greatest
value, replied:</p>

<p>“It has been my opinion for years that military instruction should,
under certain restrictions, and to a certain extent, be given to the
older boys in all the schools and institutions that are supported or
draw funds from the public treasury. It is but just to the State whose
munificence sustains these schools, that the pupils should be instructed
in those branches of knowledge that will make them useful and effective
in defending and protecting the State. A&nbsp;well organized militia,
receiving from year to year into its ranks the disciplined and
instructed youth who have passed through the public schools, and to whom
the duties of the soldier are familiar, will always be sustained by the
public confidence and esteem.”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page875" id = "page875">875</a></span>
<p>Military discipline and exercises are by no means an untried
experiment in the annals of American education; some of our best private
schools and institutes having long since adopted it, and with a good
degree of success as it will be our endeavor now to show.</p>

<p>To the admirable regulations of our National Military and Naval
Academies, we need not refer; the systematic course pursued by them for
the development of health, for discipline of mind and body, being well
known to the majority of our readers.</p>

<p>One instance which came under the writer’s personal observation, will
sufficiently illustrate the dependence which can be placed upon
well-drilled boys in case of emergency.</p>

<p>In April last, when Washington was defenceless, Baltimore in riot,
and all Maryland in a state of revolt, communication being cut off at
Annapolis, there was great fear of attack upon that important
strategetic point. The pupils were prepared for any exigency, and slept
with their loaded rifles over their cots. At an alarm of a night attack,
there was no hesitation among those gallant little fellows. They were up
directly; fell in their ranks and off at a <i>double-quick</i> for the
point of danger, in an almost incredible short space of time. The elder
boys dragged their howitzer with them. Had an attack taken place, those
pupils would have given a good account of themselves and have stood
their ground with courage and steadiness. The secret of this is the
<i>discipline</i>, for which they are indebted to the assiduity of their
brave and experienced superintendent, Captain Blake of the Navy.</p>

<p>Let us read the opinion of this able officer in respect to the
applying of this <i>discipline</i> to public schools:</p>

<p>“My experience at this institution long since impressed me with the
importance of this subject, and I intended to have given my views
publicly, but you have left nothing more to be said upon it, and I can
only hope that those who have the control of our public schools will
view the subject as we do. We have received about a hundred and forty
acting midshipmen this year, some of them very young, and although they
have not been here two months, they present a beautiful example of such
results as the system would produce all over the country.”</p>

<p>It must be acknowledged that the States now in rebellion have devoted
much more attention to military instruction in special schools, than we
have, many of them pursuing the European plan of State Academies devoted
to military science. Thus while we have been obliged to <i>create</i>
officers from the small nucleus afforded us from West Point, they have
had the students from State Colleges to officer their regiments.</p>

<p>For a long time back Virginia has annually expended upon her Military
Institute nearly $50,000; South Carolina, $30,000; Kentucky and other
States have likewise institutions, founded in whole or part, upon a
military basis.</p>

<p>Although several attempts have been made to obtain legislative action
for similar institutes in the Northern States, they have not, up to the
present time, been successful, owing, we think, to the groundless
opinion that it would prove a heavy tax, without a corresponding
advantage. We shall endeavor to prove in this article how economically
an academy could be supported. It is, therefore, to private enterprise,
we are indebted for any experiments which have been made in this
respect.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page876" id = "page876">876</a></span>
<p>Several of our best boys’ boarding-schools in this portion of the
country, have for a long time employed a military instructor for the
pupils and been managed on a semi-military organization; they have been
well sustained by the patronage of the public. We instance two or three
schools of the present time.</p>

<p>Dr. Russell’s Collegiate and Commercial Institute of New Haven, is
one which has already been of national advantage to us, for according to
Prof. Daniel C. Gilman, “the scholars were of great service in drilling
the recruits of Connecticut at the outset of the war, and many of them
now hold important posts in the army. The scholars formerly trained as
infantry and are now at artillery practices.” Mr. Gilman very justly
observes, that in a country like ours with no standing army, every
able-bodied man should learn to bear arms, and there can be no cheaper
or efficient way of doing this than by teaching boys in schools.</p>

<p>The Eagleswood Collegiate and Military School, near Perth Amboy,
N.J., has been recently organized on the military plan. The scholars are
formed into a battalion under a superintendent and colonel commanding,
the rest of the officers being taken from the scholars. The State of New
Jersey has supplied the institute with arms, and the military
regulations apply to the conduct of the pupils in their general
deportment. The reasons given for employing this discipline are the same
that apply in every instance, that it is the most orderly and effective,
increases the energy, vigor and manly attitude of the boys, and induces
cheerful obedience.</p>

<p>To Major J. P. Prall, Military Instructor, we are under obligations
for the following account of Mr. Tracy’s <i>Military Boarding School, at
Tarrytown, N.Y.</i>:</p>

<p>“There is no question, in my mind, of the utility of military
instruction in schools, and if I had any doubts, they would speedily be
removed by the fact that the very exigency you propose to provide for is
being developed, only in a less degree, in the volunteer army now
fighting our country’s battles. There are a number holding honorable
positions in the army of the Potomac, and elsewhere, who have more
particularly come under my own observation, that have passed through a
course of similar instruction to what you propose, in private military
boarding schools, who give evidence of superior knowledge as soldiers,
and with a little preparation were <i>ready</i> to assume the duties and
responsibilities of the field and camp. They have more particularly
distinguished themselves as drill masters and thorough disciplinarians,
the very ground you proposed to cover in your articles in the N.Y.
Tribune of Nov. 20.&nbsp;I have especially noticed, of late, the
facility with which youth acquire military knowledge since the outbreak
of the rebellion, when the occasion seems to impress them more strongly
with its <ins class = "correction"
title = "expected close quote missing">importance.</ins></p>

<p>Independent of the military availability of youth thus instructed,
the promptness and precision that the system induces is apparent.
A&nbsp;simple sketch of the routine of duties in a school over the
military department of which I have the supervision, may give an idea of
its utility, as well as its usefulness. This department is conducted in
such a way as to make the military feature an auxiliary to the classical
and preparatory. Part of two days in each week is more especially
devoted to military drill and instruction, when the flag is raised on
the flag-staff on the parade ground with the roll of the drum, and the
sunrise gun is fired. At sunset it is lowered with the same ceremony by
a file of boys, in charge of an officer, or non-commissioned officer. On
other days of the week
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page877" id = "page877">877</a></span>
a drill of about an hour is held, in command of the company
officers,&mdash;always in presence of the Principal. The utmost
strictness is required in all the military features. The “Assembly,”
when beaten for drill or parade, occupies one
minute&mdash;<i>immediately</i> after, “<i>fall in</i>” is given by the
orderly, when <i>entire</i> silence is required. Boys being naturally
playful, much more care in these particulars is necessary than in grown
persons. <i>Tattoo</i> begins at 9 o’clock precisely, when the minute of
its duration expires every cadet is required to be in line for “roll
call,” and the three squads, each in charge of an officer, are marched
by flank to their quarters, (the whole not occupying more than two
minutes.) They halt opposite their beds, and salute their officer as he
passes out;&mdash;in five minutes the lights are extinguished. Their
clothing is uniformly arranged, and in such way that if called up at
night they can dress without lights and without loss of time. The
officer in command of each, being held responsible for the condition of
his squad. The military instructor inspects at unexpected times, and
directs the chiefs of squads to report the result to the officer of the
day, through whom all reports to the Principal must be made at 9 o’clock
A.M. each day. <ins class = "correction"
title = "text reads ‘Revielle’"><i>Reveille</i></ins> at day break, and they march by squads
to wash room, where twenty minutes is allowed for necessary ablutions,
blacking boots, &amp;c., and then the march to the Assembly-room for
“<i>roll call</i>.” Inspection of boots twice a week, at unknown
times.</p>

<p>The squads for the <i>mess-room</i> march in order, filing each side
of the tables, face inward, and “<i>sit down</i>” by command;
<i>rise</i>, march out and <i>break ranks</i>, observing the same
military precision. These various duties are performed with pleasure and
pride by the cadets, and the same promptness and regularity is apparent
in every movement.</p>

<p>The <i>armory</i> and arms are in charge of a detail of four, and are
inspected in turn on the roll, each week, and reports are made of
disabled pieces, and the general condition of the arms and armory, to
the officer of the day, and through him to the Principal. The various
reports are embodied into one, by this officer, so that the Principal is
not burdened with the details unless he calls for them.</p>

<p>Orders are issued from time to time, by the Military Instructor, and
engrossed in a book, which is open for inspection of visitors,
announcing promotions, results of inspection, and noting cases of
military merit and demerit, &amp;c. This has a tendency to stimulate to
exertion, and to efforts to avoid unfavorable notice.</p>

<p>Military classes 1st, 2d and 3d, graduated according to military
merit are established, and promotions to them made after strict
examinations. All company officers are selected from the 1st class.</p>

<p>A class of Honor, consisting of members of the First class who have
escaped being reported for disobedience and improper conduct, is also
formed. A&nbsp;given number of military demerits reduces a cadet, and
the badge which is worn on the left breast is taken from him. He may,
however, be reinstated.</p>

<p>Military demerits are punished by military penalties.</p>

<p>Cadets are taught to observe the position of the soldier when off
duty also; the benefit of this is very marked. When the machinery is
properly set in motion, the labor generally attending the minutiæ of
school duties is greatly reduced, and much more pleasantly and
thoroughly performed.</p>

<p>I have not entered into all the details, (and have given the military
only) but enough to give a general idea of the plan adopted by this
school. There are
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page878" id = "page878">878</a></span>
different modes in use in other schools. Some partaking more of the
military, and some less. I&nbsp;think there is danger, often, of <i>too
much</i> military being engrafted so as to make it burdensome; great
care should be taken in this particular, as the cadet wearies of it when
the novelty is <ins class = "correction"
title = "not an error: quotation began two pages earlier">past.”</ins></p>

<p>Mr. N. W. Taylor Root, in his admirable book on School Amusements,
furnishes practical testimony “that it fosters habits of promptness,
exactness, and unanimity of action; teaches implicit obedience to
commands, erectness of carriage, a neat and clean appearance, and a
gentlemanly and respectful behavior.”</p>

<p>It will thus be seen that a system of military drill has been tested
morally and physically, in private schools, and found of decided
advantage.</p>

<p>Why should these benefits be denied to the pupils of Public Day
Schools?</p>

<p>Why should this vast defensive power be lost to the Government?</p>

<p>As a national military necessity; as a protection to the health and
constitutional vigor of American youth; and as a powerful agent upon
their moral behavior, their energy, self-reliance and spirit of
enterprise, let <span class = "smallcaps">Physical training be engrafted
on the course of studies for all the pupils educated at the expense of
the State</span>. Let us not hesitate at the magnitude of the
undertaking, for it is a <i>necessity</i>, and under proper regulations
and restrictions can be successfully and economically accomplished.</p>

<p>The greatest difficulty to be surmounted is the successful working of
a system at once applicable to the requirements of a small district
school, with a limited number of scholars, attending only at certain
seasons of the year, and of those of the larger cities, with numerous
schools, in which a great number are under instruction.</p>

<p>Let us commence at the foundation, in the Primary Schools.</p>

<p>The moment the child enters the school care should be taken that the
mental exercises which are given should be relieved by frequent
intermissions for running and playing, under the supervision of the
teacher. This we are glad to say is the case in very many of our best
primary schools; but it is when the child becomes more advanced, when
there are lessons to commit to memory at home, that some simple physical
<i>exercises</i> should be taught him every day; exercises calculated to
develop the growth and expand the muscles. The calisthenics recommended
in Miss Beecher’s work are excellent, simple, and easily fitted to the
limits of the school house. The report of Mr. W.&nbsp;H. Wells,
Superintendent of Public Schools for Chicago, for 1860, gives some
interesting particulars of simple exercises which have been attempted in
that city.</p>

<p>There would be but little difficulty experienced in selecting
movements and gymnastics suitable for the strength and ability of the
classes of younger boys, and girls under instruction, provided the
method was established as an imperative duty which <i>must</i> be
regularly put in practice, and that no lack of interest on the part of
teachers, or laziness of the pupils would be accepted as an excuse for
non-compliance with the regulation. We trust if Physical Training is
carried out in our system of education, that a carefully prepared Manual
of all kinds of exercises, embracing the military drill, will be
compiled for the use of schools; in a word, a text-book to which our
teachers can turn with confidence to find exercises suitable for all
classes of pupils.<a class = "tag error " name = "tag10_26" id =
"tag10_26" href = "#note10_26"
title = "footnote tag missing: position conjectural">26</a></p>

<p>From the Girls and Primary, we pass to the Boys Grammar departments,
for
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page879" id = "page879">879</a></span>
which we propose military exercises, as being the most economical and
advantageous for public schools; for <i>tactics</i> manœuvre large
bodies in a small space, in an orderly manner, whereas gymnasiums are
too expensive, and can not be made large enough to accommodate many
scholars at once. This opens to us our most difficult, but at the same
time most useful, field for prompt and energetic action.</p>

<p>Suppose we take for an example one of our large cities. The lower and
female departments having simple physical exercises in use, it is wished
to introduce military exercises into the grammar schools. Let us see how
simply it can be organized, and how far it is possible to extend these
studies if desired.</p>

<p>The following interesting letter from the Mayor of Bangor, will show
the movement in that city, an example well worthy of being imitated.</p>

<p class = "rightside"><span class = "linegroup"><span class =
"smallcaps">City of Bangor</span>,<br>Mayor’s Office, Dec. 21st,
1861.</span><span class = "leftbracket">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Dear Sir</span>:&mdash;In reply to yours of
the 19th inst., I would say that, upon my recommendation, through a
communication I made to our City Council, on the first Monday of the
present month, an Order was passed directing the military drill to be
introduced into a portion of the Public Schools of this city.</p>

<p>I had given the subject some thought and investigation, and was
prepared to recommend the adoption of the drill for the physical
training, no less than for the military instruction it might impart. The
prevalent idea that education consists in training the intellect only,
is gradually becoming superseded by the more rational theory that true
education consists in training the moral and physical, no less than the
intellectual faculties.</p>

<p>For the physical training of boys, I think the military drill has
much to recommend it besides the military instruction it imparts. It
will tend to give them a better command of their muscles, and impart a
manly gait and bearing. It will also, if properly conducted, teach them
self-control, and give them true ideas of order, discipline, and
subordination, and whilst it will relieve them from the monotony of
their ordinary studies will, by a grateful change, enable them to return
to them with renewed interest.</p>

<p>We are entering upon the new experiment with caution, and have
commenced by devoting an hour, twice a week, to the drill. We began in
the school rooms, but found, after a few lessons, that the space these
afforded was too small, and for the present shall use the large
Gymnasium Hall. In summer, the grounds in connection with our school
houses may be found well adapted for the purpose.</p>

<p>The boys, with scarcely an exception, manifest much interest in their
drills, and receive the instruction much more readily than men. Two or
three of our public spirited citizens, well qualified for instructors,
have generously consented to devote the necessary time for drilling the
boys, for the present winter, without compensation.</p>

<p>Some of our teachers are also disposed to qualify themselves for
drill masters, and we are thus enabled to try the experiment without
much expense.</p>

<p>I have had no communication with Gov. Washburn in relation to this
subject, and was quite unaware of your interest in the matter.
I&nbsp;however noticed the article in regard to it in the Evening Post
of Nov. 8th, and was gratified with the important facts which it
contained. I&nbsp;shall be glad to receive any further
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page880" id = "page880">880</a></span>
communication you may make to the public on this important subject, and
should you wish, will be pleased to communicate to you the further
progress of our experiments.</p>

<p class = "center">Yours respectfully,</p>

<p class = "rightside">ISAIAH STETSON, Mayor</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Edward L. Molineux</span>, Esq., New
York.</p>

<p>To establish thoroughly and economically this military culture, the
Board of Education should appoint some competent person as Chief of the
Staff to organize and carry out a system of instruction and drill; he to
have under him two or three assistant instructors of experience, under
whose guidance <i>a teacher, or teachers from each school</i>, should be
fully instructed in the tactics, so as to be able to superintend the
drill of the boys, which should always take place during school hours,
and thereby form a recreation from mental study, and not encroach upon
their play time. These are the only persons connected with the
department beyond the scholars themselves, as it should be managed on
the principle of obtaining <i>the whole working force</i> of the
military organization from among the pupils.</p>

<p>The grammar department of each school should be formed into a
company, or where the size of the school rendered it necessary, two
companies: the officers to be selected from the most deserving and
competent boys.</p>

<p>The officers thus selected to be instructed theoretically and
practically by extra drills, in their respective duties. This would not
occupy much time, and any boy objecting to devote this time would not be
worthy of holding his position, and should be replaced by some one more
deserving. Every school should possess within its limits space for a
parade ground and for a few simple fixtures for gymnastic exercises. In
stormy weather the exercises could be carried on indoors; for the drill
possesses the advantage of affording exercise to a great number in a
<i>small</i> space without disturbance and noise.</p>

<p>No uniform would be required, and the only expense would be the loan
or purchase of 500 or 1000 short muskets, which could be used in turn at
the different schools for drill or parade. A&nbsp;simple musket can be
manufactured very cheaply, which will answer for all purposes.</p>

<p>The care and cleaning of the arms, the escorting and carrying them
from school to school, or point to point, as required, should be the
military duty of the pupils; thus expense will be saved, and the duty of
prudent soldiers to take care of their equipments and do their own work
inculcated.</p>

<p>These different school drills, always in charge of the teachers,
should be visited in turn by the instructors, who would exercise a close
and careful supervision over them.</p>

<p>Every ten companies or schools should be formed into a regiment,
officered by those selected as the most capable, and who had passed the
necessary examination.</p>

<p>Occasionally on Saturdays the regiments, in rotation, should be
exercised by the instructors, in battalion movements, field manœuvres,
skirmish drills, camp duties, &amp;c. These Saturday exercises should
not be compulsory, but would be eagerly looked for by the boys as an
amusement.</p>

<p>In the proper seasons they could be marched to the suburbs for their
exercises, and thus a pleasant holiday, with healthy amusements, be
given them under
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page881" id = "page881">881</a></span>
proper guidance. Any father will appreciate the advantages of such
exercises and enjoyment to his boys.</p>

<p>In the summer season it should be found out which of the boys could
not swim, and had no parents able to teach them. All such should be
classed together, and means taken to instruct them in this most
requisite art.</p>

<p>If found desirable to teach them to move together in <i>large
masses</i>, (in&nbsp;which our militia are certainly deficient,) it can
be accomplished by organizing two, three, or more regiments, into a
brigade, to be commanded by the chief instructor, he selecting for his
<i>staff</i> the most intelligent of the scholars who could relieve him
of much of the labor which the systematic working of this large military
department would render necessary. Thus those assigned to the staff
would be learning the technicalities of the department and the duties of
aids, secretaries, &amp;c.</p>

<p>These staff officers, and any other of the pupils who showed a
decided talent, should be assisted in acquiring knowledge in the
military science by means of lectures, &amp;c., from the chief
instructor. An orderly system once organized, with the incentive to
improvement by promotion for correct deportment, and of military
disgrace for ungentlemanly and unsoldierly conduct, would soon render
this military instruction of great assistance to <i>teachers in the
schools</i>. Let the boys understand that disobedience or improper
behavior debarred them from military honors and the whole tone of their
conduct would be improved.</p>

<p>Of the exigencies of this war, if complicated by foreign
interference, it is impossible to foresee, but every one is aware of the
importance of early training upon the destinies of nations, and but few
will deny the value of a well-trained battalion of selected elder boys,
in case of <span class = "smallroman">INVASION</span> or trouble, by
their relieving the fatigue of regular troops in mounting guard at the
least exposed positions, at the camps, on baggage, or for convoys;
likewise to act as drill-masters for the recruits.</p>

<p>The above plan, which was submitted to several Boards of Education
last fall, was offered as being the best adapted for <i>immediate
use</i>, and is therefore provided for the instruction of the
<i>teachers</i>. If, however, the <i>Normal Schools and Colleges</i>
would provide systematically for this instruction, it would be far
better as they are the proper fields for <i>permanent benefit</i>, as
each graduate would there become fully prepared to instruct in these
exercises in the public schools.</p>

<p>The views of the Hon. Joseph White, of Massachusetts, respecting
military studies in colleges, are well worth noting. He says, “let the
drill be regular and compulsory, taking the place of the very irregular
and insufficient physical exercises now taken, and our colleges would be
vastly improved in their educational power, and the commonwealth would
in a short time have a numerous body of educated men well skilled in the
military science and art, who will become teachers in our lower grades
of schools and in our military companies and associations, and be
competent when the alarm is sounded, to lead our citizen soldiers to the
field.” New Jersey has just offered a noble example by making an
appropriation for military instruction in her State Normal School.</p>

<p>But we must look at the practical working of physical and military
training in small district schools. Of necessity they are far behind, in
intellectual culture, those in the cities, and owing to the small and
uncertain attendance, physical and military drill would also have to be
simplified. The duties of a country
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page882" id = "page882">882</a></span>
life are such as not to render these exercises so necessary on the score
of health, nor are the pupils wearied by such constant application to
study. But how beneficial it would be in smoothing the rough, clownish
manners of the country pupil by teaching him the <i>position of a
soldier</i>, and correct <i>walking</i>. In respect to this, it should
be the duty of the trustees to see that the drill was taught as far as
practicable to the boys (calisthenics to the girls) by the teacher
himself, who, if he were not already instructed from a Normal School,
would find but little difficulty in mastering the details of tactics
sufficiently for his purposes. With as small a number as twelve boys,
company and skirmish drills could be taught; the latter is admirably
suited for country schools, and would be a delight to the boys. If near
the water they should be taught to swim.</p>

<p>It is thus we would teach our public school boys when they reach a
certain age, to act together as citizen soldiers and be prepared when
called upon, to do yeomen service in the country; to make it their pride
as well as their duty, to defend the Country and State which so
liberally educates them, let us cultivate in them a lofty and noble
patriotism, which shall have its effect upon future generations, for it
is upon these qualities, their intelligence and enterprise, aided by
<i>physical strength and health</i>, that the <span class =
"smallcaps">Future</span> of our country depends.</p>

<p>Although a course of military training in the public schools would
soon furnish our State with an intelligent class of soldiers and line
officers, yet the <i>art</i> of war in many of its branches, such as
artillery, engineering, &amp;c., requires a scientific education, which
can not be given in a private institution. Our colleges undoubtedly
could, to a certain degree, supply this want. New York city possesses in
its Free Academy a college which needs but the addition of two or three
professorships to carry out in part this requirement, yet a <i>State
Military and Scientific</i> College seems a necessity to which early
attention should be given, but to prevent its becoming a tax upon the
State, it should be managed somewhat upon the plan of the Polytechnic of
France, namely, that pupils at large may be admitted upon passing an
examination and paying the annual fee.</p>

<p>Offer inducements in the way of superior education and careful
training, and sufficient income would be received from the <i>paying</i>
scholars to cover the expense to the State. Thus, from this college,
might annually graduate men educated for the most scientific and
skillful pursuits of life, and who, in time of war, would richly repay
the State for the care devoted to their culture.</p>

<p>As an incentive to the public-school boys, several of the most
deserving should annually be sent to this college by the State, and to
the National Military and Naval Academies.</p>

<p>There is yet another important matter to be considered in physical
exercises for public education, more particularly in sea ports, viz.,
<i>Naval Training</i>.</p>

<p>A late report of the Shipmaster’s Association has shown us that the
reputation of our American vessels is deteriorating so rapidly, that
unless something is done, quickly and effectually, to provide a remedy,
foreign vessels will supersede ours in freighting. The necessities of
our navy are too well known to need notice here, and surely these evils
which assail the country at this trying moment of peril, should arrest
attention.</p>

<p>In large seaboard cities the naval training school, which has worked
so advantageously in England and Belgium, could be established very
economically by the fitting up of some hall, at a slight expense, with
spars, sails, &amp;c. Here of an <i>evening</i>, lectures and classes
for instruction in navigation and seamanship
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page883" id = "page883">883</a></span>
could be formed. This would be the means of improving our sailors and of
forming useful citizens from those who now idle away their time around
the streets and docks. The expense would be but light, and the
advantages obvious to our merchant marine and navy. This would soon
improve our class of sailors and officers, reduce the rate of insurance
upon American vessels, and relieve us from the stain which is being cast
upon us as a commercial and naval power.</p>

<p>The evening schools of New York city cost $73,000 per annum; a small
per centage of this sum would place in successful operation an
<i>evening nautical</i> school, which would enable, in less than three
months, American sailor boys to acquire sufficient knowledge of
navigation to aspire to the quarter deck. The handling of heavy guns and
the principles of naval gunnery could also be taught. If a war with
Great Britain breaks out, are we to be found slumbering in this respect,
and must we wait for the <i>first gun</i> before taking active
measures!</p>

<p>We are a peace-loving and domestic people, and we have indulged in
the delusive fancy that peace was to shine over us forever, until rudely
awakened from our dreams by a formidable attack at the very foundation
of our nationality. Every family circle is represented in that mighty
army which is battling for the Union, and we know that much of the
suffering caused to our brothers by this new and unexpected calling, is
due to the defects of their physical education, and to the want of a
sufficient number of well trained officers. But the war is upon us and
we must meet it as may best become a free nation and be better prepared
for the future.</p>

<p>It is the proud boast of England that in time of war she is “Ready,
aye Ready,” but a much prouder and nobler cry for us would be, the
prompt “Here” at the roll-call of our militia when summoned, like the
minute men of the Revolution, to the defense of the country. We want no
large standing army. In times of peace let our merchants, artisans,
farmers, and mechanics, enrich and develop the resources of the country.
It needs their industry and will amply repay their toil. But let them be
trained and educated from school-days to their military duties, and at
the first note of war let that response of “Here” come cheerfully from
our rich prairie lands, from our counting-houses, from our machine
shops, from the decks of far off vessels and from our public
schools,&mdash;one mighty cry of <span class = "smallroman">POWER</span>
and <span class = "smallroman">SELF-RELIANCE</span> from a noble
militia, possessing a thorough <i>knowledge of its duties</i>;
intelligent and earnest in the right; patriotic and strong in its
devotion to freedom.</p>

<p>A few words to those who fear the tendency of these exercises to
instil a warlike and blood-thirsty spirit, and we will close. To them we
say, we would emulate the ancients only so far as we can obtain from
them some of their earlier and nobler traits of patriotism, courage,
strength, endurance, and health. Let us picture what effect this
training would have upon individual character.</p>

<p>Let us take the example of a young lad, entering the public school in
the primary department, with perhaps a sickly, indolent disposition, and
somewhat careless and slovenly in his appearance.</p>

<p>We know very well from the present system of studies, that his mind
will be well cared for, and therefore pass to the effect of the physical
training upon him.</p>

<p>The first lesson then is to stand in an erect and commanding
attitude, with his chest well expanded, then his careless, slouching
steps, with hanging head,
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page884" id = "page884">884</a></span>
are soon changed to the brisk, smart <i>walk</i> of a young gentleman,
Calisthenics and exercises proportionate to his strength, and tending to
develop his limbs very soon improve his health and impart a youthful
vigor and energetic purpose to his motions, which are so much to be
admired in young lads and give such rich promise of the future manhood.
He soon learns exact and unhesitating obedience, and is taught by
precept and example, that no small advantage in appearance is to be
derived from a clean face and well brushed clothes. Is it to be denied
that he thus learns habits of order, activity and cleanliness which will
be invaluable to him in after years?</p>

<p>But his greatest ambition, the goal of all his hopes,&mdash;the
reward for which he studies diligently, is active and neat in his
deportment, docile and obedient to his teachers,&mdash;is to be promoted
to the grammar department or higher classes, where the boys have
military exercises. He looks with longing eyes at their neat, orderly
ranks, as they form for drill or parade; their brightly polished shoes,
neatly brushed clothes and well kept arms. All this is something to look
forward to, and when he has accomplished it, has he not to strive by
activity to win his <i>grade</i> and by self-control and obedience prove
himself deserving to command others? Manhood, when it arrives, finds him
bright, active, self-reliant and ready to become a public spirited
member of society.</p>

<p>Let the necessity of military exercises be placed before the boy in a
patriotic light and it will induce him not only to take greater care in
the execution, but likewise implant a still greater love of country from
the very knowledge that some day he may be of use to her,&mdash;of use
to her in the pulpit, in the legislative forum, in the busy pursuits of
industry and the various walks of life. And if the necessity again calls
for action, or if the present war is of long duration and tests the
strength and perseverance of our national character, let us not shrink
from the ordeal, but with a firm reliance upon an Almighty God and a
righteous cause, let us go forth in this good fight, we of this
generation and our children, and faithfully discharge the duties of
Christian soldiers in defense of truth, justice, and our country.</p>

<p><span class = "firstword">By</span> the Constitution of 1789,
Congress is empowered “to regulate commerce, to provide and maintain a
navy, and make rules for the government and regulation of the land and
naval forces.” The initiatory steps for establishing and regulating a
navy were taken by the Continental Congress in November and December,
1775. The management of naval affairs was first assigned to a Marine
Committee of Congress, appointed Dec. 11, 1775, which in 1779
(June&nbsp;9), was converted into Commissioners, and before the close of
that year, into a Board of Admiralty, which consisted of five members,
two of whom were members of Congress, with a secretary, who was
appointed by Congress. In 1781 (Feb.&nbsp;7), a Secretary of Marine was
created to execute all the duties and powers of the Board of Admiralty.
In the condition of the public treasury, and “in the dilatory and
parsimonious action of the several States in forwarding funds for the
construction of ships, docks, and naval arsenals, and for the support of
the naval service,” Congress voted in August, 1783, “that it was not
advisable to purchase ships for the present.”</p>

<p>The necessities of a disordered commerce, and of a sufficient naval
force to protect the navigation of the country, and repel the first
approach of a hostile army from abroad, were among the motives for
establishing a more efficient federal government. But until the danger
of war with England became imminent, a large party in the country, in
and out of Congress, opposed the necessary appropriations for putting
the Navy of the United States on a respectable footing.</p>

<p>In constituting the executive departments of the national government
under the Constitution, the administration of the navy and naval affairs
were committed to the War Department, where it remained till 1798, when
(April&nbsp;30) an Act was passed “to establish an executive department
to be denominated the Department of the Navy.”</p>

<p>The Act of March 27, 1794, by which the construction and manning
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page886" id = "page886">886</a></span>
of four ships of 44 guns each, and two of 36 were ordered, was called
for by the depredations on our commerce, and particularly in the
Mediterranean Sea. In this Act the appointment of eight midshipmen, to
rank with the warrant and petty officers, was authorized, and the Navy
Register bears the names of only eight officers holding that rank prior
to 1800. In 1801 the naval force of the United States consisted of 13
ships, viz.: 4 of 44 guns each (<i>United States</i>, <i>President</i>,
<i>Constitution</i>, and <i>Philadelphia</i>); 4 of 36 guns each
(<i>Chesapeake</i>, <i>Constellation</i>, <i>Congress</i>, and <i>New
York</i>); 5 of 32 guns each (<i>Benton</i>, <i>Essex</i>, <i>Adams</i>,
and <i>John Adams</i>); and by an Act of that year all others were
ordered to be sold, and the completion of any more in the yards, was
suspended. But the insults to our flag and destruction of our commerce
by the Barbary powers, and the privateers of England and France, aroused
such a feeling in the country that Congress ordered a squadron to be
fitted out for the Mediterranean in 1803, which proved to be the school
in which the seamanship of the Navy was trained, and the gallantry of
its officers signally displayed. In the legislation of this period
originated the “gun-boat” policy as an auxiliary means of harbor
defense. In 1805 the first vessel of this class was added to the
Mediterranean squadron, and in 1806 the President announced that 50 more
could be relied on for the naval service. Gun-boats, properly
constructed and armed, are now part of the system of harbor defense in
all countries.</p>

<p>By an Act of Congress approved April 21, 1806, the whole number of
able seamen, ordinary seamen and boys, for the United States Navy was
not to exceed 925. March 3, 1807, the President was authorized to employ
500 additionals, increasing the authorized number to 1,425. January 31,
1809, the President was authorized to employ 3,600 able seamen, ordinary
seamen and boys, in addition to the number of petty officers, seamen,
etc., previously authorized, which increased the number of enlisted men
allowed to 5,125.</p>

<p>In 1810 an appropriation was made to test the value of torpedo or
submarine explosives, as engines of war, and in 1842 to test the
submarine battery ignited by a submerged electric wire, devised by
Samuel Colt. The introduction, of these “engines of war” into the
defense of Southern harbors, in 1861-65, demonstrated their efficiency
and inaugurated a new system of not only harbor defense, but of
attack.</p>

<p>March 30, 1812, the President was further authorized to increase the
seamen, etc., and as far as necessary to equip the frigates
<i>Chesapeake</i>, <i>Constellation</i>, and <i>Adams</i>, any law to
the contrary notwithstanding.
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page887" id = "page887">887</a></span>
In this Act provision was made for the appointment of a schoolmaster to
each ship having a complement of 12 midshipmen.</p>

<p>March 3, 1813, he was authorized to have built six sloops-of-war, and
to have them manned and equipped, and to employ the number of seamen
which were necessary for such vessels as were authorized by law to be
put in commission.</p>

<p>In 1816, in the appropriation annually of $1,000,000 for eight years
to the gradual increase of the Navy by nine 74 gun-ships, and twelve 44
gun-frigates, provision was made to procure the steam-engines and build
and equip three steam-batteries for the defense of ports and
harbors&mdash;the introduction of a new element into the naval service.
In 1839 the Secretary was authorized to construct three steam-vessels of
war, “according to the best advices that could be obtained.”</p>

<p>In 1837, after strenuous efforts to enlist Congress in some
systematic plan for supplying the navy with well instructed and <ins
class = "correction" title = "text has ‘thoroughy’">thoroughly</ins>
disciplined seamen, the Secretary was authorized to enlist under certain
conditions, boys between the ages of 13 and 18, who should receive
special opportunities for school and professional training.</p>

<p>In 1844, $100,000 was appropriated to build at Pittsburg an iron
steamer (the <i>Alleghany</i>); and the appearance and exploits of the
<i>Merrimac</i> and the <i>Monitor</i>, in the waters of the Chesapeake,
in 1863, introduced a new system of naval construction and armament, not
only into our navy, but in less than ten years revolutionized the
ship-yards and ordnance foundries of the world.</p>

<p>By Act of March 3, 1845, it was provided “that the whole number of
petty officers, seamen, ordinary seamen, landsmen and boys, in the naval
service, shall not exceed 7,500 at any one time during the fiscal year,”
for which appropriation was then made.</p>

<p>By Act of March 3, 1857, the Secretary of the Navy was authorized to
enlist 8,500 men for the Navy, instead of 7,500. During the late civil
war the limitation of enlisted men was suspended; and in his annual
report, December, 1862, the Secretary states the number of persons
employed on board our naval vessels, including receiving ships and
recruits, as about 28,000; and in his report of December, 1865, he says
the number was increased to 51,500 at the close of the war, which in
1867 had been reduced to 11,900.</p>

<p>In 1864 the Secretary of the Navy revived the system of naval
apprenticeship, which was inaugurated under the Act of March 2, 1837,
but suspended because the favorable results anticipated from a fair
trial were not realized at once, under various disadvantages of a new
enterprise, and because Congress, in 1845, by limiting
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page888" id = "page888">888</a></span>
the whole number of persons employed in the naval service, compelled the
Department to discharge boys instead of men.</p>

<p>By Act of June 17, 1868, the number of persons enlisted into the
Navy, including apprentices and boys, was limited to 8,500&mdash;a
limitation actually below the maximum which existed prior to the war,
and compelled the department to reduce the number of naval apprentices,
and finally to again abandon that system.</p>

<p>The number of line officers is now (1871) limited by law to one
admiral, one vice-admiral, 10 rear admirals, 25 commodores, 50 captains,
90 commanders; total flag and commanding officers, 177. To these are
added 80 lieutenant commanders, 280 lieutenants, 200 masters and
ensigns&mdash;making the total line officers of all grades, excepting
midshipmen (309 including those at Annapolis), 737.</p>

<p>The medical staff consists of 180, viz.: 15 medical directors
(captains); 15 inspectors (commanders); 50 surgeons (Lieut.-commanders),
and 100 passed assistant and assistant surgeons.</p>

<p>The engineers’ department (total 250) includes 10 chief engineers
(captains); 15 <i>do.</i> (commanders); 45 <i>do.</i>
(lieut.-commanders); 100 assistants (masters and ensigns). There are 126
paymasters, 13 ranking as captains; 13 as commanders; 50 as
lieut.-commanders. The number of chaplains is limited to 24, and of
professors to 12.</p>

<p>Although, strangely enough, not under the administration of the Navy
Department, the inauguration of the Coast Survey in 1807, and its
thorough prosecution since 1844, when the employment of officers of the
army and navy in the work was authorized; the recognition of the Naval
Observatory at Washington city, and authorizing the making astronomical
and meteorological observations, in the Act of August 3, 1848; the
assignment of a competent officer of the navy to the preparation of the
Nautical Almanac; the institution of the bureau of Hydrography and
Ordnance, in 1842; the employment of three suitable vessels of the navy
to test and perfect the plans of Lieutenant Maury in his investigations
of the winds and the currents of the ocean, by Act of March 3, 1849; the
concentration of the teaching staff of the corps of midshipmen
preparatory for their examination at the Naval Asylum at Philadelphia,
and their removal to separate accommodations at the old military station
of Fort Severn, in Annapolis, by order of Secretary Bancroft in 1845,
and the formal recognition of the institution as the Naval School, in
the appropriations for the navy in 1847&mdash;these and other acts of
Congress, and the action of the Department under them, are important
data in the history of the Navy and Naval Education&mdash;especially of
their scientific character.</p>

NAVAL ACADEMY AT ANNAPOLIS.</a></h3>

<p><span class = "firstword">The</span> history of the United States
Naval Academy, as an institution, opens October, 1845, but its germ and
growth in suggestions, for the practical instruction of midshipmen,
dates back to the beginning of the century. A&nbsp;school of the Navy
constituted one of the departments, or group of schools, in the plan of
a Military Academy drawn up by Alexander Hamilton, as Inspector General
of the Army, and submitted to Congress, January, 1800, in the Report of
the Secretary of War (James McHenry), whose department was at that time
charged with the management of naval affairs.</p>

<p>In 1808, General Williams, in a report on the enlargement of the
Military Academy at West Point, of which he was Superintendent,
recommended “that nautical astronomy, geography, and navigation should
be taught by the professor of mathematics,” and that the plan of the
institution should “take in the minor offices of the navy; but also any
youths from any of the States who might wish for such an education,
whether designated for the army or navy, or neither, and to let these be
assessed to the value of their education.” This plan was doubtless
suggested by the Polytechnic School of France, and if adopted at the
time, would have not only have given to the army and navy a much broader
and firmer basis of scientific attainments, but would have hastened the
construction of roads, bridges, canals, and railroads, and the
development of the mineral and other industrial resources of the
country, by turning out every year a number of young men, qualified in
scientific culture, to enter on the duties of civil, mining and
mechanical engineers, and become superintendents of manufacturing and
other corporate enterprises. In the absence of any special school of
preparation for such civil services, officers of the army were induced
to resign their commissions to superintend the construction of canals
and railroads under state and corporate auspices.</p>

<p>In the measures which grew out of the war of 1812, was the act of
January, 1813, “to increase the Navy of the United States,” in which
authority was given to the Secretary of the Department to
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page896" id = "page896">896</a></span>
employ a schoolmaster for each vessel to which 12 midshipmen were
assigned. By these, so far as appears in any published document, was
given the first formal employment of this class of officers.</p>

<p>In 1814 the Secretary (William Jones) suggested “the establishment of
a Naval Academy with suitable professors, for the instruction of the
officers of the Navy in those branches of Mathematics and experimental
philosophy, and in the service and practice of gunnery, theory of naval
architecture, and art of mechanical drawing, which are necessary to the
accomplishment of the naval officer.” This suggestion was renewed by his
successor, Smith Thompson, of New York, and a distinct proposition to
locate it on Governor’s Island, in the harbor of New York, by Secretary
S.&nbsp;L. Southard, in 1824. In a special communication to the Senate
in 1825, he says:</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>The younger officers enter at so early an age, that they can not be
accomplished, or even moderately accurate scholars. They are constantly
employed on ship-board, or in our navy-yards, where much achievement in
learning can not be expected. And yet the American naval officer is, in
fact, the representative of his country in every port to which he goes,
and by him is that country in greater or less degree estimated. “The
science and information requisite for a navy officer,” he repeats in his
Report for 1827, “is in no respect inferior to that required by the army
officers and engineers, and the interest as well as the honor of the
country are not less concerned in the correct performance of their
duties.”</p>
</div>

<p>President Adams (J. Q.) in his Annual Message, Dec. 5, 1825, remarks
that “the want of a Naval School of instruction corresponding with the
Military Academy at West Point, for the promotion of scientific and
accomplished officers, is felt with daily increasing aggravation.” In
his message, Dec. 4, 1827, he returns to the subject “as still
soliciting the sanction of the legislature,” adding&mdash;</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>Practical seamanship, and the art of navigation, may be acquired upon
the cruises of the squadrons, which, from time to time, are dispatched
to distant seas; but a competent knowledge, even of the art of
ship-building, the higher mathematics and astronomy; the literature
which can place our officers on a level of polished education with the
officers of other maritime nations; the knowledge of the laws, municipal
and national, which in their intercourse with foreign states and their
governments, are continually called into operation; and above all, that
acquaintance with the principles of honor and justice, with the higher
obligations of morals, and of general laws, human and divine, which
constitute the great distinction between the warrior patriot and the
licensed robber and pirate; these can be systematically taught and
eminently acquired only in a permanent school, stationed upon the shore,
and provided with the teachers, the instruments, and the books, adapted
to the communication of these principles to the youthful and inquiring
mind.</p>
</div>

<p>In 1841, Secretary Upshur renewed the recommendation of his
predecessors, and a bill to establish a naval school at or near Fortress
Monroe, passed the Senate, but was not acted upon in the House.</p>

<p>The nucleus of a school was formed when the midshipmen were first
ordered to the Naval Asylums at Philadelphia and other places, to
prepare for their examination, and several of the professors of
Mathematics repaired there to give instruction.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page897" id = "page897">897</a></span>
<p>In 1845 the Secretary of the Navy (George Bancroft), inaugurated and
completed in four months an arrangement by which a Naval School, with
its corps of professors, was instituted in a suitable location, without
any special appropriation, and with only the existing authority of acts
of Congress. The original plan is best set forth in Mr. Bancroft’s
letter to Commodore Franklin Buchanan, whom he appointed superintendent
of the institution.</p>


<p class = "rightside"><span class = "smallcaps">Navy Department</span>,
August 7th, 1845.</p>

<p class = "smallcaps">Sir:</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>The Secretary of War, with the assent of the President, is prepared
to transfer Fort Severn to the Navy Department, for the purpose of
establishing there a school for midshipmen.</p>

<p>In carrying this design into effect, it is my desire to avoid all
unnecessary expense&mdash;to create no places of easy service&mdash;no
commands that are not strictly necessary&mdash;to incur no charge that
may demand new annual appropriations; but, by a more wise application of
moneys already appropriated, and officers already authorized, to provide
for the better education of the young officers of the navy. It is my
design not to create new officers, but, by economy of administration, to
give vigor of action to those which at present are available; not to
invoke new legislation, but to execute more effectually existing laws.
Placed by their profession in connection with the world, visiting in
their career of service every climate and every leading people, the
officers of the American navy, if they gain but opportunity for
scientific instruction, may make themselves as distinguished for culture
as they have been for gallant conduct.</p>

<p>To this end it is proposed to collect the midshipmen who from time to
time are on shore, and give them occupation during their stay on land in
the study of mathematics, nautical astronomy, theory of morals,
international law, gunnery, use of steam, the Spanish and the French
languages, and other branches essential, in the present day, to the
accomplishment of a naval officer.</p>

<p>The effect of such an employment of the midshipmen, can not but be
favorable to them and to the service. At present they are left, when
waiting orders on shore, masters of their own motions, without steady
occupation, young, and exulting in the relief from the restraint of
discipline on shipboard.</p>

<p>In collecting them at Annapolis for purposes of instruction, you will
begin with the principle that a warrant in the navy, far from being an
excuse for licentious freedom, is to be held a pledge for subordination,
industry and regularity,&mdash;for sobriety, and assiduous attention to
duty. Far from consenting that the tone of the discipline and morality,
should be less than at the universities or colleges of our country, the
President expects such supervision and management as shall make of them
an exemplary body, of which the country may be proud.</p>

<p>To this end you have all the powers for discipline conferred by the
laws of the United States, and the certainty that the department will
recommend no one for promotion, who is proved unworthy of it from
idleness or ill-conduct or continuing ignorance, and who can not bear
the test of a rigid examination.</p>

<p>For the purpose of instruction, the department can select from among
twenty-two professors and three teachers of languages. This force, which
is now almost wasted by the manner in which it is applied, may be
concentrated in such a manner as to produce the most satisfactory
results. Besides, the list of chaplains is so great that they can not
all be employed at sea, and the range of selection of teachers may be
enlarged by taking from their number some who would prefer giving
instruction at the school to serving afloat. The object of the
department being to make the simplest and most effective arrangement for
a school; you will be the highest officer in the establishment, and will
be intrusted with its government. It is my wish, if it be possible, to
send no other naval officer to the school, except such as may be able
and willing to give instruction. Among the officers junior to yourself,
there are many whose acquisitions and tastes may lead them to desire
such situation. For this end
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page898" id = "page898">898</a></span>
the department would cheerfully detach three or four of the lieutenants
and passed midshipmen, who, while they would give instruction, would be
ready to aid you in affairs of discipline and government. Thus the means
for a good naval school are abundant, though they have not yet been
collected together and applied.</p>

<p>One great difficulty remains to be considered. At our colleges and at
West Point, young men are trained in a series of consecutive years; the
laws of the United States do not sanction a preliminary school for the
navy; they only provide for the instruction of officers who already are
in the navy. The pupils of the naval school being, therefore, officers
in the public service, will be liable at all times to be called from
their studies and sent on public duty. Midshipmen, too, on their return
from the sea, at whatever season of the year, will be sent to the
school. Under these circumstances, you will be obliged to arrange your
classes in such a manner as will leave opportunity for those who arrive,
to be attached to classes suited to the stage of their progress in their
studies. It will be difficult to arrange a system of studies which will
meet this emergency; but with the fixed resolve which you will bring to
the work, and with perseverance, you will succeed.</p>

<p>Having thus expressed to you some general views, I leave you, with
such assistance as you may require, to prepare and lay before this
department for its approbation a plan for the organization of the naval
school at Fort Severn, Annapolis.</p>

<p>The posts to which you and those associated with you will be called
are intended to be posts of labor; but they will also be posts of the
highest usefulness and consideration. To yourself, to whose diligence
and care the organization of the school is intrusted, will belong, in a
good degree, the responsibility of a wise arrangement. Do not be
discouraged by the many inconveniences and difficulties which you will
certainly encounter, and rely implicitly on this department as disposed
to second and sustain you, under the law, in every effort to improve the
character of the younger branch of the service.</p>
</div>

<p class = "center">I am, respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>

<p class = "rightside">GEORGE BANCROFT.</p>

<p>Com’r <span class = "smallcaps">Franklin Buchanan</span>,</p>

<p class = "inset">United States Navy, Washington.</p>

<p>Under these instructions the school was duly organized at Fort
Severn, Annapolis, and formally opened, October 10, 1846, with 36
midshipmen, appointed in 1840, and who were, before resorting to
Annapolis, preparing for examination at the Naval Asylum at
Philadelphia; 13 of the date of 1841, who were to remain at their
studies until drafted for sea, and 7 acting midshipmen, appointed in
1845. The first staff of instruction consisted, besides Commander
Buchanan, of Lieutenant James H. Ward, in gunnery and steam; Surgeon
J.&nbsp;L. Lockwood, in chemistry; Chaplain George Jones, in English
studies; Prof. Henry H. Lockwood, in natural philosophy; and Prof.
Girault, in French.</p>

<p>In 1846, Congress appropriated an amount not exceeding $28,000 for
repairs, improvements, and instruction at Fort Severn, Annapolis, Md.;
and a like amount in 1847 for the same objects, “including a purchase of
land not exceeding 12 acres, for the use of the Naval School.” In the
same year (Dec. 1847), Secretary Mason recommended a practice ship.</p>

<p>Down to 1849, the regulations provided for two years’ study at
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page899" id = "page899">899</a></span>
the School, followed by three years’ service at sea, and then two years’
study at the School. This alternation of study and practice&mdash;of
practice at sea associated with opportunities of study, and of study at
school with many advantages of testing principles by experiments and the
observations of professors and officers of experience, possessed
advantages which still commend it to the minds of many officers over
that of longer continuous study at school before practice in earnest is
begun. The old system had its shortcomings, but it turned out good
seamen and gallant officers, and its best features ought to be again
engrafted on the new.</p>

<p>In 1849, a board of officers was directed by the Secretary of the
Navy to consider the organization of the school at Annapolis, and report
to the department. This was done, and new regulations were matured, and
ordered to go into effect on the first of July, 1850. The teachers’
staff was enlarged, and a practice ship, the Preble, a sloop-of-war of
the third class, was attached for the purpose of a summer cruise, and
the institution was henceforth styled in Acts of Congress and Reports of
the Secretary, the Naval Academy. The course of instruction was arranged
for four years, with an interval of two or three months in the summer
devoted to a practice cruise for two of the classes. The President was
authorized to appoint a Board of Visitors, whose functions were “to
witness the examinations of the several classes, and examine into the
police, discipline, and general management of the Academy.”</p>

<p>The new system began in October, 1850, under Commander C. K.
Stribling, as Superintendent, who was relieved in 1853 by Commander
L.&nbsp;M. Goldsborough, who was in turn relieved by Captain George S.
Blake, in 1857, who continued in the superintendence till 1867, when
Admiral Porter was assigned to the position, which he held till 1870,
when Commodore J.&nbsp;L. Worden succeeded him.</p>

<p>The first or lowest class in the four years’ course, entered in
October, 1851, and graduated in June, 1854, having had two summer
cruises of practice, and a long period of continuous study.</p>

<p>The necessities of the War, which as early as April, 1861, had made
Annapolis the seat of military operations, caused the removal of the
Academy&mdash;its professors, students, library and apparatus&mdash;in
the month of May, to Newport, first to Fort Adams, and afterwards to the
Atlantic House in the town, and to the <i>Constitution</i> and other
ships, which were not fit for active service, in the inner harbor. All
the members of the three highest classes were ordered into active
service, and with the fourth class, and 200 newly appointed, the system
of instruction went on as in times of peace.</p>

<p class = "heading"><i>Course of Studies in 1864.</i></p>

<p>In the organization of the Naval School at Annapolis, in 1845, the
ordering of the course of studies was left practically with Prof.
William Chauvenet, a graduate of Yale College, who had been commissioned
professor of mathematics in 1841, and had acted as such in the
instruction of midshipmen in the Naval Asylum at Philadelphia. The
following is substantially the arrangement proposed by him for the
classes when fully organized&mdash;the main deviation in the course as

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page902" id = "page902">902</a></span>
examination of the graduating class, in order that the report required
of the Visitors might cover the operations of the Academy for the year
1864.</p>

<p>Every facility for prosecuting their investigations was extended to
the Visitors by the Superintendent, Officers, Professors, and
Students.</p>


<h4><a name = "annapolis_condition" id = "annapolis_condition" href =

<p>In presenting some details of the condition of the Naval Academy as
they found it, and in offering suggestions for its improvement, which
the submitting of a report implies, the Visitors are not unmindful that
the institution is not at present furnished with permanent buildings and
equipments in all respects adapted to its purpose;&mdash;that even such
as are furnished were selected with reference to a smaller than the
present number of pupils;&mdash;that its staff of instructors and course
of instruction have been disturbed by the pressing exigencies of a great
war, calling off into actual service some of its most experienced
teachers;&mdash;that the education which it aims to give is not general
but special, not covering the whole ground of a generous culture, but
particularly adapted to make accomplished seamen and
midshipmen;&mdash;and, moreover, that in an educational field so wide
and subjects of inquiry so numerous as attach themselves to the details
of such a school, a brief visit, made while the institution is not
following its usual daily routine, is not in all respects the most
favorable to the formation of just and reliable opinions. They at the
same time believe that the government and people expect that the liberal
appropriations in its favor will be expended with a judicious economy,
and that the knowledge imparted will be accurate, thorough, and
professional, and that its graduates will be really fitted for that rank
of the service for which they are professedly trained. They recognize
the fact that the school is yet in the youth of its development, and
also that its purpose is not only to perpetuate naval science as it has
been taught, but to maintain a progressive course of instruction,
engrafting thereon all necessary or possible improvements.</p>


<p class = "heading"><i>Organization for Administration and
Instruction.</i></p>

<p>The Visitors find the Naval Academy, subordinate to the direct
supervision of the Department, under the immediate government of a
Superintendent, Commodore George S. Blake, who is held responsible for
its discipline and management. He is assisted as chief executive officer
by the Commandant of Midshipmen, Commander Donald M. Fairfax, who
resides in the Academy building on shore, and is also head of the
department of Seamanship, Naval
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page903" id = "page903">903</a></span>
Gunnery, and Naval and Infantry Tactics. The Commandant is assisted in
the different departments of his duty on ship and shore by three senior
assistants and eleven assistants, nine of the latter being of the rank
of lieutenant, and the remainder lieutenant-commanders. Two of the
senior assistants have charge of the Practice-ships Marion and
Macedonian, and also assist in instruction; six of the assistants are
engaged in executive duty on board the School-ships Constitution and
Santee, while the others, as well as these, are charged with certain
branches of instruction in the department of which the Commandant is
chief.</p>

<p>There are also attached to the Academic Staff one Professor of
Astronomy, Navigation, and Surveying; two Professors of Mathematics,
with six assistants in the same department; one Professor of Natural and
Experimental Philosophy, with two assistants; one Professor of Ethics
and English Studies, with nine assistants; one Professor of the French
language, with an assistant; one Professor of the Spanish language; one
Professor of Drawing and Draughting, with an assistant; one
Sword-master, with an assistant; and one Librarian, who acts also as
assistant in Mathematics, and Ethics and English studies. The officers
not attached to the Academic Staff include a Paymaster, a Surgeon, with
two assistants, a Chaplain, (with three, who are engaged as
instructors,) a Commissary, Storekeeper, Secretary, Treasurer, and
clerks to the Superintendent and Commandant.</p>

<p>The Academic Board is composed of the Superintendent, the officers in
charge of the Practice and School-ships, and the professors, except that
the professors of French, Spanish, and Drawing take part only upon
matters pertaining to their own departments. The Board is required to
conduct and regulate all examinations of candidates and students,
preparing the necessary papers and reports in connection therewith, to
prescribe the order and times of instruction, to recommend text-books
for the approval of the Naval Department, and books, instruments, and
other necessary material for instruction, to recommend at pleasure the
restoration or farther trial of students that have been dismissed or
found deficient in scholarship, to grant certificates of graduation, and
to report from time to time, on the system of studies and instruction
pursued, and propose such improvements as experience may suggest.</p>


<p class = "heading"><i>Buildings and Material Equipment.</i></p>

<p>The material arrangements for the accommodation of the Academy, for
the lodging, subsistence, and comfort of the pupils in health and
sickness, and for study and instruction, both scientific and
professional,
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page904" id = "page904">904</a></span>
although made on a sudden emergency, for temporary occupancy, and for a
smaller number, are far from being insufficient in extent, or
particularly objectionable, when compared with similar arrangements for
other great schools. The main building on shore is of wood, originally
intended to lodge and board a large number of guests, and as adapted to
the uses of the Academy, accommodates about half of the classes as well
as most boarding schools provide for their pupils. The arrangements are
not as convenient or as safe from fire as those at Annapolis; but they
are too good to be complained of, even if they do require a strict
observance of regulations, or special organization and diligence to
protect from fire, which would carry mourning into many homes. Good
discipline and good recitations, and a large amount of military and
naval knowledge are secured under the difficulties such as they are,
which the Department, be they great or small, will, doubtless, remove at
the earliest possible moment. In any permanent or temporary arrangement,
on ship or shore, while the privacy and comfort of separate lodgings for
pupils should as far as practicable be secured, the Visitors recommend
that convenient halls be provided, properly ventilated, warmed and
lighted, and supplied with the best dictionaries, encyclopedias, and
naval histories and biographies&mdash;to be occupied for study at
certain hours by such pupils as have not acquired the power of
concentrating attention, and the habit of solitary study&mdash;a power
and habit of the highest importance, but very rarely attained. The same
rooms might be open to the pupils at certain hours every day for the
purpose of reading naval histories and biographies, and for consulting
the encyclopedias and other books of reference. The formation of right
habits of study and the habit and mode of reading such books to the best
advantage should be made a matter of special and frequent inculcation by
the head of each department of study.</p>

<p>The lack of suitable buildings for lodging, subsistence, and study,
for a portion of the pupils, is supplied by an extension of the
School-ship System, first inaugurated on board of the “Plymouth,” at
Annapolis, in 1849, in our system, although always the main feature in
the French system of naval education. The old “Constitution” and the
“Santee,” properly moored in the harbor of Newport and adapted, are used
for the residence and study of the younger classes, which are in this
way brought more readily into the daily routine of the school and the
service without the vulgar annoyances, to which the youngest classes are
almost universally subjected, when lodged in the immediate neighborhood
of the next older class. If School-ships
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page905" id = "page905">905</a></span>
are to constitute a permanent, integral feature of the Academy, the
details of arrangements for separate lodging and class study require
additional attention. For the present, recitations are attended in
suitable buildings on Goat Island, near which the ships are moored and
reached by covered passages. On this island is sufficient room for all
sorts of athletic sports, military drill, and target practice.</p>

<p>The “Macedonian” and “Marion” are used for practice in the evolution
of guns and other naval tactics by the several classes. To these are
added, at least for the purposes of the summer cruise, the screw steamer
“Marblehead” and the yacht “America.”</p>


<p class = "heading"><i>Number of Pupils&mdash;Entrance
Examination.</i></p>

<p>The number of pupils belonging to the Naval Academy in the year
closing June, 1864, was 458, distributed into four classes, generally
according to the period of their connection with the institution, with a
staff of 57 officers and instructors. This is an astonishing development
of the Academy in respect to pupils, as well as in the number of the
teaching staff, and equipment for professional training, since Oct.
10th, 1845, when the Academy found a location at Fort Severn in
Annapolis, or since January 1st, 1846, when it was reported to have 36
midshipmen and six professors and instructors, including the
Superintendent. To judge of the progressive development of the
institution, and of the results of the annual examination which they
were appointed to witness, the Visitors deemed it necessary to ascertain
the average condition of each class as to age and attainments, at the
time of becoming connected with the Academy, and with the general
results of the entrance examination&mdash;this examination being the
only check on the admission of unqualified candidates&mdash;no previous
examination being held in the districts or States from which they
come.</p>

<p>By law and regulations governing the admission of candidates into the
Academy, the maximum number of pupils is limited to 526, viz., two for
every Congressional district or territory, appointed on the nomination
of the member or delegate, from actual residents of the district, if
such nomination is made to fill a vacancy duly notified, prior to the
first day of July in any year, and if not so made, by the Secretary of
the Navy; and twenty-five more appointed by the President, two for and
from the District of Columbia, ten from the country at large, ten from
the sons of officers of the army and navy, and three from the enlisted
boys of the navy. All candidates who receive notice of their provisional
appointment must present themselves to the Superintendent for
examination
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page906" id = "page906">906</a></span>
between the 20th and 31st of July, or September in case of second
appointments. The examination is twofold; first, before a medical board,
consisting of the surgeon resident and two other medical officers
designated by the Department; and second, before the Academic Board. The
candidate must be found, according to the law of 1864, to be between the
ages of fourteen and eighteen years&mdash;of good moral
character&mdash;physically sound, well formed, and of robust
constitution&mdash;and pass a satisfactory examination in reading,
writing, spelling, arithmetic, geography and English grammar.</p>

<p>The requisition as to age was advanced from 16 in 1861, to its
present maximum in 1864, while the Board was in session, and conforms in
that respect to the age which they had decided to recommend. The
traveling expenses of the successful candidates are paid.</p>

<p>The Visitors were furnished on application with tables exhibiting the
statistics of these entrance examinations from 1851 to 1863 inclusive.
From these tables it appears that out of 1,522 candidates, nominated and
appointed conditionally, but afterwards examined, 313 or one-fifth of
the whole were rejected as unqualified, although the attainments
required were such as any graduate of a common school should possess. Of
the number (1,209) admitted, 466, more than one-third, failed on the
first year’s course. Out of the number who failed at the earlier
examinations, three hundred and thirty-one were turned back for a second
trial, and after floundering along in the lower sections, only a very
small per cent. succeeded in graduating. Of the whole number admitted,
(1,209,) only 269 graduated, including 93 who were received into the
service from 1861 to 1864 before completing their studies.</p>

<p>From another table, covering the entrance examinations from 1860 to
1864 inclusive, it appears that out of 1,093 candidates who presented
themselves for admission, 807 were admitted, while 53 were rejected by
the Medical Board, 219 by the Academic Board, 11 withdrew, and 3 were
found to be over the maximum age.</p>

<p>From another table, exhibiting the ages of the successful and
unsuccessful candidates, it appears that out of 1,141 candidates
examined, 201 (18&nbsp;per cent.) were rejected, and of the number
rejected, 177 were under 17 years of age. Of the 940 admitted, 313
(33&nbsp;per cent.) failed the first year, and of the number that
failed, 254 were under 17 years of age. The average age of the
candidates admitted was 16 years and 2 months, and of those who failed,
15 years and 10 months.</p>

<p>The fact that one-fifth of the whole number nominated failed to
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page907" id = "page907">907</a></span>
pass the examination in the most rudimentary branches of a common
English education&mdash;and in only the most elementary portions of
these branches&mdash;indicates unmistakably how little regard has been
paid to school attendance and proficiency in the selection of
candidates. To judge how far these failures might be attributed to a
laudable strictness on the part of the Academic Board, the entrance
examination papers, which are filed away from year to year, were called
for, and from those it appears that the questions asked and exercises
required were few and simple&mdash;far too few and simple&mdash;far
below the requirements of any Public High School; and yet such wretched
perversions of the orthography of the most common words, such mistakes
in American geography, such bungling use of the English language in the
composition of a simple letter, such numerous failures in arithmetical
operations not going beyond the elementary rules and simple exercises in
fractions and proportion, it would be difficult to gather from all the
Public High School entrance examinations of the country. More strictness
on the part of the Academic Board would have saved the government
hundreds of thousands of dollars, for of the candidates allowed to pass,
two-fifths fail on the studies of the first year, although these studies
belong to a good English education, and are preliminary to a special
scientific naval training&mdash;showing a want of suitable preparatory
knowledge, of aptitude for study, or of will and desire to learn.
A&nbsp;portion of those who fail the first year are put back for a
second year’s trial, and in some instances for a third, and the
proportion of those thus put back who finally succeed in graduating is
very small, thereby causing a total loss of the thousands of dollars
expended upon each. From data gathered from the annual reports of the
Department, it appears the annual expense of a pupil of the Naval school
exceeds $1,500, and that each graduate who has been four years in the
institution costs the government over $10,000. But the pecuniary loss is
not the only consideration&mdash;the places filled by pupils, no matter
what their courage or general ability, unable or unwilling to profit by
the opportunities of scientific and professional instruction so lavishly
provided, might be filled by competent, ambitious, diligent, and
courageous young men, if they could have had their qualifications tested
by a competitive examination.</p>


<p class = "heading"><i>Daily Routine.</i></p>

<p>The morning gun calls the cadets up at 6 o’clock. Inspection of the
rooms follows, when the bedding must be found arranged, the rooms swept,
and every thing in order. Ten minutes are given to chapel services, and
half an hour to breakfast, which is over at 7.15.
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page908" id = "page908">908</a></span>
Forty minutes recreation are then allowed, during which sick-roll is
called and such as report themselves indisposed are marched to the
hospital and reported to the surgeon. At 7.55 the sections are formed
under the supervision of the Officer of the Day, assisted by the section
leaders, and at 8 o’clock, on given signal, they are marched in close
order to their recitation rooms, in perfect silence and with strict
military decorum. All who are not engaged in the recitation rooms are
expected to be preparing their lessons in their own rooms, and it is the
duty of the superintendents of floors to see that they are there. The
dismissal and re-formation of sections at the end of each hour are
conducted with similar formality and regulated by special signals. Study
and recitation continue until 1 o’clock, when the cadets are formed in
order by the captains of crews, (the whole corps being organized in nine
guns’ crews, for the purposes of discipline and practical instruction,)
all special orders and rules for the day are read, and they are then
marched into the mess hall for dinner, which occupies forty minutes.
From 1.40 to 1.55 recreation is allowed and the sections are then again
formed as in the morning for recitation and study. At 4 o’clock ten
minutes are given to preparation for drill, as may be the order of the
day, and then follow instruction in fencing, infantry or artillery
drill, and recreation until parade and roll-call at sunset. Supper
immediately succeeds, to which half an hour is given, and recreation
until study-call at 6.30 or 7.00, according to the season. Study hours
continue until tattoo, at 9.30, during which time the cadets must all be
in their rooms, and after inspection of rooms all lights are
extinguished at 10 o’clock.</p>

<p>The routine on board ship is as far as possible the same. No control
is exercised over the occupation of the time by the cadets during study
hours, provided good order is preserved. No studies or exercises are
required on Saturday afternoon and one-half of each class may then be
allowed liberty beyond the limits of the Academy. A vacation is given at
the close of the second year, the only one in the whole course. As means
of recreation, chess, draughts, and all games of chance are strictly
forbidden. On the other hand, every facility is afforded for games of
ball, boxing, fencing, boating, &amp;c.</p>


<p class = "heading"><i>Course of Instruction, Examinations, and
Merit-Rolls.</i></p>

<p>The course of instruction at the Naval Academy is comprised in eight
departments, with their special branches, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>First Department</i>, in six branches&mdash;Practical Seamanship,
Theory and Practice of Gunnery, Naval Tactics, Infantry Tactics,
Howitzer Drill, and the Art of Defense.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page909" id = "page909">909</a></span>
<p><i>Second Department</i>, Mathematics, in seven
branches&mdash;Arithmetic and Algebra, Geometry, plane and solid,
Trigonometry, Mensuration, Descriptive Geometry, Analytical Geometry,
and the Differential and Integral Calculus.</p>

<p><i>Third Department</i>, in four branches&mdash;Astronomy, Practical
Astronomy, Navigation, and Surveying.</p>

<p><i>Fourth Department</i>, in eight branches&mdash;Mechanics of
Solids, Mechanics of Liquids, Pneumatics, Acoustics, Electricity, Heat,
Chemistry, and the Steam-Engine.</p>

<p><i>Fifth Deportment</i>, in seven branches&mdash;English Grammar,
Descriptive Geography, Physical Geography, Outlines of History,
Rhetoric, Ethics, and Political Science.</p>

<p><i>Sixth Department</i>&mdash;the French Language.</p>

<p><i>Seventh Department</i>&mdash;the Spanish Language.</p>

<p><i>Eighth Department</i>&mdash;Drawing and Draughting.</p>

<p>These studies are distributed into four annual courses for the four
regular classes, each class being subdivided into convenient sections,
usually according to the relative standing of the members. During the
last year the first class, of 36 cadets, has been graded into three
sections; the second class, of 59 cadets, into five sections; the third
class into six sections; and the fourth class, during the first term,
with 176 cadets, into fourteen sections, and in the second term, with
156 cadets, into twelve sections&mdash;each section receiving separate
instruction.</p>

<p>The more difficult portions of the several branches may be reserved
for the higher sections of the classes, and it is frequently the fact
that in certain branches no instruction whatever is given to the lowest
sections. Deviation from the general rule for the admission of cadets
only in the month of September has made the formation of “Intermediate
Classes” necessary, so that there are now two divisions of the second
class and two divisions of the third class. By this means the number of
sections is increased, the labors of instruction augmented, and much
inconvenience in other respects created. The demands of the times have
also introduced other irregularities into the course, hurrying the more
forward sections through their studies and detailing them into active
service at the close of the third year, with or without a graduating
examination, while the lower sections are retained through the whole
four years.</p>

<p>The Commandant of Midshipmen and the several professors are each at
the head of a special department, with such assistants as may be
necessary. The professors, instructors, and assistants are responsible
for the regular and orderly conduct of their respective
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page910" id = "page910">910</a></span>
classes and sections while under instruction, and must report all want
of preparation, absence, or misconduct. Daily notes are taken of the
progress and relative merit of each pupil in each of his studies. The
assistants must make weekly reports of such notes to the heads of their
departments, who in turn report to the Superintendent, recommending such
transfers as should be made from one section to another. The scale of
daily merit in each study embraces seven grades, with corresponding
values designated by numbers, as follows:&mdash;Thorough,
(4.0)&mdash;Very Good, (3.5)&mdash;Good, (3.0)&mdash;Tolerable,
(2.5)&mdash;Indifferent, (2.0)&mdash;Bad, (1.0)&mdash;Complete Failure,
(0.) The average standing for the week in each study accompanies the
report. Monthly reports are drawn up by the Academic Board for each
month in the academic year, showing the relative standing of the members
of each class in their different studies, and also their conduct or
demerits. These reports are based upon the weekly reports and upon the
results of the examinations, when such are held within the month, and
are posted for public inspection. The examination weeks are considered
of equal weight with those of the month.</p>

<p>The examinations are held by the Academic Board in the months of
February and June, and are sufficiently thorough to enable the Board to
decide upon the proficiency and relative merits of the members of the
several classes. After each June examination a “general merit-roll” is
formed for each class, for which purpose a maximum number or value is
assigned to each of the principal branches in the several departments.
The total amount of these maxima throughout the course is 1,000, and
they are distributed among the departments and branches, for the
different classes, as follows:&mdash;In the first year, to mathematics,
20&mdash;grammar and rhetoric, 10&mdash;geography, 10&mdash;history and
composition, 10&mdash;drawing, 10&mdash;conduct, 5&mdash;total,
65;&mdash;In the second year, to seamanship, 20&mdash;mathematics,
35&mdash;grammar and rhetoric, 15&mdash;history and composition,
10&mdash;French, 30&mdash;drawing, 25&mdash;conduct, 15&mdash;total,
150;&mdash;In the third year, to seamanship, 40&mdash;gunnery,
20&mdash;infantry tactics, 25&mdash;howitzer drill,
20&mdash;mathematics, 45&mdash;general astronomy, 25&mdash;practical
astronomy, navigation, and surveying, 15&mdash;mechanics,
30&mdash;physics, 25&mdash;moral science and international law,
20&mdash;French, 40&mdash;conduct, 30&mdash;total, 335;&mdash;In the
fourth year, to seamanship, 100&mdash;gunnery, 60&mdash;naval tactics,
30&mdash;practical astronomy, navigation, and surveying,
75&mdash;physics, 30&mdash;steam-engine, 35&mdash;moral science and
international law, 20&mdash;Spanish, 50&mdash;conduct, 50&mdash;total,
450. The minima values are fixed at one-third of the corresponding
maxima.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page911" id = "page911">911</a></span>
<p>The “general merit-roll” includes only such as pass a satisfactory
examination in all the principal branches of their class and have not
exceeding 200 demerits recorded against them. In the formation of the
roll, the individual having the highest standing in any branch for the
year receives the corresponding maximum number, while the one who has
the lowest standing receives the corresponding minimum. The intermediate
members of the class receive numbers proceeding by equal differences
from the maximum to the minimum, in the order of their relative merit as
fixed by their “class merit-rolls.” The gradation for conduct is
determined by allowing the maximum number to such as have no demerits,
and for others diminishing that maximum by 1/300 part for every demerit
recorded against them. All the numbers thus assigned to the several
members for the different branches of study and for conduct are then
added together, and the members are arranged in each class according to
the aggregates thus obtained. For the graduating class a “graduating
merit-roll” is formed by adding the aggregate numbers of each member
upon the several “general merit-rolls” for the four years and arranging
the order of the members according to these new aggregates. The highest
number reached upon the “graduating merit-roll,” by any one of the class
just graduating, was 859.</p>

<p>If any student at any examination fails to pass a satisfactory
examination in any principal branch, or has recorded against him more
than 200 demerits since the commencement of the academic year, a report
is made of the case to the Secretary of the Navy, showing the habits of
study, aptitude for study and for sea duties, and his general habits and
conduct, and upon his decision the student is dismissed, or upon
recommendation of the Academic Board, allowed to continue at the Academy
for further trial.</p>

<p>The final graduating examination is held by a special Board and
occurs, by a recent regulation, not less than one year after the close
of the course. This examination embraces seamanship and naval tactics,
practical gunnery, navigation, and management of steam-engines, and the
standing in these branches is combined to determine the relative merits
of the candidates. In assigning numbers, 1,000 is considered the maximum
and 333 the minimum for such as are considered qualified for promotion,
and the Board assigns such numbers within these limits as will fairly
express the relative qualifications of the members of the class. The
numbers thus assigned, when added to the numbers already assigned on the
“graduating merit-roll,” determine the standing of the graduates as
ensigns; the highest number taking precedence.</p>


<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page912" id = "page912">912</a></span>
<p class = "heading"><i>Text-Books. Studies of the past Year.</i></p>

<p>The method of teaching as at present pursued is almost wholly by
means of text-books and recitations. A&nbsp;series of lectures is
delivered in connection with the recitations in Natural Philosophy and
Chemistry. Without underrating the office of the text-book, the success
of the French Polytechnic method of teaching even the higher Mathematics
by lectures, collateral study, and examination, and the experience of
all schools, of the power of the human voice and of the human eye to
win, hold, and harmonize attention should not be lost to this
institution, many of whose pupils need the influence of such a method to
vitalize their powers of thinking and to bring within their grasp the
general principle or doctrine of the subjects taught.</p>

<p>The division of the classes into small sections of 12-14 midshipmen
each, of nearly equal standing, tends to secure the personal and
thorough instruction of each and all. The attempt was made, by
furnishing prepared blanks to the several departments, to ascertain the
character and actual amount of the studies and exercises accomplished by
the several sections during the eight months of study of the year
1863-4.&nbsp;The returns made are not complete, but it appears that the
English studies of the lowest class (in&nbsp;12-14 sections) have
consisted of one lesson a week in Spelling and Derivation, four in
Bullion’s English Grammar, four during the first term in Cornell’s
Geography, and during the second term in General History, with daily
exercises in Composition and the exercise of the Voice; in Mathematics,
five lessons a week during the first term in Greenleaf’s Common School
Arithmetic, and during the second term in Davies’ University Algebra. In
the upper sections, the Algebra was commenced within the first term and
more or less nearly finished at the close of the year. The highest
section had also five lessons a week for three weeks in Davies’
Elementary Geometry (5&nbsp;books) and instruction twice a week in
Drawing. The space in the several textbooks actually gone over varied
considerably in the different sections. It will be seen, therefore, that
the studies of this class, with the exception of Algebra and Geometry,
are simply those of every common school, and yet the lower section is
reported as having succeeded but “imperfectly” in Grammar, and “very
imperfectly” in Algebra. It is also to be stated that a part of the
class had received eight weeks additional preparatory instruction during
August and September, 1863.</p>

<p>In the third class, of six sections, there were three lessons per
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page913" id = "page913">913</a></span>
week, during the first term, in American History, and during the second
term in Rhetoric. The lower section prepared six English compositions
each term&mdash;the highest section, weekly compositions through the
second term. All the sections prepared three lessons weekly in French
during the first term and four lessons during the second, but with very
unequal progress. In Mathematics, (five lessons per week,) Algebra was
completed by the lower sections and reviewed by the higher in the first
four or five weeks, when Elementary Geometry was taken up by all, and
completed in the first term by the highest section. In the second term,
Elementary Geometry for three weeks by the lowest section, and
Trigonometry for the rest of the term&mdash;in the highest section,
Trigonometry for ten weeks, Mensuration two weeks, and Analytical
Geometry commenced, for three weeks. The first section had also three
lessons a week in Marine and Topographical Drawing, and during the first
term one lesson a week in Seamanship.</p>

<p>In the second class, of five sections, during the first term, five
lessons a week in Analytical Geometry, replaced in the highest section
by the Differential and Integral Calculus for five weeks; four lessons a
week in Statics, to which the first section added Dynamics, three weeks;
five lessons a week in Surveying, three weeks in each term, with
practical exercises. The lowest sections had also four lessons a week in
French, and the first section weekly lessons in Seamanship and Infantry
Tactics, and two lessons a week in Gunnery. In the second term, five
lessons a week in Dynamics, Hydrostatics, Pneumatics and Acoustics, with
twelve lectures, Surveying, three weeks, and Astronomy, ten weeks. Two
lessons a week in Wayland’s Moral Science. The first section had also
two lessons a week in Gunnery.</p>

<p>The first class, consisting of the three more advanced sections of
the second class, and in its third year of study, during the first term
were pursuing chiefly second class studies, having five lessons a week
in Physics, including Statics, Dynamics, Hydrostatics, Acoustics,
Magnetism, and Electricity, with sixteen lectures; four lessons a week
in Theory and Practice of Navigation (six weeks) and General Astronomy
(eleven weeks;) two lessons a week in Seamanship, and two in Gunnery,
Naval Light Artillery, and Field Fortifications. In the second term,
four lessons a week in Heat and Chemistry, with nine lectures; three in
Wayland’s Ethics and Kent’s Constitution of U.S., and International Law;
three in the Theory and Practice of Navigation; two in Seamanship; and
one in Gunnery, &amp;c. Two lessons a week were given through the year
in Spanish, by means of the French.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page914" id = "page914">914</a></span>
<p>In addition to the daily lessons of each class are the general
practical exercises by divisions, by the higher classes on shore
embracing daily exercises in Fencing, three exercises weekly in Infantry
Drill, Howitzer Drill once a week, the Great Gun Drill upon the Practice
Ships twice weekly in favorable weather, and a certain amount of Target
Practice by the first class. The younger classes on the school-ships
have also their special drills. Special instruction is given them in
boating, and the numerous cutters and launches belonging to the ships
afford ample opportunity for recreation and practice of this kind at
suitable times. The use of the “Rainbow,” a schooner-rigged craft of
15-20 tons, is also not unfrequently allowed to pleasure parties made up
from the cadets. Weekly bathing is enjoined and practiced throughout the
year as a sanitary regulation, but the absence of the cadets from port
during the summer months, while on the cruise, prevents the attainment
of that knowledge and skill in the art of swimming, which seem to the
Visitors so essential a requisite.</p>

<p>The general results of the examinations and exercises as observed by
the Visitors, may be stated as in general very favorable. The
examinations of the classes were made by sections and conducted by the
individual professors of the departments, with great fairness and
impartiality, without any purpose of embarrassing the pupils, and for
the single object of eliciting the extent, accuracy, and vividness of
the pupil’s knowledge of the topic. Written lists of questions were
furnished to the cadets on entering the examination rooms, which were
usually answered in writing upon the blackboard, with opportunity for
oral explanation. The difference in the proficiency shown by the higher
and lower sections, in all except the first class, was very strongly
marked. In the written answers, the writing was fair and legible, and
the spelling and composition very creditable&mdash;revealing in these
respects an immense improvement upon the entrance examination papers of
the same cadets. The Visitors would suggest that in future examinations
there should be more of paper, even if there should be less of
blackboard work, and that a portion of the questions should be handed in
on slips by the Visitors and answered in writing with ink, in presence
of the Board, by every member of the section present.</p>

<p>The practical professional exercises of the cadets upon the parade
ground and on board ship, embracing all the different branches of shore
and ship duty, (including a harbor cruise on board the Practice
Steamer,) and designed to exemplify the proficiency of the classes in
seamanship, gunnery, and naval and infantry tactics, were
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page915" id = "page915">915</a></span>
performed in the most satisfactory manner, justifying the professional
pride manifestly felt by those taking part in them. Moreover, these
exercises, instead of being executed under the direction, as heretofore,
of the respective Academic officers in command, were conducted under the
charge wholly of officers appointed from the midshipmen themselves.</p>


<p class = "heading"><i>Physical Training.</i></p>

<p>The unavoidable exposures and risks of the naval service require not
only a sound mind&mdash;a mind well informed, quick, and accurate in its
operations, but a sound body&mdash;a body supple, athletic, and tough to
resist the rapid alternations and continuous exposures of wet and cold
weather. Although careful and continuous training can do much to
develope and strengthen the qualities referred to, the records of the
Academy and of the service, as well as the present appearance of many of
the cadets, show that sufficient regard has not been paid to vigor and
elasticity of physical constitution, in the original appointment, or the
entrance medical examination. The regular military drill and evolutions,
the small arm and other exercises, in which the whole corps
participates, the professional practice in gunnery and seamanship, all
help to supply these deficiencies. There is still room for more careful
scrutiny for inherited tendencies and hidden defects, in the entrance
medical examination, as well as in the regular course of naval
education, for a well arranged system of gymnastic exercises and
athletic games, to give suppleness to the joints, steadiness to the
nerves, hardness to the bones, and elasticity to the sinews. Such games
and sports as the young universally accept with eagerness and pursue
with unflagging interest, should be systematically introduced. Ample
time, room, and encouragement by rank, prizes, and publicity, should be
given to make a fondness and indulgence in such games as cricket,
football, leaping, boating, &amp;c., the habit of every member of the
lower classes at least. An hour a day devoted to these healthful sports,
even if taken from the study and class-room,&mdash;even more, if taken
from the idle lounging, or the listless walk, or vulgar scuffling, will
give at once health and strength, increased capacity for study, and
valuable social qualities and manly virtues&mdash;all results of
emphatically the highest professional value.</p>

<p>As part of the physical training of naval cadets, the expansion of
the chest and the culture of the vocal organs should receive more
special attention than the word of command on parade, and the questions
and answers in the examination would indicate they had received.
A&nbsp;clear, full, decisive voice is an element of influence on
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page916" id = "page916">916</a></span>
the deck at all times, and of power in the hour of danger, as well as on
the field or in the senate chamber.</p>

<p>The first beginning of habits, secret or open, which waste the vigor
of the mind and body, should be watched with professional skill as well
as parental interest, and those cadets in whom such indulgencies have
grown into habits, should be cut off from the institution and service
without hesitation and without reprieve.</p>


<p class = "heading"><i>Domestic and Sanitary Arrangements.</i></p>

<p>The institution is peculiarly fortunate in having had for years a
Commissary who understands his business and gives universal satisfaction
to all concerned. The neatness of the kitchen, the supply, preparation,
and serving of the food, the geniality, good order, and enjoyment of the
mess-hours, and the fact that no complaint reached the Visitors from any
one of the 450 boys, blessed with good health and plenty of physical
exercise, makes the record of this department an exception to similar
departments in other large collegiate institutions. This comes from
having the right man in the right place.</p>

<p>The hospital arrangements on shipboard and on shore, although not as
large and quiet as would be desirable or as would be provided specially
in permanent quarters, are sufficient for the demands on their
accommodations. The location of the institution and the judicious
arrangement and management of the Academy as to cleanliness, exercise,
and diet, as well as the presence of a surgeon and two assistants on the
Academic staff, and numerous attendants for hospital service, would seem
to act as a preventive of accidents and disease, the mean daily
percentage of sick on ship and shore from Oct. 1st to May 31st being
returned at a little more than three per cent. out of an average
attendance of 447 midshipmen. In calling for the annual reports to the
Department of the medical condition of the institution, the Visitors
were informed that a duplicate copy or abstract was not retained. Such
copy or abstract would be highly convenient, and would seem to be even
necessary, if it is deemed advisable to have a periodical inspection of
the sanitary condition and requirements of the school.</p>


<p class = "heading"><i>Religious Observances and Instruction.</i></p>

<p>The regulations require that the students shall be assembled in the
chapel for prayers daily, fifteen minutes before the breakfast hour, and
that divine service shall be held on Sunday, which officers and students
are expected to attend, unless excused on the ground of conscientious
scruples, declared in writing by the former, and by the parents or
guardians of the latter. These daily and Sunday
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page917" id = "page917">917</a></span>
exercises are conducted by the regular Chaplain of the institution. He
is at the present time assisted in these and other such voluntary
religious labors by three other chaplains of the Navy, who are now in
residence as assistant professors. There are four Bible classes composed
of cadets, and over one-eighth of the members are communicants in the
different denominations of Newport. The student who brings, in his moral
culture from home, religious convictions and habits, can easily preserve
and strengthen them here, and no amount of instruction in the
institution can compensate for the neglect of parental example and
teaching in this respect. The absence of the religious element in the
character and training of youth is a fundamental defect, and no
institution of learning, special or general, can safely, for any length
of time, dispense with appropriate and adequate means of religious
instruction and a practical recognition of religious obligations,
consistent with due regard to the religious convictions of individuals
and the equal rights of all religious denominations. Such individual
convictions and denominational rights can be best respected, not by
ignoring the subjects themselves, but by selecting the chaplain from
time to time so as to represent different religious denominations, and
in all cases, in reference to his ability to be useful as chaplain in
this institution.</p>

<p>The reading of the Sabbath, and one of the exercises of Monday
morning might be so arranged as to harmonize with the religious
observances and uses of Sunday, and the whole be made to unfold and
enforce the great, definite, and unchanging obligations of every human
being to his fellow-men, to his country, and to God.</p>

<p>As part of the religious and moral instruction of the Academy, more
at least should be attempted to prevent, and if these unfortunately
exist, to eradicate certain vulgar and vicious habits, whose beginnings
are small, but which ultimately take complete possession of the
individual. Although the Visitors can not, from their own knowledge,
speak of its existence, they have had too many assurances from those who
did know, to have any doubt of the prevalence of the vulgar and immoral
practice of profanity, and that several of those addicted to it are
among the youngest members of their classes, who came here entirely pure
in this respect. The medical and police experience of the institution
detects the occasional existence of other tastes and habits more
directly affecting the health and morality of their victims, and which
should and doubtless do receive the considerate and vigilant attention
of the authorities, especially of the Chaplain, Surgeon and
Superintendent.</p>


<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page918" id = "page918">918</a></span>
<p class = "heading"><i>Discipline.</i></p>

<p>The Superintendent is charged with and held responsible for the good
order and discipline of the Academy, and it is made the duty of every
officer, professor, and instructor, having knowledge of any violation of
law or regulation, or of any crime, irregularity, neglect, or other
improper conduct, of which any student or any other one has been guilty,
to report the same without delay to the Superintendent. Offenses are
defined with great minuteness and precision, and the circle of
punishments embraces demerits on the roll of conduct, private and public
reprimand, confinement to Academy grounds, to room, or to guard-room,
and withdrawal on necessity, or dismission. In the administration of
discipline, the Superintendent is clothed with much power, which is
exercised by the present incumbent with great discretion and the
happiest results. The private memorandum and letter book of this
officer, respecting every case of discipline during the year, was placed
before the Visitors, and they can bear willing testimony to the
preventive admonition and parental regard with which he has exercised
his authority.</p>

<p>Demerits, to be considered in making up the conduct-rolls, are
assigned for all offenses. Such delinquencies as are not deemed
deserving of severer punishment are grouped into four classes, which
count ten, eight, six, four, and two demerits respectively, besides a
miscellaneous class counting from one to ten demerits according to
circumstances. The <i>total</i> demerits of each cadet is expressed by
the sum of all demerits standing against him on record for the year,
increased for the third class by one-sixth, for the second class by one
third, and for the first class by one-half.</p>

<p>No punishment of any kind can be inflicted by other authority than
that of the Superintendent. Report is read at evening parade of all
demerits and other punishments that have been inflicted during the day,
and opportunity is always given for excuse or explanation. Full record
is made of every case of discipline, and a monthly conduct-roll is
publicly posted showing the number of demerits against each cadet. It is
evident that this conduct-roll does not fairly represent the character
and conduct of the cadets, as a large number of demerits may be gained
by numerous minor offenses, which involve neither immorality nor
lawlessness, while a cadet who has been guilty of most flagrant acts of
vice and disobedience may still be charged with but few demerits. Yet
the conduct-roll has but a subordinate influence in determining the
general merit-rolls, and in the question of dismissal the fuller record
of punishments, as
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page919" id = "page919">919</a></span>
well as the demerit-roll, has its weight in determining the action of
authorities.</p>


<p class = "heading"><i>Financial Affairs.</i></p>

<p>All money appropriated for the support of the Naval Academy is drawn
for by the Paymaster and by him deposited with the Sub-Treasurer in
Boston. The Paymaster draws upon him, from time to time, to make his
disbursements.</p>

<p>The principal heads of expenditure for the fiscal year ending June
30th, 1864, are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<table class = "plaintext numbers drop">
<tr>
<td>Pay of Commissioned and Warrant Officers, Midshipmen, Seamen, and
others,</td>
<td>$241,771.71</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Pay of Professors and <ins class = "correction"
title = "text has ‘Asssistants’">Assistants</ins>,</td>
<td>35,000.00</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Expenses of the Academy, School and Practice Ships, Surgeon’s
necessaries, contingent expenses, and repairs of all kinds,</td>
<td>72,753.84</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The total of all expenditures from 1st July, 1863, to May 31st, 1864;
is reported at $383,419.41.</p>

<p>From the pay of the midshipmen, which is $500 per annum, $100 are
reserved yearly to be paid upon graduation, though this sum is sometimes
diminished by unavoidable circumstances. There is also deducted from
their pay, the amount of board&mdash;at present $16.50 per
month&mdash;and $3.00 per month for washing. The aggregate of these sums
is paid monthly by the Paymaster to the Commissary. Articles of clothing
for the midshipmen are provided under contract by the Storekeeper with
the approval of the Commandant. All other articles for their use are
purchased by the Storekeeper, from funds provided by the Paymaster, at
prices sanctioned by the Commandant.</p>

<p>The midshipmen receive such articles as they desire upon requisition
approved by the Commandant, and no other articles are permitted to be
sold to them than those which the Storekeeper is authorized to have.
Each midshipman has a pass-book in which his purchases are entered, and
regular report is made by the Storekeeper to the Paymaster, who charges
against each the aggregate amount of his purchases. On the 30th April,
1864, the amount of balances still due to the midshipmen was $44,579.93,
the aggregate of indebtedness by them being only $111.90.&nbsp;The
amounts to the credit of the members of the graduating class vary from
$180 to $400.</p>

<p>The accounts of the Commissary are examined quarterly by a committee
of three officers appointed by the Superintendent, to whom they make
report. The Visitors deemed at their duty to go
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page920" id = "page920">920</a></span>
behind the reports of this committee, and deputed one of their number to
examine personally the original accounts of the Commissary and
Storekeeper. As the result of this examination, which was conducted with
the most rigid scrutiny, it is but justice to state that they found the
accounts correct in all their details, and the prices of all articles as
low as they can be purchased at wholesale in the city of New York, and
the Visitors consider the financial affairs of the Academy as conducted
with commendable skill and fidelity.</p>

<p>While the Visitors bear willing testimony to the fidelity with which
the financial affairs of the Academy, as well as the departments of
subsistence, discipline, and instruction, are and have been
administered, they can not but express their disappointment at the very
small number of officers of the lowest rank which the institution has
contributed to the naval service. With an aggregate annual expenditure
of several hundred thousand dollars, the aggregate number of graduates,
since the opening of the four years’ course, in 1851, including the
three classes of 1858, ’59 and ’60, which were ordered into active
service in 1862 and ’63, before completing their studies, is but 269, or
at the rate of less than 22 each year, at an expense to the country of
over $12,000 for each graduate. If the 93 who entered the service with
only two or three years’ residence had completed their course, the
aggregate expense for each graduate would have exceeded $15,000. This,
as it appears to the Visitors, small result, is due mainly to the want
of care in selecting candidates, and the very low standard of general
scholarship required for entering the Academy. The experience of this
institution is the same as that of others of the same character; any
mode of selection which does not test in advance the natural aptitude
and preparation for the special studies of the course, and exclude
rigorously all who are found deficient, will burden the institution with
a number of students which will have to be thrown off after months and
sometimes years of struggling to incorporate them into the regular
classes and to the manifest injury, in the meantime, of the scholarship
and character of the institution. While a nomination by patronage, and a
pass examination have a direct tendency to reduce the average ability of
the selected candidates to the minimum required, a competitive
examination raises the general average to the maximum ability of all who
apply.</p>


<p class = "heading"><i>Graduating Class of 1864.</i></p>

<p>The present graduating class (consisting after the final examination
of&nbsp;31) at the close of its third year has completed the whole
course
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page921" id = "page921">921</a></span>
prescribed, excepting that the Calculus has been omitted and that
Surveying has been limited to instruction in Harbor and Coast Surveying,
from Bowditch. Steam and the Steam-engine have received fuller attention
from this than any preceding class, embracing six weeks of theory and
practice on board of the steamer Marblehead&mdash;altogether too little
attention for a department so important. Two summer cruises have been
made by this class&mdash;both coast cruises&mdash;the first on board the
John Adams, from June 6th to Sept. 30th, 1862; the second from 16th June
to 25th Sept., 1864, in which the following vessels were united, viz.:
Flagship Macedonian, sloop of war Marion, screw steamer Marblehead, and
the yacht America. Upon these cruises the midshipmen were practiced in
all the regular duties attaching to the posts of lieutenant and master,
taking by turns upon themselves the working of the ship, in the
different vessels; making and calculating observations for determining
the ship’s position, going through all possible manoeuvres and
performing the duties incident to the management of ships in action, in
heavy weather, or in the many emergencies which arise requiring superior
skill in seamanship. They were engaged in instructing the crews in
gunnery, in infantry and sword-drill, and in drill of the battery. They
were also detailed for actual boat service, and for the transferring of
howitzers and marines from ship to shore. During the last cruise Meyer’s
code of signals was used by the graduating class as signal officers, in
communicating from vessel to vessel in the fleet, and instruction was
also given in the Naval Code of signals, and in Navigation throughout
the cruise to all cadets on board. In addition to these cruises the
yacht America, in charge of cadets of this class, as commanding
officers, has been engaged in the performance of despatch-boat duty, and
also special “coast picket duty” in search for the Tallahassee.</p>

<p>The experience of this class&mdash;made up of three advanced sections
of what is now the second class (the graduating class of 1865,) would
seem to indicate, that under a system of appointment that should admit
from the start only those who had maturity of mind and requisite
scholarship, the professional studies of the Academy might be completed
in three years. This is one year longer than the course of the French
Naval School at Brest, the entrance examination of which would exclude
most of the graduates of our Academy.</p>


<h4><a name = "annapolis_rec" id = "annapolis_rec" href =
"#annapolis">III. RECOMMENDATIONS.</a></h4>

<p>The Visitors close their report with the following suggestions, as
the results of their examinations and conferences, in reference to the
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page922" id = "page922">922</a></span>
further development of the Naval Academy and the extension of nautical
education generally, for the consideration of the Department.</p>

<p>I. Until the pupils of the Naval Academy have gone through the
theoretical and practical course of instruction provided in this
institution expressly to qualify them to act as Midshipmen, the Visitors
recommend that they be designated as <i>Naval Cadets</i>&mdash;simply
<i>candidates</i> for the lowest official rank in the Navy&mdash;and
that no cadet be rated as midshipman, no matter how well up he may be in
his studies, until he has had at least eighteen months of professional
practice afloat, towards which time the actual time at sea of each
experimental cruise shall be credited.</p>

<p>II. As the most direct blow to the hindrances which practically
exclude a large portion of the youth of the country, no matter how
strong may be their predilection or great their acquired fitness for the
naval service, from even a chance of being admitted to this national
school;&mdash;as the most effectual preventive of the disappointments
now experienced by individuals and families in the failure of many
appointees to pass the entrance examination, or to meet even the low
requirements of the first year’s course;&mdash;as the only effectual way
of ridding the institution of the low average ability and attainments
which characterize the lower sections of every class, and of bringing up
the talent and scholarship and conduct of the whole corps to the average
of the first two sections;&mdash;as a sure guaranty against the early
resignation of officers educated at the public expense for a life
service in the Navy, and of a progressive and honorable career as long
as life and health last;&mdash;as a powerful attraction to draw to this
department of the public service a fair share of the best talent and
loftiest ambition of the youth of the country, and as a stimulus to
their best efforts for self and school improvement for this
purpose&mdash;the Visitors recommend the immediate abandonment of the
custom of selecting candidates for admission by individual patronage, in
consideration of neighborhood, relationship, or party connection, or the
better motives of the poverty or the public service of parents, and that
all appointments be hereafter made in consideration of the personal
merit of the applicant, ascertained by a public competitive examination,
conducted before an impartial tribunal, constituted as shall be
prescribed by law. Admission, sought and obtained in this way, will be
honorable to the successful candidates, a source of pride to the
neighborhood and State from which they come, a reward to the teachers
who have prepared them, and a stimulus to the industry and good conduct
of their comrades at
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page923" id = "page923">923</a></span>
home. The classes of the Academy, replenished every year by new
recruits, all of whom have sought the service from personal choice and
won their place by personal merit founded on natural aptitude and vigor
of mind and acquired knowledge, and who regard the diligent improvement
of these opportunities of professional study and practice as the true
road to honorable promotion hereafter, to be gained by farther industry
and devotion&mdash;will at once have an average ability and scholarship
equal to that now attained by only five or six out of every one hundred,
and a large proportion of the cases of discipline, the “dead weights,”
the reëxaminations, and the failures from inability, distaste, or want
of preparatory knowledge, will forever disappear from the records of the
Academy.</p>

<p>These suggestions have not the merit of originality nor the
objections of novelty. The principle recommended has stood the test of
seventy years’ trial in France in naval and similar public schools, and
is now in successful operation in England, as well as in most of the
military schools of Europe. It has been again and again urged by
thoughtful friends of this institution and of our other national school
at West Point, as the most effectual remedy for the evils complained of.
The Academic Board of this Academy, in answer to a request from a
committee in 1858 for its opinion on this point, replied:&mdash;“The
Academic Board has long been of the opinion that the present system of
appointing midshipmen without care in their selection, was undermining
the very existence of the institution. The records of the Academy show
that scarcely more than one-fourth of those admitted graduate. The fault
lies with the appointing power, which has not kept the institution
supplied with the proper material, and the Board has been powerless in
applying a remedy. It has done all in its power by recommending a higher
standard of proficiency.” The Visitors for 1862, in the Report of their
examinations, remark:&mdash;“After a careful examination of the subject,
the Board has been forced to the conclusion that the selection of
candidates has not been made with sufficient reference to the wants of
the public service, but has been and continues to be regarded as a
portion of the patronage of the members of Congress making the
nominations. The evil does not stop here; for in many cases, after they
have been appointed without regard to talents or fitness, and have
obtained admission to the institution, and subsequently have been found
incapable to pursue the studies of the class to which they belong, the
influence of the same member of Congress originally nominating them is
successfully used to continue them at the institution, in obtaining
authority for them to recommence their studies by joining a lower class;
thus retaining
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page924" id = "page924">924</a></span>
those wanting in talents and fitness, to the exclusion of others of
suitable qualifications that might be presented. An institution like
this, in which the students are educated and supported by the
government, ought to have them selected from the highest and most
promising youths of the country.”<a class = "tag" name = "tag10_27" id =
"tag10_27" href = "#note10_27">27</a></p>

<p>The same general principle, selection by merit, ascertained by the
same general method, competitive examination, conducted on such
conditions as Congress shall authorize or prescribe, has been
recommended for appointments to the kindred national
institution&mdash;the Military Academy at West Point&mdash;with the view
of removing the same hindrances and remedying the same defects in the
practical working of that school. That eminent military teacher and
administrator, General Thayer, under whom the Academy, notwithstanding
many hindrances and defects, attained its highest development,
recommended the adoption of this principle at the outset of his
administration, after having seen its successful operation in the
military schools of France; and he has recently, after the lapse of
nearly fifty years, all of them spent in actual experience or
observation of the practical results of a different principle, renewed
the recommendation in a communication to the Secretary of War. He has,
within the present year, declared his belief that the adoption at the
start, and the continuous recognition of this principle, the selection
of candidates for admission on the ground of personal merit and aptitude
for the special purposes of the institution, in appointments to the
Military Academy, would have more than doubled its usefulness, would
have avoided most of the difficulties of administration which it has
encountered, would have prevented the popular prejudices which
demagogues and disappointed parents and Congressmen have fostered, and
would have gained for it a larger measure of the popular favor.</p>

<p>The Visitors of the Military Academy for 1863, in their Report
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page925" id = "page925">925</a></span>
to the Secretary of War, go into an extended discussion of the
advantages and objections to this principle and mode of making
appointments. To this document reference is made as embodying the
convictions of this Board as to the probable working of the same
principle in admissions to the Naval Academy.</p>

<p>III. In connection with a change in the mode of appointment, the
Visitors would commend to the consideration of the Department a revision
of the conditions as to the age, bodily vigor, and general knowledge of
candidates. The old system of training naval officers, by placing boys
at the early age of twelve or fourteen years on shipboard in the daily
and constant practice of the routine of the ship, when accompanied with
the parental oversight of the captain as to conduct, and with regular
and progressive instruction in the science and art of his profession, on
ship and shore, by the teacher of mathematics and navigation&mdash;has
produced many capable commanders, out of the larger number who have been
ruined for the want of proper supervision and instruction, or grown up
into men of mere routine. Some of the brightest names in the records of
our own and of the English naval service had no other education or
training than this. But these are the exceptions, and their success was
as much due to opportunity and original genius, as to their early and
continuous ship experience. That system of training officers is,
however, everywhere abandoned, and the present aim of every naval power
in the world is to seek out young men having a fondness for sea-life,
with a generous ambition for naval distinction, with an aptitude for the
sciences which qualify and adorn the naval officer, with vigor of body
to bear the inevitable exposures of the service, and with a large amount
of general knowledge, and then subject them to a special course of
professional study and practice in a naval school. For every stage of
promotion, additional knowledge as well as professional experience,
tested by successive rigid examinations, are required. The experience of
this class of schools indicates that those original qualities and
acquired qualifications deemed indispensable in candidates for the
proper mastery of a thorough course of naval instruction, can not often
be found in young men under eighteen years of age.</p>

<p>IV. With an advance in the average age, maturity of mind, and
preparatory attainments of the cadets on admission, the Visitors believe
a revision and readjustment of the subjects and course of instruction
can be advantageously made, which in connection with the new schools of
naval construction, and of marine engineering, would greatly extend the
range, depth, and practical value of the education of the naval officer,
without prolonging the time now
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page926" id = "page926">926</a></span>
devoted to its acquisition. If the Academy can be relieved of the large
amount of merely elementary general education which every graduate of
the common schools of the country ought to have received, and which in a
few years every aspirant to the privileges of this school would contrive
to get, if the law made its acquisition necessary as a preliminary to a
competitive examination&mdash;then the whole general scientific course
could be mastered in two years, with a large amount of military and
naval tactics, as well as of practical seamanship in the two summer
cruises. At this point the Visitors recommend to the consideration of
the Department the establishment of the following departments, or
schools, in each of which the course of instruction shall be far more
comprehensive and thorough than is now practicable where the branches
constitute parts of a single course:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>First.</i>&mdash;Of Navigation and Seamanship.</p>

<p><i>Second.</i>&mdash;Of Naval Ordnance and Practical Gunnery.</p>

<p><i>Third.</i>&mdash;Of Hydrography, Marine Surveying, Astronomical
Observations, Construction of Charts, &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>Fourth.</i>&mdash;Of Drawing, Naval Designs, Construction of
Ships, Naval Machinery, Docks, &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>Fifth.</i>&mdash;Of Steam and Marine Engineering.</p>

<p><i>Sixth.</i>&mdash;Of Naval History and Strategy, International
Law&mdash;especially of belligerents and neutrals&mdash;and the Law of
the Sea, Consular Duties, &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>Seventh.</i>&mdash;Of Modern Languages.</p>

<p>Into each of these schools let the cadets be drafted, the choice to
be determined by their own predilection or comparative fitness, at the
close of the second year, and after completing such number of these
courses, not less than four, as may be prescribed, let them have the
privilege of an examination.</p>

<p>Each of these departments or schools might be opened to a certain
number of candidates, on competitive examination, from each
State&mdash;no matter where they may have received their
education&mdash;and permission might be given to officers of any rank to
review and extend their knowledge of either of these departments with
the more advanced text-books and means of instruction. By this
arrangement the service will secure the highest development of any
special aptitude, preparation, or experience&mdash;and will more
frequently get “the right man in the right place.”</p>

<p>The importance of these great departments of the naval service, and
of special preparation for them, is fully appreciated by the Academic
Board, but any attempt to give this preparation to all the members of
the present classes, with such unequal and deficient preparatory
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page927" id = "page927">927</a></span>
knowledge and with such diverse aptitudes for particular branches, would
be futile. The attempt to teach as much as is now done, under the
circumstances, only produces confused and unsatisfactory results with a
large portion of the class. The remedy for this state of things seems to
the Visitors to be in:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. More thorough preparation, higher average ability, and greater
maturity of mind on the part of the cadets.</p>

<p>2. A thorough scientific course up to a certain point, for all the
cadets, to occupy two years.</p>

<p>3. The requiring of linguistic training (in one or more modern
languages,) only of those who show some aptitude or previous preparation
for the same.</p>

<p>4. An option of two or three of the above courses, and a thorough
proficiency in those selected before being permitted to pass as
midshipman.</p>

<p>5. And finally continuation of study as well as of practice after
graduation in the directions for which there is a demonstrated fitness
and ability.</p>

<p>V. The Visitors deem it desirable to concentrate in and around the
Naval Academy the largest amount and the highest quality of teaching
ability, naval experience, and the apparatus and opportunities of
practice of every kind connected with the naval service. But they would
also commend to the consideration of the Department the encouragement of
Naval Institutes, or temporary courses of instruction, at suitable
seasons of the year, in some of the great departments of naval education
specified in the foregoing classification&mdash;for the benefit of
officers on furlough, or connected with the National Dockyards and
Depositories, especially those in the neighborhood of large collegiate
institutions, on the request of a certain number of such officers.
Private naval architects and shipmasters might also be invited to attend
these Institutes. Something of this kind should be provided, especially
if continued study and examination is required by law and regulation at
every stage of promotion in the naval service.</p>

<p>VI. The absence of elementary naval schools and of any regular
instruction in navigation, the want of nationality and the low condition
of the seaman-class generally, prevents any considerable demonstration
or recognition of that nautical taste and aptitude for sea-life in the
great mass of the population, which ought to be the basis of all special
nautical training. To remedy this state of things, to develope and
cultivate, where it exists, a desire for a maritime career, to provide
at once a supply of intelligent, hardy, and well-trained seamen, mates,
and masters, for the national as
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page928" id = "page928">928</a></span>
well as for the commercial marine, in time of peace as well as in the
emergencies of a sudden Or a great war, the Visitors recommend the
inauguration, under the auspices of the Naval Department, of a system of
navigation schools and naval instruction, in addition to and in
connection with our present system of naval apprenticeship, commensurate
with the demands of the service, the country, and the age. As the basis
of this system, they recommend the immediate offer of pecuniary aid to
encourage the establishment of a class of navigation schools in all the
large seaports of the country, subject to thorough national inspection
in order to secure uniformity and efficiency. They do not deem it
necessary to consider here the organization, management, and instruction
of this class of schools, farther than to present the outline of a
system.</p>

<p>1. The schools which they contemplate, are not to be government
schools&mdash;although they will be aided and inspected by the Naval
Department. Their original establishment, buildings, material,
equipment, and immediate management will belong to the local Board of
Trade or Commerce representing the shipping and commercial interests of
the communities in which they are located. Through such Board, the State
or municipal authorities, or individuals, can extend pecuniary aid for
the original outfit or annual support.</p>

<p>2. The objects aimed at in the internal constitution of the schools
and classes, will be thorough instruction in navigation, seamanship, and
kindred branches through:&mdash;<i>First</i>&mdash;Evening classes for
adults, (seamen, mates, or masters,) who can not attend regularly on
account of absence from port or engagements by day, in which the
instruction will necessarily be elementary and fragmentary;
<i>Second</i>&mdash;A junior department or division, in which
instruction in arithmetic, drawing, commercial geography, and
statistics, will be given, as well as in navigation, the use of
instruments, calculation of observations, keeping a log-book, journal,
&amp;c.; <i>Third</i>&mdash;A senior department, in which a thorough
course of mathematics, navigation, nautical astronomy, steam and steam
navigation, &amp;c., will be given, with facilities for acquiring one or
more of the languages of the nations with which we have large commercial
dealings.</p>

<p>3. The extension of any government aid should be based on the
condition that suitable buildings and material equipment are furnished
and kept in repair and working order by the local Board, or committee of
the same, charged with the immediate management of the school; and such
aid shall be subject to reduction and withdrawal for the succeeding year
on the recommendation of the Department inspectors. For the first year
the only condition should be the actual payment, from other sources, of
an equal amount for
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page929" id = "page929">929</a></span>
the annual expense of the school, subject to the disposal of the local
Board. For the second and subsequent years, the sum paid by the
government shall be appropriated in portions; <i>First</i>&mdash;a
specific sum to the principal teacher and assistants according to the
grade of certificated qualification each may hold; <i>Second</i>&mdash;a
specific sum to the managers of each school for the annual expense of
the same, according the average daily or evening attendance of the whole
number enrolled in each class or division for a specified period of time
in each year; <i>Third</i>&mdash;a specific sum to the managers of each
school according to the number of pupils who shall complete certain
specified courses of study to the satisfaction of the inspectors upon
examination by them; <i>Fourth</i>&mdash;a specified sum in prizes, in
the form of chronometers, sextants, text-books in navigation, &amp;c.,
to be competed for by all the pupils of each division of a school;
<i>Fifth</i>&mdash;a specified sum in aid of such professional
experience as can be secured for the younger members of the school, as
is now given to naval apprentices. All payments by the government should
be so made as to secure and reward the services of able and faithful
teachers, the regular, punctual, and prolonged attendance of pupils to
the completion of each course which they enter, and the liberal
coöperation of the local municipal authorities and the commercial and
shipping portions of the community in which the school is located.
Without such coöperation the whole plan will fail. The school need not
be free&mdash;but let the instruction be good, practical, and cheap, and
its possessor be sure of a lucrative employment, and then there will be
a demand for it.</p>

<p>And why should not the national government enter upon this or a
better devised system of training its own seamen, and advancing its
naval and commercial interests? All maritime nations, either directly
and exclusively by the central government, or through local boards of
trade and commerce, have aimed to protect the lives and property of
citizens engaged in commerce and navigation, by providing not only for
the erection of light houses, buoys, and other material safeguards, but
also by an adequate supply of competent pilots and mariners, duly
trained and commissioned. Our own government has recognized its duty in
all these respects, and in the recent enormous expansion and peculiar
risks of the steam-marine, has established a system of inspection which
is intended to reach every engine used for the propulsion of every
vessel of any class in all waters subject to national law. Surely the
same policy which permits and justifies this interference of the
national arm and the application of the national resources to build
light-houses, erect buoys, register the names, tonnage, and ownership of
vessels;
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page930" id = "page930">930</a></span>
which commissions pilots, inspects steam-boilers, surveys harbors, makes
observations of the stars, the currents of the ocean and the prevalent
directions of the winds in different seasons and latitudes; constructs
and circulates maps and charts, and does all these things for the
protection of commerce and for the use of the navy, will, in behalf of
the same great interests, when satisfied that they are jeopardized by
present neglect, see and be assured that the masters, mates, and seamen,
who have all the precious lives and enormous properties embarked in
commerce in their keeping, are properly trained in the science and art
of navigation.</p>

<p>The liberal educational policy of the national government which has
set apart over one hundred millions of acres of the national domain for
educational purposes, which if the right of inspection into its
application had been asserted and exercised, would have amounted ere
this time to a permanent fund of over five hundred millions of
dollars&mdash;and which has more recently appropriated over six hundred
thousand acres of public land for the establishment of agricultural and
scientific schools;&mdash;the similar policy of the State governments,
that holds all property subject to taxation for the support of schools,
and that authorizes the most munificent appropriations for free public
schools in all of the large cities, which are also the great seaports of
the country&mdash;all justify the belief that a system of education for
this large class of the community, once fairly entered upon by the
national government, will be cheerfully and liberally responded to and
sustained.</p>

<p>In England the same necessity which exists in this country&mdash;the
reluctance of young people in good circumstances, to enter the maritime
service&mdash;the low state of the professional as well as general
education of her seaman-class&mdash;the enormous amount of property and
the large number of lives directly interested in commerce and
navigation&mdash;the reliance for properly manning the national vessels
in the sudden emergency of war, on the commercial marine&mdash;the
representative character which mariners bear, of the religion, manners,
and civilization generally of the country, to all nations which they
visit&mdash;the desire for the elevation of this large class of the
population in intelligence, morality, and physical well-being, for its
own sake as well as for the happiness, safety, and glory of the whole
country&mdash;has prompted the government to organize a system of
nautical education, not only for officers, gunners, architects,
shipwrights, engineers, seamen, and boys employed directly in the
national service, but for the masters, mates, sailors, and boys in her
large commercial marine. Prior to 1853, the whole reliance of that
country for the professional education of masters and mates was their
registration
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page931" id = "page931">931</a></span>
after an examination in the mere mechanical knowledge of navigation and
seamanship. To obtain this knowledge, reliance was placed on the
economic law of supply and demand, and in this case as in others of an
intellectual and moral nature, the least demand was made by those in the
greatest want. Only here and there, in the great seaport towns,
individuals poorly qualified in most instances, opened schools and
classes of navigation, in which instruction of the most elementary and
mechanical character was given without system, to a very small number,
and without supervision or responsibility. In 1853, after the great
International Exhibition had demonstrated the superiority of France and
other continental nations, in the scientific as well as artistic
training of their industrial classes, the English Government constituted
a Department of Art and Science to administer a large appropriation
(amounting annually to nearly a half-million of dollars) so as to extend
encouragement to local institutions of practical science scattered in
all the principal centers of population, and acting in every department
of industry, all subject to the visits of government inspectors. To this
Department of Science and Art was assigned the extension of pecuniary
encouragement to, and the inspection of a class of schools which had
been instituted by the Mercantile Marine Department of the
(governmental) Board of Trade, in connection with local boards of
commerce and trade, for the benefit of the navigation interests of the
country. These schools in 1863 had increased to eighteen&mdash;each in
an important seaport&mdash;each under the management of a local
committee&mdash;each having a fair attendance of boys, seamen, mates,
and masters, who all paid small fees. The system is still in its
infancy, but continues to enjoy the confidence of the government and of
the large commercial houses.</p>

<p>Nor is this system of governmental aid and inspection of marine and
navigation schools, confined to England. In all the continental states
in which the commerce is large enough to require the aid of government
in any form for its protection, as well as for the indirect advantage of
the navy, this class of schools exists&mdash;and in some the national
policy in this respect is most comprehensive and thorough. In France,
the government in its gigantic efforts within the last twenty-five years
to establish a navy which in the number, design, construction, and
armament of its vessels, in the scientific and professional knowledge of
the officers, and the practical intelligence of her seaman, should be
equal to that of any other nation&mdash;has included the whole
commercial marine in its operations. Encouragement is given to private
shipyards, architects, and founderies; and the system of maritime
“inscription” or enrollment is
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page932" id = "page932">932</a></span>
so thorough that there is not a master nor an engineer in the commercial
service who has not served at least two years in the national dockyards,
founderies, or ships, and enjoyed opportunities of professional study,
as well as practice, of the most scientific character.</p>

<p>VII. To give unity, stability, thoroughness, and general efficiency
to the inspection and operations of the large system of naval education
contemplated in the foregoing suggestions, the Visitors recommend the
appointment of a Council or Board of Naval Education, in the
constitution of which the great features of such a system should be
represented, viz.:&mdash;(1.) Experience and success in naval command.
(2.) Experience in large commercial and maritime affairs. (3.) Success
in naval construction. (4.) Success in the instruction and discipline of
educational institutions. (5.) A&nbsp;new infusion every year of the
popular element, by the appointment from year to year of one or more
public-spirited citizens from different sections of the country to
attend the local examinations of applicants for admission, and the
annual examinations of the several institutions.</p>

<p>To this Board should be assigned the duty of (1.) Frequent personal
inspection and examination at other than stated periods. (2.) The
thorough examination by themselves, and in connection with the
professors, of the several classes in their daily recitations. (3.) The
examination by themselves, or by competent experts, of all candidates
for admission, of which as far as practicable, the written answers of
the candidates should be preserved, and a written report in detail
should be filed away for reference.</p>

<p>The language used in the law under which the present Board of
Visitors are appointed&mdash;“for the purpose of <i>witnessing</i> the
examination of the several classes”&mdash;if taken literally, would
certainly justify the practice adopted by this, and as far as they can
learn, by previous Boards. At all events, the constitution of this and
previous Boards, composed as it is of members a majority of whom have
had no experience in school examinations&mdash;who have had no
acquaintance with this institution before their present
appointment&mdash;and who are together for but a short period of time,
is very inadequate for any purpose of thorough personal examination.
They must be satisfied in the main to receive statements on trust, and
to receive and communicate only general impressions. All the duties
devolving upon the Board of Visitors as at present organized, could be
far more efficiently and successfully performed in connection with the
other duties of the Council of Naval Education, here suggested.</p>

<p>VIII. With a programme of studies so extensive as that now laid
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page933" id = "page933">933</a></span>
down or as herein proposed, in which each study is, or should be
arranged with reference to what has gone before, as well as to what is
to follow, the professor of each department and the teacher of each
branch and section, should be kept closely to his portion, each cadet
should master thoroughly every step in the succession, no professor
should encroach upon the time of another, no teacher should be allowed
to pass his pupils indifferently prepared into the succeeding section or
branch. Even if no change be made in the present programme this course
is essential to the success of the school, and to secure this an
Inspector of Studies should be appointed, who should report frequently
to the Academic Board all and every infraction of the programme, so that
it may be ascertained whether the cause of failure be in the programme,
or the class, or the teacher; and the remedy at once applied. Both the
special and general duties of the Commandant preclude the constant and
minute inspection referred to, and to the professor of no one department
can these duties be properly assigned. While there is a superior
executive officer who has in charge the external administration of the
affairs of the Academy, there is no corresponding officer, as in the
opinion of the Visitors there should be, to preside over the vital
matters of instruction and training.</p>

<p>IX. The appointment of professors and assistants is a subject from
its importance at all times, and from its immediate bearing upon the
welfare of the school, deserving of mature consideration. The efficiency
and thoroughness of instruction, the spirit of diligent study and the
enthusiastic love of it among the midshipmen, depend to a great degree,
upon the fitness of the instructor for his post and the method and
manner of teaching which he employs. Though there may be some reason for
limiting their appointment to the graduates of the Academy, yet the
present course of instruction has by no means in view the training of
future teachers, nor has it yet reached its full development. The
success and advancement of the institution would seem to require the
employment of the best educational talent, and none other, to be
obtained wherever it can be found. Whenever any vacancy is to be filled,
or new appointments to be made, the Visitors recommend that due notice
of the same be given, and that the credentials of all applicants be
referred to a competent board, and the applicants themselves whose
credentials are satisfactory, be subjected to an open, competitive
examination.</p>

<p>X. In conclusion, the Visitors recommend that greater publicity be
given to all the documents which set forth the object
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page934" id = "page934">934</a></span>
and operations of the Naval Academy, the mode and conditions of
nominating midshipmen, the name of the person responsible for a
nomination, the requisitions and results of each entrance as well as of
all annual examinations, with specimens of the questions asked and
answers given, so far as the same were written or printed. They would
respectfully urge that the Official Register of the Academy, with the
above and other information deemed necessary by the Department, be sent
not only to every member of Congress, but to the libraries of all
principal High Schools, public and private, and all institutions where
candidates are prepared, that both teachers and pupils may know what the
Department requires as preliminary to the special professional training
provided in this Academy for any branch of the naval service of the
country, and especially how deplorably deficient a large proportion of
the candidates are found to be, on only a moderately strict but
impartial examination. To this Register might be appended the official
report of the Bureau charged with its supervision, or of any Board of
Visitors, or Special Examiners, appointed by the Department.</p>

<p>With the best permanent accommodations and equipment of the Academy
that can be made at Annapolis or elsewhere&mdash;with schools or courses
of scientific and practical instruction for every branch of the service,
and for every stage of promotion&mdash;with a teaching staff so numerous
and so diversified as to secure the advantage of special attainment and
qualifications to each branch of study&mdash;with entire control of the
pupil’s time&mdash;with hospital accommodations and medical services for
the sick&mdash;with chaplains for religious observances and the moral
culture of all&mdash;with regular alternations of physical exercise and
intellectual labor, and the stimulus of an honorable distinction before
and after graduation&mdash;the Visitors think it not unreasonable to
expect from an institution so provided for, the highest results,
especially as the government has it in its power to select for
admission, without regard to the social or political status of parents,
from among the entire youth of the country, those who are best fitted by
their physical and mental endowment and preliminary education, as well
as by their aptitude for special studies and predilection for the naval
service, for which those studies are a preparation.</p>

<p>All which is respectfully submitted.</p>

<p>The aggregate expense of the Military Academy at West Point, and the

specific sums which appear in the annual appropriation for the military
and naval service, but is increased by the large sums paid to officers
and men who are detailed to these posts for police, instructional, and
other purposes of these institutions. The cost to the government of each
cadet from his admission to his graduation in either Academy, exceeds
$10,000.</p>

<p>Under authority of an Act of Congress (July 4, 1864), the Secretary
of the Navy, in 1865, made provision at Annapolis for a course of
instruction for a class of Assistant-Engineers, composed of persons
admitted on competitive examination, many of whom had secured a
preliminary scientific training, and all of whom gave evidence of
aptitude for such occupation and of having had experience in the
fabrication of steam machinery. There was every indication of a special
school for this department of the naval service, when the enterprise was
suspended; but to be revived under the following Regulations, issued by
Secretary Robeson, April 4, 1871:</p>


<p class = "smallhead"><a name = "navy_engineer_cadet" id =
"navy_engineer_cadet" href = "#navy_engineer">REGULATIONS FOR THE
APPOINTMENT OF CADET ENGINEERS.</a></p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>I. In pursuance of the third and fourth sections of an act passed at
the first session of the 38th Congress, approved July 4, 1864, “<i>To
authorize the Secretary of the Navy to provide for the education of
Naval Constructors and Engineers, and for other purposes</i>,” and of
the second section of an act passed at the first session of the 39th
Congress, approved March 2, 1867, entitled, “<i>An Act to amend certain
acts in relation to the Navy</i>,” applications will be received by the
Navy Department for the appointment of Cadet Engineers.</p>

<p>II. The application is to be addressed to the Secretary of the Navy,
and can be made by the candidate, or by any person for him, and his name
will be placed on the register. The registry of a name gives no
assurance of an appointment, and no preference will be given in the
selection to priority of application.</p>

<p>III. The number of Cadet Engineers is limited by law to fifty. The
candidate must be not less than eighteen nor more than twenty-two years
of age; he will be required to certify <i>on honor</i> to his precise
age, to the Academic Board, previous to his examination, and no one will
be examined who is over or under the prescribed age. His application
must be accompanied by satisfactory evidence of moral character and
health, with information regarding date of birth and educational
advantages hitherto enjoyed. Candidates who receive permission will
present themselves to the Superintendent of the Naval Academy between
the 15th and 25th of September for examination as to their
qualifications.</p>

<p>IV. The course of study will comprise two academic years. All Cadets
who graduate will be warranted as Assistant Engineers in the Navy. The
pay of a Cadet Engineer is the same as that of a Cadet Midshipman.</p>

<p>V. The academic examination previous to appointment will be on the
following subjects, namely: <i>Arithmetic</i>: the candidate will be
examined in numeration and the addition, subtraction, multiplication,
and division of whole numbers, and of vulgar and decimal fractions; in
reduction; in proportion or rule of three, direct and inverse;
extraction of square and cube roots. In <i>Algebra</i>, (Bourdon’s,)
through equations of the first degree. In <i>Geometry</i>, (Davies’
Legendre,) through the plane figures. <i>Rudimentary Natural Philosophy.
Reading</i>: he must read clearly and intelligibly from any English
narrative work, as, for example, Bancroft’s History of the United
States. In <i>Writing</i> and <i>Spelling</i>: he must write from
dictation, in a legible hand, and spell with correctness, both orally
and in writing. In English <i>Grammar</i> and English <i>Composition</i>
he will be examined as to the parts of speech, the rules connected
therewith, and the elementary construction of sentences, and will be
required to write such original paragraphs as will show that he has a
proper knowledge of the subject. The candidate will also be required to
exhibit a fair degree of proficiency in pencil-sketching, and to produce
satisfactory evidence of mechanical aptitude. Candidates
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page938" id = "page938">938</a></span>
who possess greatest skill and experience in the practical knowledge of
machinery, other qualifications being equal, shall have precedence for
admission.</p>

<p>VI. Any of the following conditions will be sufficient to reject a
candidate.</p>

<p>Feeble constitution, permanently impaired general health, decided
cachexia, all chronic diseases or injuries that permanently impair
efficiency, viz:</p>

<p>1. Infectious disorders.</p>

<p>2. Weak or disordered intellect.</p>

<p>3. Unnatural curvature of spine.</p>

<p>4. Epilepsy, or other convulsion, within five years.</p>

<p>5. Chronic impaired vision, or chronic disease of the organs of
vision.</p>

<p>6. Great permanent hardness of hearing, or chronic disease of the
ears.</p>

<p>7. Loss or decay of teeth to such an extent as to interfere with
digestion and impair health.</p>

<p>8. Impediment of speech to such an extent as to impair efficiency in
the performance of duty.</p>

<p>9. Decided indications of liability to pulmonary disease.</p>

<p>10. Permanent inefficiency of either of the extremities.</p>

<p>11. Hernia.</p>

<p>12. Incurable sarcocele, hydrocele, fistula, stricture, or
hæmorrhoids.</p>

<p>13. Large varicose veins of lower limbs. Chronic ulcers.</p>

<p>14. Attention will also be paid to the stature of the candidate, and
no one <i>manifestly</i> undersized for his age will be received into
the Academy. In case of doubt about the physical condition of the
candidate any marked deviation from the usual standard of height will
add materially to the consideration for rejection.</p>

<p>15. The Board will exercise a proper discretion in the application of
the above conditions to each case, rejecting no candidate who is likely
to be efficient in the service, and admitting no one who is likely to
prove physically inefficient.</p>

<p>VII. If both these examinations result favorably, the candidate will
receive an appointment as a Cadet Engineer, become an inmate of the
Academy, and will be allowed his actual and necessary traveling expenses
from his residence to the Naval Academy, and be required to sign
articles by which he will bind himself to serve in the United States
Navy six years, (including his term of probation at the Naval Academy,)
unless sooner discharged. If, on the contrary, he shall not pass both of
these examinations, he will receive neither an appointment nor his
traveling expenses, nor can he have the privilege of another examination
for admission <i>to the same class</i> unless recommended by the
Board.</p>

<p>VIII. When candidates shall have passed the required examinations,
and been admitted as members of the Academy, they must immediately
furnish themselves with the following articles, viz:</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>One navy-blue uniform suit,</p>

<p class = "smallhead">INTRODUCTION.</p>

<p><span class = "firstword">Under</span> the constitutional powers “to
regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the several States,”
and “to provide and maintain a navy,” Congress, it is believed, can do
more than is now done to provide both the military and commercial marine
with intelligent, hardy and skillful sailors, as well as mates and
captains, and to elevate the position of the whole seamen class.</p>

<p>The frightful accidents from explosions caused by badly constructed,
or worn out steam-boilers, led to a system of national inspection which
has done something to diminish the loss of life and property from this
source, in vessels engaged in commerce on the ocean or our inland
waters&mdash;but a system of instruction, examination, and promotion,
under national authority, with national aid and the cöoperation of the
mercantile community, of all persons intrusted with the command and
navigation of all vessels, registered as national shipping, would put an
end to all that class of disasters to life and property which is now
attributable <i>to ignorance and want of experience</i>&mdash;and which
is regarded by underwriters as much the largest portion of all marine
disasters.</p>

<p>The necessity of doing something led to the establishment of the
naval apprentice system, under the Act of March 2, 1837.</p>

<p>The original trial was not inaugurated under favorable conditions,
and was prematurely abandoned, under the economical action of Congress
which compelled the department to elect between men and boys for its
arduous service. In 1864 the system was revived by Secretary Welles, a
vessel was placed under the command of a competent officer, and a
promising class of boys, after a preliminary examination were enlisted,
and the work of their instruction was begun by training them in all the
details of a sailor’s duty at sea. The Secretary in his Report for 1866,
expressed himself hopeful of the results&mdash;but urged Congress to
further legislation, to make the system attractive, by holding out to
the most deserving members of the class, appointments to the Naval
Academy, and a retiring pension after twenty years’ service. His
suggestions were not heeded, and under the limitations of the Act of
1866 the trial failed.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page940" id = "page940">940</a></span>
<p>Commodore Jenkins, Chief of the Bureau of Navigation, having
cognizance of Naval Apprentices, in his Report for 1866, remarks:</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>A judicious naval apprentice system will secure to the navy every
year, after the first enlisted boys are thoroughly trained and educated,
a sufficient number of well-disciplined and better instructed seamen to
give tone and character to the crews of our vessels of war than
heretofore, and if the enlistments were unlimited it would require only
a few years to provide all the seamen necessary for a formidable naval
peace establishment.</p>

<p>But it is not the navy alone that is or ought to be greatly
interested in the success of the naval apprentice system. Every
ship-owner and shipper in the country will be directly or indirectly
benefited as well as the navy. Many of the apprentices will, at the
expiration of their apprenticeship, seek service on board of merchant
vessels, where the advantages of their previous training and education
will be felt.</p>

<p>If there were training-ships in every port of the United States for
apprentices to the sea service, and the apprentices, after being taught
the rudiments of an English education and all the seamanship that could
be taught on board of a vessel in port, were sent on long sea voyages,
the seamen of the country would soon become more elevated in character
than they are at present, and ship-owners would realize the importance
of cherishing and protecting a valuable class of our countrymen who are
now left to the tender mercies of hard-hearted landlords, crimps, and
runners.</p>

<p>It is a great mistake to suppose that steam vessels can be managed
well by landsmen at sea. The terrible shipwrecks, loss of numbers of
individuals, and of millions of dollars’ worth of property annually on
the ocean, is in the main attributable to bad management, ignorance, and
want of experience of those in charge of the vessels. It is as necessary
that sea steamers should be officered and manned by expert seamen as it
was in former times for clipper and other sailing vessels. A&nbsp;good
knowledge of seamanship is only to be acquired by a long apprenticeship;
nor does the ability to navigate a vessel from one port to another make
a man a seaman. There is no vocation, profession, or calling which
requires a more varied knowledge and a greater experience than that of
an expert seaman. It is not sufficient that he should know how to knot
and splice a rope, to reef and furl a sail, to take his trick at the
helm, or to give correct soundings in heaving the lead. He must be a
good judge of the appearances of the weather, know how to lay his vessel
to and under what canvas for safety, on what tack to put his vessel to
avoid the strength of the approaching gale or hurricane, when to run and
when to lie to, and he must be fertile in resources to save his vessel
in case of danger or disaster at sea. The expert seaman is a man full of
resources, and ever ready to turn his knowledge and experience to good
account; but such is not the estimate of him by those who only know him
as an outcast of society, without friends and without influence.</p>

<p>As education and careful training elevate those who are engaged in
the different pursuits on shore, the same means, if judiciously
employed, will elevate and make useful and respectable in their sphere
that much neglected and greatly oppressed class of our
fellow-citizens&mdash;the American sailor.</p>

<p class = "heading"><i>Navigation Schools for the Mercantile
Marine.</i></p>

<p>Whatever may be the success of still another trial of the apprentice
system to secure a supply of trained seamen for the Navy, the experience
of all other countries is decidedly in favor of a liberal system of
Navigation Schools, as well as an efficient system of registration,
examination, and certificates of competency and of service, administered
under national inspection and with pecuniary aid, and under the local
management of merchants, ship-owners, and underwriters, for the
commercial marine.</p>

agitation of naval education in England has elicited.</p>


<p class = "heading"><i>Proposed Improvements in Naval Education in
England.</i></p>

<p>In 1869, the alternative was offered, on their own petition, to the
2,710 disabled seamen, who resided in the truly magnificent Hospital at
Greenwich, on the Thames, which the national gratitude had set apart for
their accommodation, when no longer able from wounds, age, or other
infirmities to serve under “the meteor flag” of England&mdash;to
continue there at the expense of the government, or draw their pensions
and spend it in their own way, among their friends in their old homes,
or wherever they fancied; only 31 elected to remain&mdash;and these were
too feeble to leave, or had outlived their friends. The old Hospital
infirmary, a large detached building, was granted by the Admiralty to
the Seamen’s Hospital Society for the benefit of the mercantile marine;
but the bulk of that immense pile&mdash;which is covered in by seven
acres of roof, and whose domes and colonnades were designed by Sir
Christopher Wren, and erected at a cost, from first to last, of not less
than a million sterling&mdash;full of historic associations as the
birthplace of Queen Elizabeth, and the residence of two dynasties of
English kings, and the greater Lord Protector Oliver Cromwell, and for
two centuries the home of the British Navy&mdash;for nearly two years
has stood vacant. The <span class = "smallcaps">Times</span>, in an
editorial of September 13, 1871, renews a suggestion made at the time
the system of out pensions was under discussion, to continue its use for
the Navy.</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>It is almost two years since we hazarded the suggestion that it
should be converted into a Naval University. We used the term
“University” in the sense of a collective institution, embracing several
separate Colleges adapted to a similar purpose. We pointed out how
inadequate in extent and in range of education is the present Royal
Naval College at Portsmouth, the only institution we possess for
supplying to Naval Officers what is termed a “higher education.” We also
reminded our readers that the education of our Naval Cadets between the
ages of 12 and 14 is now carried on in a School-ship, which, from the
nature of things, must have many disadvantages in comparison with a
building of ample space on the brink of a great river and on the border
of a
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page942" id = "page942">942</a></span>
Royal Park. We showed that there was already a great Charity-School in
the rear of the Hospital, and supported by its funds, for the gratuitous
education of 800 children of poor sailors; and we reckoned that the
Hospital would still supply ample accommodation for a scheme, suggested
to us on high authority, for furnishing at cost price to the children of
seamen of all grades in the Navy and Commercial Marine, an education in
English, French, the elements of science, and the ordinary rudiments of
instruction.</p>

<p>In the year 1870 the Admiralty appointed a committee on “the Higher
Education of Naval Officers,” and directed them to consider whether it
was desirable to limit the place of study to the College at Portsmouth,
or whether the vacant buildings at Greenwich could be utilized for the
purposes of education. The reported evidence of the Committee revealed a
lamentable want of scientific knowledge in the naval profession. The
witnesses were agreed in stating that few half-pay Officers had
knowledge enough to study with advantage after the age of 30, and that
few could, with advantage to the service and themselves, be spared to
study before the age of 30.&nbsp;It was stated by the Mathematical
Master that Commanders and Captains come to the College very badly
prepared, and that “some come who are unable to work a decimal
fraction.” They come, as the College is now organized, exclusively for
scientific study, in which Mathematics are a necessity, and yet are
destitute of the most elementary preparation. Of course there are a few
brilliant exceptions, but the scientific attainments of the profession
as a body appear to be deplorably low.</p>

<p>In preparing a scheme for the improvement of what is so modestly
termed “the higher education” of Naval Officers, the Committee proposed
to add to the voluntary subjects of study a considerable number of
practical pursuits. They proposed, under the advice of the late Chief
Constructor of the Navy, to add both a short and a long course in Naval
Architecture, in which there is at present absolutely no instruction
given to Naval Officers. Such an education was supplied between the
years 1806 and 1821, but since the latter year it has been altogether
ignored and discouraged. It would require considerable space for the
exhibition of models, and no sufficient room exists for it in the
present College in Portsmouth Dockyard. The Committee proposed to
furnish instruction, as now, in Steam, Mathematics, Nautical Astronomy,
and Field Fortification, but to add facilities for the study of
Languages, Chemistry, including Metallurgy, Geology, Mineralogy, and
Naval Tactics. The want of a knowledge of languages in the British Navy
was signally illustrated on a somewhat recent occasion, when the French
iron-clad fleet visited Spithead, and upon our Admiral signalling for
all officers who could speak French to come on board the Flagship, only
one officer in the Channel Fleet was able to respond to the summons. The
want of a scientific knowledge of the principles of naval architecture
has prevented of late many skilled seamen of the Royal Navy from
contributing useful and practicable suggestions to the discussions on
our ironclad ship-building. The Committee seem to have thought that it
would not be practicable to make a year’s study in the Naval College in
peace time compulsory for every sub-lieutenant, though distinguished
officers, like Admiral Sir Alexander Milne, gave evidence in favor of
it. But, apart from this abundant source for supplying students, it was
anticipated that an extension of the education would attract a large
increase of scholars; and on general grounds, quite distinct from the
accommodation, one-half of the Committee, including the Director of
Naval Education, were strongly in favor of establishing the College at
Greenwich. Fortified by this concurrence of authority, we recommend
again to the consideration of the Government the scheme of a Naval
University as the best mode of repeopling that ancient and now vacant
Hospital.</p>
</div>

<p>This “leader” of the Times was followed in the issue for Sept. 20, by
a communication from the eminent ship-builder E.&nbsp;J. Reed, who was
for several years at the head of the Department of Naval
Construction&mdash;with reasons for immediately widening and raising the
education of naval officers of all classes.</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>The absence of everything like a comprehensive organization for
imparting
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page943" id = "page943">943</a></span>
to them the knowledge necessary in these days is truly deplorable, and
is made the more so by the very fact that our officers are themselves
well aware of the extreme defectiveness of their training in many
branches of knowledge which would be most valuable to them, and exhibit
the strongest desire to supplement that training by every available
means. I&nbsp;have had many occasions of observing this during the last
few years; not the least striking of them being the publication of my
book on <i>Shipbuilding in Iron and Steel</i>, which, although a purely
technical and professional book, was eagerly procured and studied by a
very large number of naval officers, who, as you justly state, are now
left absolutely without any official instruction in naval architecture.
When in Russia this year I found elaborate means and appliances for
instructing young officers in all the great features of practical
shipbuilding, as well as in the general principles of naval design, and
I had the opportunity of examining a large model of an iron-clad ship
which was being constructed by these young naval officers; while the
shipbuilding and engineering officers of the Russian service have one
entire side of the vast building which accommodates the Admiralty
branches, wholly devoted to their instruction. I&nbsp;have not yet seen
the naval training schools of Germany, but I have had several
opportunities of conferring on shipbuilding questions with the naval
officers of that country, and I can state with perfect confidence that
they possess a most intimate acquaintance with even the latest methods
of naval design and construction, and obviously have had a careful
training in the principles of naval architecture and the details of
shipbuilding. How much this training contributes to the efficiency of
naval commanders and other officers I need not say.</p>
</div>

<p>Mr. Reed dwells on the total absence of even an attempt to instruct
naval officers of all ranks in the department of construction.</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>Even our warrant officers, the “carpenters” of the Navy, whose duty
it is to keep our Navy in repair at sea, and to take instant measures
for saving our ships from the effects of injuries sustained by
collisions, groundings, or during action&mdash;even these officers are
subjected to no special and organized training whatever, and are often
put on board ship, in responsible charge of the repairing staff, without
any knowledge whatever of the construction of their vessel.</p>

<p>I knew so well that the whole class of naval “carpenters” have for
years been anxious to obtain a better training for their very
responsible duty, that I made a vigorous effort to be allowed to
organize a system by which every carpenter of the service should be
carefully instructed in iron shipbuilding, and as carefully selected for
particular ships on account of his fitness for the duty; but some
tradition about warrant officers being “executive officers,” and
therefore not under the Chief Constructor of the Navy, and also,
I&nbsp;fear, some jealousy of the patronage of such appointments passing
into new hands, effectually barred my progress, and imposed conditions
under which it was not possible to give effect to my wishes.</p>

<p>I do not think I shall go beyond the truth if I say that other
warrant officers are as deficient of suitable training as carpenters.
I&nbsp;have certainly known of more than one instance in which the
machinery by which our great modern guns are worked at sea has been so
imperfectly understood that the “breaks” which are intended to control
them have been “greased;” and no doubt a war would <ins class =
"correction" title = "spelling unchanged">develope</ins> sad
consequences of the enforced ignorance of our gunners.</p>

<p>But let it not be supposed that I advocate the instruction of warrant
officers alone in the principles and practice of shipbuilding; it is in
my judgment pressingly desirable that the whole class of executive
officers should be afforded a certain amount of training in these
subjects, and a far ampler training than they now receive in many other
subjects also. The Navy suffers very much, even in peace times, from the
want of a more liberal training on the part of its officers, as they
themselves well know; and I am thoroughly persuaded that in a time of
war we shall have to make great sacrifices on account of our neglect in
this respect. Many unwise things are done, and many unwise reports are
written, because of the want of fuller scientific and technical
information on the part of naval officers; and I do not hesitate to say
that during my tenure of the Chief Constructorship serious evils arose
in my own department from the outside pressure of the uninformed.</p>
</div>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page944" id = "page944">944</a></span>
<p>Mr. Reed would locate the Naval University at Greenwich.</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>Such a University must almost of a necessity be metropolitan. All the
provincial Government Schools of Naval Architecture in this country have
failed, and always must fail, because the metropolis alone can supply
the necessary professors for class education chiefly of a scientific
character; and the same is even more true of the present case. All the
civil members of the late Admiralty Committee on the higher education of
naval officers concurred in this view, none more strongly,
I&nbsp;believe, than the present Director of Admiralty Education, Dr.
Joseph Woolley, who is undoubtedly at once the most experienced and most
enlightened authority alive as regards all questions of naval training.
And there is this very strong further reason for making this University
metropolitan&mdash;viz., that one of the most fruitful and valuable
results to be anticipated from a more liberal and enlarged education of
our naval officers is the release of the service from those thousand and
one Old World prejudices which cramp the action and spirit of the
service in these modern days, when other nations are bringing their most
free and cultivated minds to bear upon naval warfare; and to found a
University in a port where the present traditions and habits of thought
of the service have the greatest force, would be to place a fatal
stumbling block at the very threshold of the work; and if the metropolis
is to be the home of the University there can not be a doubt about the
superior eligibility of Greenwich. There the magnificent college already
stands, with its empty halls, inviting the Government to devote them to
some great national and naval object. It is within easy reach of London,
professors and teachers; it is in the neighborhood of great shipbuilding
and marine engine-making establishments, and also of Chatham Dockyard.
It is on the banks of our noblest river, and on the verge of the open
country, so that every form of healthful recreation would be available
for the students. It also affords ample internal space for all those
laboratories, model rooms, lecture rooms, and other apartments, which
could only be secured on a sufficient scale at a seaport by a large
outlay of money. And, above all, it affords the readiest, as well as the
best, means of entering upon a much too long-neglected undertaking.</p>
</div>

<p>In the same issue (Sept. 20), the Times had a leader on the subject,
from which we take a few paragraphs.</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>It is certainly discouraging for a nation which has hitherto held,
and which means to keep, the first place in the world as a naval Power
to find that in systematic training Russia and Germany are dangerously
surpassing us. No doubt in the raw material of a navy we can compete
fearlessly with any country on the face of the earth; our sailors can
not be matched for enterprise, resolution, and discipline, nor can our
captains, in spite of some late disasters, be out-sailed or
out-manœuvred by any who sail under foreign flags. But we must not
forget that war on the seas, like war on land, is year by year becoming
more and more a scientific pursuit. Our magnificent iron-clad fleet, in
which Mr. Reed feels justly a parental interest, is too precious a
possession to be intrusted to men who do not know how to use so
two-edged an instrument. But how should our naval officers know how to
manage an iron-clad ship? They are taught nothing about the construction
of these triumphs of modern science; they do not, as a rule, possess
even the elementary knowledge which would enable them to commence the
study of the subject.</p>

<p>Whether the unequaled advantages offered by Greenwich Hospital be
turned to account or some more expensive method be adopted by a
Government which pins its credit on economy, the necessity of providing
for the education of naval officers can no longer be ignored. Not to
speak of the absolute absurdity of sending iron-clads to sea in charge
of officers who know no more of the construction of an iron-clad than
they know of the latest improvements in cotton-spinning machinery, it is
obvious that a system under which men whose business is to navigate
costly vessels of war, are sent to their work without knowing even the
elements of mathematics, must sooner or later result in a disastrous
collapse. It may be a question whether such has not been the case
already,&mdash;whether the recent mischances in the conduct at sea of
some of our finest vessels may not be traceable to the imperfect
education of the officers.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page945" id = "page945">945</a></span>
<p>When other nations are giving their sailors scientific teaching, and
when we are expending gigantic sums on the construction of a Navy which
must be handled in accordance with scientific principles, it appears
absurd, or worse, to allow the commanders and the officers of our
iron-clads to go to sea without the slightest guarantee for their
knowledge of the peculiar conditions under which one of our modern
monster ships is to be managed. If an iron-clad happens, as we may
presume, considering what has lately happened, is not impossible, to
strike upon a rock or otherwise seriously to damage herself at a
distance from home dockyards, the chances are that no one on board, from
the captain down to the carpenter, will know how to repair the
damage.</p>
</div>

<p>To the urgent demand for more scientific knowledge of naval
construction, Admiral Henry J. Rouse interposes a plea for more
seamanship, discipline, and education afloat. In the Times for Sept. 28,
the bluff Admiral says, rather bluntly:</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>I was alive to the want of seamanship and to the neglect of a naval
education from the moment a midshipman left his school and was appointed
to a steamer: but I always flattered myself there was one redeeming
point&mdash;namely&mdash;gunnery&mdash;in which the officers of the
present day had a wonderful preëminence over the old school. How is the
proposed college to ameliorate this state of things? Will it make the
young officers engineers when on board ship? They are not allowed to
interfere with the engineer, who is, in fact, the commanding officer.
Will warrant officers, carpenters, and gunners, be educated there? And
in answer to Mr. Reed relying upon the carpenter in the event of a ship
grounding (not an uncommon occurrence), we look to the captain to lay
out his anchors, lighten his ship and heave her off by purchase over
purchase; we do not consult the carpenter. Mr. Reed says,&mdash;“The men
who will have to design for our Navy will never be free to design the
best ships which can be provided until an improved education of the
whole naval service unbinds the hands of the <i>scientific servants</i>
of the Admiralty.”</p>

<p>Who are the scientific servants? Are the men who designed the
iron-bound monsters at the expense of half a million each; which have
every bad quality, which can neither sail, wear, nor stay better than a
coal barge, and which roll and pitch like maniacs owing to the weight of
their armor, and which are certain to founder if called upon to face a
very heavy gale? Are the servants scientific who stow their ballast on
empty cells, thereby preventing a ship righting herself if she heels
over 33 deg. under canvas, and which makes her capsize keel uppermost,
according to the simple law of gravitation which impels the vacuum to
the surface? Was the servant scientific who reduced a ship’s ballast 300
tons, and put a corresponding weight of iron on the upper works,
boasting he had retained the same line of immersion without calculating
the loss of stability, and did not the Admiralty listen to him like
countrymen to a mountebank, and reward him with a grant of money?</p>

<p>If a Greenwich College could diminish the frightful excesses and
expenditure in the last eight years in the building department, for
which the House of Commons demanded an investigation, which was
checkmated by sending a distinguished admiral to the Cape of Good Hope;
if it could instruct the scientific servants in the mysteries of their
vocation, and convert the simple landsmen in Charing-cross into naval
oracles; if it could make young officers seamen by inspiration, then I
should agree with Mr. Reed that a Greenwich College would be most
desirable.</p>

<p>As for the junior officers nothing but a sailing ship can educate a
seaman. If a midshipman loses the precious years from 14 to 17 in a
steamer he will be too old and proud to learn his profession, and when
later in life he is sent to take command of a prize ship under canvas in
war time he will look very foolish in half a gale of wind.</p>

<p>If any man will take the trouble to think, he must be convinced that
no ship of any size, no armor <i>clypei septemplicis</i>, no guns of 25
tons can compete with an iron-cased steam ram of about 1,200 tons,
invulnerable, bomb-proof, which would put five feet of cold steel under
a ship’s water line going 14 miles per hour. We are now building
gunboats to protect the coast. One of Mr. Drake’s steam rams of about
300 tons, without a gun mounted, would destroy a dozen
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page946" id = "page946">946</a></span>
of them. In the next naval action history will be repeated. Romans,
Carthagenians, and again the <i>naves rostratæ, alias</i> the Steam Ram,
will carry the day. It is wonderful that the Admiralty for the last
twenty years have been building their hogs in armor to defy shot and
shell, ignoring the terrible attack of this superior power. It is never
too late to mend. To save enormous sums of money and a waste of coal we
ought to pay off all our useless monsters, and during peace to
commission small ships with auxiliary screws, never to burn a coal
except in a case of necessity; and then, by keeping squadrons at sea, we
might improve our discipline, our seamanship, and <i>esprit de
corps</i>.</p>
</div>

<p>The letter of Admiral Rouse was accompanied by a leader in the Times
of the same date from which we take a few paragraphs.</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>The spirit of an English sailor of the old school, with his bluff,
outspoken, uncompromising detestation of change, and his unfaltering
belief that all that has been was right, is something to wonder at and
even admire, if we should not care to imitate it, in these days of
perpetual motion. He has observed, as we all have, with shame and
misgiving, that while the cost of our vast ironclad vessels of war is
growing yearly greater, the officers of the new generation who are to be
intrusted with the handling of these expensive monsters are not
comparable for practical skill and shiftiness with those of Admiral
Rouse’s contemporaries who dominated the seas in sailing frigates in the
days before either steam or ship-armor was devised. In his perception of
the defects of our present system the Admiral does not stand alone; it
is condemned by the ablest officers who are now in command of our
fleets, by the eminent engineers who construct them&mdash;unfortunately,
with still more eloquent urgency by the voice of our recent naval
annals. The misadventures of the Captain, the Psyche, and the Agincourt,
not to mention less serious mishaps, have startled us all, and the
seamanship of the British Navy has come to be gravely questioned.</p>
</div>

<p>Let us compare Admiral Rouse’s remedy with Mr. Reed’s.</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>The latter is dwelling on the custom of sending young boys to sea
with necessarily imperfect training, and of promoting them to the higher
grades, though in the meantime they have had no opportunities of
scientific instruction. He asserts the consequence is that very few of
the officers who command our costly iron-clads at the present day know
any thing of the construction or the qualities of those gigantic boating
masses. Admiral Rouse admits this fully, but he superadds a charge at
least as serious; he alleges that few or none of our modern naval
officers who spend the years of their apprenticeship to the sea on board
a steamer, and who “worship the boiler whenever they are in a scrape,”
do know or can know any thing of real seamanship. Mr. Reed says that the
study of the principles of shipbuilding is unknown among the officers of
our Navy, and that accordingly, few of them can handle an iron-clad.
Admiral Rouse says that the study of the winds and waves is neglected by
them, and that not many of them can sail a frigate. Mr. Reed demands a
Naval University to teach officers the theory of navigation as applied
to the vast masses of iron now afloat under our flag. Admiral Rouse
would get rid of these “useless monsters” altogether, would, during
peace, commission small “ships with auxiliary screws,” and “never burn a
coal except in case of necessity.” Here we have the ancient and the
modern spirit in contrast and juxtaposition. The former, obstinate and
often illogical, but with a certain rude and not unjustified faith in
practice, deserves our respect, for it was this spirit which won us, in
old times, our naval supremacy. The latter may be over-bold and
presumptuously contemptuous of the past and all its belongings; but it
is the spirit of progress, and on its guidance we have to depend for the
maintenance of the renown we achieved in the earlier and darker
time.</p>
</div>

<p>On the 20th of March, 1871, Capt. James G. Goodenough, R. N., read a
paper before the Royal United Service Institute, on the Preliminary
Education of Naval Officers, from which we make extracts.</p>

<div class = "in-one">
<p>I should be guilty of an absurd and forced indifference to what is
passing around me if I were not to say that an impression now exists
very generally in the service, that the views which finds most favor
with regard to the training
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page947" id = "page947">947</a></span>
of the officers of Her Majesty’s Navy is, that the naval officer should
be taught young; that he should be made to devote himself to the
details, and nothing but details of his profession from boyhood to
youth, and from youth to middle age, and that somewhere behind middle
age and old age, he should be deemed to be warrant, and be thrown away a
pensioner on the country’s gratitude, unfit even to have a voice in the
guidance of the affairs of the service to which he may have been an
ornament. This impression is doing much harm in all directions.</p>

<p>It is weakening the desire for knowledge and self-improvement in
naval officers; it is tending to narrow and circumscribe the idea of
responsibility of a naval commander for all things coming within his
ken, and to lower his conception of his own position from that of a
representative of his country in all parts of the world, an agent of her
policy, and a guardian of her commerce, to that of being a mere
executing tool, whose only argument is force.</p>

<p>The warning which I should give, and it contains the whole case, is
this,&mdash;that while all other circumstances of life at sea have
changed considerably in the last thirty years, the preliminary training
of our officers has not changed in its main features. It is not merely
that our material, whether in ships or guns, steamships or canvas, has
changed. It is not only that our material has become far more
complicated than of yore. If that alone were the case, the system of a
former age might supplant the wants of the day. No! the change whose
bearing we have failed to acknowledge, even though we may have perceived
it, is this, that while formerly the conduct of ships at sea, their
discipline, and the handling of their material generally, was based on
the experience obtained in the practical individual lives from early
years, and on an acquaintance with external phenomena and internal
details, which were not reduced to laws or elevated into systems; now,
we do possess rules and laws, which greatly reduce the value, if they do
not quite supersede, the practical experience of a single life. In every
one of the varied practical duties of a sea officer, this is the case,
whether in navigation or in discipline, in artillery or in manœuvring;
and I say that this constitutes the great change in a sea life to which
we have made no corresponding advance. I&nbsp;say that although those
laws and systems exist, we still continue to let the details which they
include be painfully and only practically acquired by experience,
instead of methodically teaching the principles on which they are
based.</p>

<p>The principles on which I consider that that education should rest
are these: <i>First</i>, that a distinction should be made between the
period of education and that of special training. <i>Second</i>, that
special training should be the business of the Government, while
education should be left to the care of the parents, at the ordinary
schools of the country. <i>Third</i>, that the handling of ships’ sails
and boats, and the principles of command should be methodically taught,
instead of, as at present, being left to chance observations and the
accidents of service. <i>Fourth</i>, that the young officers under
training in schoolships should have no command, except over each other,
and should count no sea time; and that on entering the service afloat in
sea-going ships, they should become at once, in some measure,
responsible officers, though liable to future examinations, and to
produce evidence of having done work after leaving the training-ships.
<i>Fifth</i>, that in order to discourage cramming, all entrance
examinations should be confined, as far as possible, to the subject of
study at advanced public schools, and that every candidate should be
required to bring with him certificates of a year’s good conduct from
his last school.</p>

<p>I wish to see a distinction made between the education and the
special training of naval officers. I&nbsp;do not pretend to give the
precise age at which this distinction should be made. It will
necessarily differ with different boys, and I would therefore have a two
years’ limit to the age of entry instead of one. My opinion is, that
special training should begin at from 14 to 16, and that it should be
continued from that age for three years; that is, from an average of 15
to an average of 18 in the college and sea-going training ships.</p>

<p>I should wish young officers to proceed thence to the ordinary
service afloat, and after two years’ service in a sea-going ship to be
admitted to pass an examination for lieutenants.</p>

<p>The examination for entry, which under the system I propose, would be
at the average age of 15, should take place in November of each year,
and should
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page948" id = "page948">948</a></span>
be arranged, as far as possible, so as to comprise subjects which do not
require special cramming, but are taught generally in our public
schools, omitting some, such as Greek, of which no further use or notice
would be made in their future career, and substituting French, or
another modern language in lieu.</p>

<p>The college would then open for the cadets on the 1st of February,
<ins class = "correction"
title = "text reads ‘and / and’ at line break">and</ins> while indoor studies of navigation, nautical astronomy
and modern languages occupied the mornings, the afternoons should be
devoted to practical seamanship until the first of May, when they should
embark in a corvette, especially set apart for their instruction, until
August.</p>

<p>During these four months they should perform every practical duty of
their profession with their own hands, under instruction, with plenty of
time, and with patient, steady instructors, and at the end of their
cruise, after an inspection by the governor of the college, they should
strip and clear their vessel before proceeding on a summer holiday.</p>

<p>During the cruise they should not only learn to take and work their
own observations for the position of the ship by the ordinary known
methods, but should also study the pilotage of the coast of England,
whenever visited.</p>

<p>After the vacation they should again rig their vessel, and until the
end of October should have instruction in rigging, masting, and so on,
while the weather permitted, as well as continuing to exercise in boats.
November and December being devoted to indoor studies and examination.
This would complete the first year of training.</p>

<p>The second year would begin as the first, with indoor studies in the
morning, the advanced seamanship class of the afternoon, alternating
with gunnery instruction classes until May, when the second class would
embark in a steam corvette, and in addition to the study of seamanship,
as in the first year, would join that of steam machinery. While the
cruise of the first year would have been on board a sailing corvette,
and on the south coast of England generally, that of the second year
should have been extended to the coasts of the United Kingdom and
western coast of Europe; and while the sailing corvette should be manned
by steady old seamen, and no attempt should be made at quickness of
manœuvre, the steam corvette for the second year should be manned by
active young trained able seamen, and all manœuvres should be performed
together, as in actual practice in man-of-war, the young cadets under
training working a mast.</p>

<p>At the end of this cruise, they would not only strip their vessel,
but would also take to pieces the principal parts of the machinery,
before the summer holidays and after inspection.</p>

<p>On recommencement of term in October, indoor studies should again be
taken up, and the final examination for the rank of midshipmen should
take place in December, the average age of the young officers being now
17 years.</p>

<p>I should now reassemble the midshipmen on February 1st, either on
board the gunnery ships or in a special ship attached to the college,
for a three months’ course in practical gunnery, after being examined in
which, they should be discharged into a full-rigged, full-manned frigate
for final instruction in the duties of an officer, under selected
captains, commanders, and lieutenants. They should here alternately take
the duties of officers of tops, officers of boats, officers in charge of
a particular mast, and in rotation as officers of the watch, under the
care and guidance of a lieutenant of each watch, while lectures and
exercise in manœuvres of ships and boats, of heavy and field guns, of
small-arm drills and landing parties, should be systematically taught
them. At the end of this cruise, which should extend to the
Mediterranean, an examination in seamanship should take place, and the
midshipmen would be discharged into the service afloat, at an average
age of 18 years, where they would serve as midshipmen for one year
before examination (as&nbsp;now) for sub-lieutenants.</p>

<p>Thus, the whole course of training would be two years at college, and
in training corvettes as cadets, and one year’s training in practical
gunnery, and instruction as an officer in various duties, with the rank
of midshipman performing all the duties of a subordinate officer, at the
conclusion of which an examination should take place in all the subjects
of the profession, whether at home or abroad. This preliminary education
should be followed by the modification of the navigating class, the
creation of an examination for the rank of lieutenant, and other changes
in rank.</p>

A <i>Cadet</i> in the military organization of the Army denoted a junior
officer between the grade of lieutenant and sergeant, and was introduced
from the French service. An Act of Congress, passed May 7th, 1794,
provided for a Corps of Artillerists and Engineers, to consist of four
battalions, to each of which eight <i>cadets</i> were to be attached,
and authorized the Secretary of War to procure at the public expense the
necessary books, instruments and apparatus for the use and benefit of
said corps. In 1798, an additional regiment of Artillerists and
Engineers was raised, increasing the number of Cadets to fifty-six. In
1798, the President was authorized to appoint four teachers of the Arts
and Sciences necessary to Artillerists and Engineers. No appointment was
made till 1801, and in 1802, the Military Academy was established at
West Point, where the corps of Engineers was directed to repair with
fifty Cadets, and the Senior Officer of the Corps was constituted
Superintendent. Col. Williams was then Senior Officer of Engineers, and
became, <i>ex-officio</i>, Superintendent, and continued such until
1812.</p>

Captain Partridge attached much importance to pedestrian excursions in
reference both to hygenic, and educational considerations. To these

knowledge of all the details of American battles. In one year, (1830,)
he made four excursions from Norwich, each occupying from four to six
days&mdash;and from one hundred and fifty to four hundred
miles&mdash;the last day’s walk generally averaging over sixty miles. He
had ascended and measured the altitude of all the highest mountain

An early friend of this institution, on learning the fact stated in the
same Report of 1862, from which the above extract is taken, “that in the
course of six years one hundred and twenty-four students were turned
back to pursue a second time portions of the academic course,” and of
this number only six passed the final examination, (thereby costing the
country over $300,000 in pay, salaries, and equipment, for absolutely
nothing, and at the same time depriving the naval service of an equal
number of competent young officers,) writes to a member of this Board as
follows:&mdash;“I have had the curiosity to question fifty middies, as I
happened to meet with them, without selection, and representing
different classes in the institution and different States, as to the
circumstances of their appointment&mdash;and of these fifty, forty were
the near relations or sons of political friends of the parties making
the nominations, and five were the sons of persons in official stations
at Washington, although appointed ‘at large,’ leaving but five for
selection from other sources. In several cases the answers were
significant&mdash;‘My father had to bleed freely for my appointment.’
‘My brother worked hard for his election.’ ‘I&nbsp;had the promise of a
cadetship at West Point, but as there was no vacancy that year,
I&nbsp;got an appointment here.’ ‘I&nbsp;am an exchange. Senator
&mdash;&mdash; got an appointment for Mr. C.’s nephew, and Mr. C.
nominated Senator &mdash;&mdash; friend’s son for the
place.’”&mdash;[<i>Ed. of Amer. Journal of Education.</i>]</p>
